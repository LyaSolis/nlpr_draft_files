Patients received rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil every four weeks for six cycles. Rituximab plus chlorambucil-treated patients without a complete response after Cycle 6 received chlorambu- cil monotherapy for at least six additional cycles or until complete response. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (confirmed by bone marrow biopsy) after Cycle 6 in first-line patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease, and safety. Overall, 357 patients were randomized (rit- uximab plus bendamustine, n=178; rituximab plus chlorambucil, n=179; intent-to-treat population), including 241 first-line patients (n=121 and n=120, respectively); 355 patients received treatment (n=177 and n=178, respectively; safety population). In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; P=0.002) and median progression-free survival (ritux- imab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil,  30 months; P=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall sur- vival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus ben- damustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% vs. 36%). Overall adverse event incidence was similar (rituximab plus bendamustine, 98%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 97%).

Chemotherapy options for these patients include bendamustine (B) and chlorambucil (Clb). In treatment-naïve CLL patients, phase II studies showed promising efficacy with rituximab plus B (R-B) Clb (R-Clb), 8,9  while the phase III CLL11 study demon- strated improved efficacy with R-Clb and obinutuzumab plus Clb (G-Clb) versus Clb monotherapy. 10,11 G-Clb also increased progression-free survival (PFS) and complete response (CR) rates versus R-Clb, 10,11 although infusion- related reactions and neutropenia were more common; infection rates were not increased, however. While a phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of CR and PFS with B versusClb in treatment-naïve CLL, 12,13 the activity of R-B versusR-Clb has not been directly com- pared. Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients.

Methods  Study design  Patients received rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m Day [D] 1, Cycle [C] 1 and 500 mg/m D1, C2-C6) plus B (intravenous 90 mg/m [1L] or 70 mg/m [2L] D1 and D2, C1-C6) or Clb (oral 10 mg/m D1-D7, C1-C6) every four weeks for six cycles. R-Clb patients without CR after C6 received Clb monotherapy for ≤6 additional cycles or until CR. After treatment completion, patients were followed every three months for one year, then every six months until data cut-off. Treatment was discontinued if the patient had progressive disease. MABLE was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local laws, and approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees at participating centers. All patients provided written informed con- sent. Patients Patients were aged ≥18 years, with confirmed CLL requiring treatment as per the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) cri- teria, Binet stage B/C disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, and investigator assess- ment of ineligibility for fludarabine-based treatment (Online Supplementary Information). Exclusion criteria included transforma- tion to aggressive B-cell malignancy and previous malignancy within five years of enrollment (unless treated with curative intent). For full inclusion and exclusion criteria see the Online Supplementary Information. During recruitment, the protocol was amended to permit inclu- sion of patients with progressive Binet stage A disease and to exclude 2L patients (due to slow recruitment). All 2L patients recruited before this amendment were included in the final analy- sis, as tumor response in this patient subpopulation was a second- ary study endpoint; however, as the number of 2L patients enrolled was relatively small, there was insufficient power to show statistically significant differences between study treat- ments in this patient subpopulation. Study endpoints The primary endpoint was CR rate (confirmed by bone marrow [BM] biopsy) after C6 in 1L patients. Secondary endpoints includ- ed CR rate after C6 in 2L patients, PFS, overall survival (OS), time to next leukemic treatment, minimal residual disease (MRD), and safety. Response was assessed after C3 and C6 as per iwCLL 2008 guidelines. Response was also assessed in the R-Clb arm at C12, with treatment being discontinued for patients showing evidence of CR during C7-C12.

Statistical analysis Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients). The safety population included all randomized patients who received treatment. For 1L patients, the between-arm difference in response rates was tested using a one-sided continuity-corrected χ test. A two- sided continuity-corrected χ test assessed between-arm differ- ences in overall response rates (ORRs) and molecular responses.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con- fidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on the Cox propor- tional hazard model, with and without baseline Binet stage as a covariate. Results Patients The study was conducted between 23 February 2010 and 31 March 2014. Of the 357 patients in the ITT popu- lation, comprising 241 1L patients (R-B, n=121; R-Clb, n=120) and 116 2L patients (R-B, n=57; R-Clb, n=59), 355 received treatment (R-B, n=177; R-Clb, n=178). Ninety- five patients (27%) withdrew from treatment during the study (Figure 1). Overall, 92/120 (76.7%) 1L patients treated with R-B and 97/120 (80.8%) 1L patients treated with R-Clb received six cycles of rituximab; 92 (76.7%) and 57 (47.5%) received six cycles of B and Clb, respectively. Twelve (10.0%) patients treated with R-Clb received 12 cycles of Clb. The median number of R, B and Clb doses was six for each. The median (interquartile range) dose of rituximab was 4780.5 mg (4222.5-5346.5) in 1L patients treated with R-B and 5028.5 mg (4546.0-5349.0) in 1L patients treated with R-Clb. In total, 6/121 (5.0%) patients treated with R-B and 2/120 (1.7%) patients treated with R- Clb had a reduction or delay in their treatment schedule due to treatment-emergent toxicities. Baseline characteristics were balanced in the 1L popula- tion (Table 1; baseline characteristics for all patients are presented in Online Supplementary Table S1). Deletion of 17p was not an exclusion criterion due to a lack of efficacy data relating to 17p deletion for the treatment combina- tions used at the time of study design. Thus, 13 1L patients (R-B, 10; R-Clb, 3) with 17p deletion were includ- ed. Median follow-up was 23.5 months (R-B) and 23.3 months (R-Clb).

In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; P=0.002) and median progression-free survival (ritux- imab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil,  30 months; P=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall sur- vival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus ben- damustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% vs. 36%).

Chemotherapy options for these patients include bendamustine (B) and chlorambucil (Clb). In treatment-naïve CLL patients, phase II studies showed promising efficacy with rituximab plus B (R-B) Clb (R-Clb), 8,9  while the phase III CLL11 study demon- strated improved efficacy with R-Clb and obinutuzumab plus Clb (G-Clb) versus Clb monotherapy. 10,11 G-Clb also increased progression-free survival (PFS) and complete response (CR) rates versus R-Clb, 10,11 although infusion- related reactions and neutropenia were more common; infection rates were not increased, however. While a phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of CR and PFS with B versusClb in treatment-naïve CLL, 12,13 the activity of R-B versusR-Clb has not been directly com- pared. Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. ',\n"," 'Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. Methods  Study design  Patients received rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m Day [D] 1, Cycle [C] 1 and 500 mg/m D1, C2-C6) plus B (intravenous 90 mg/m [1L] or 70 mg/m [2L] D1 and D2, C1-C6) or Clb (oral 10 mg/m D1-D7, C1-C6) every four weeks for six cycles. R-Clb patients without CR after C6 received Clb monotherapy for ≤6 additional cycles or until CR. After treatment completion, patients were followed every three months for one year, then every six months until data cut-off. Treatment was discontinued if the patient had progressive disease. MABLE was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local laws, and approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees at participating centers. All patients provided written informed con- sent. Patients Patients were aged ≥18 years, with confirmed CLL requiring treatment as per the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) cri- teria, Binet stage B/C disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, and investigator assess- ment of ineligibility for fludarabine-based treatment (Online Supplementary Information). Exclusion criteria included transforma- tion to aggressive B-cell malignancy and previous malignancy within five years of enrollment (unless treated with curative intent). For full inclusion and exclusion criteria see the Online Supplementary Information. During recruitment, the protocol was amended to permit inclu- sion of patients with progressive Binet stage A disease and to exclude 2L patients (due to slow recruitment). All 2L patients recruited before this amendment were included in the final analy- sis, as tumor response in this patient subpopulation was a second- ary study endpoint; however, as the number of 2L patients enrolled was relatively small, there was insufficient power to show statistically significant differences between study treat- ments in this patient subpopulation. Study endpoints The primary endpoint was CR rate (confirmed by bone marrow [BM] biopsy) after C6 in 1L patients. Secondary endpoints includ- ed CR rate after C6 in 2L patients, PFS, overall survival (OS), time to next leukemic treatment, minimal residual disease (MRD), and safety. Response was assessed after C3 and C6 as per iwCLL 2008 guidelines. Response was also assessed in the R-Clb arm at C12, with treatment being discontinued for patients showing evidence of CR during C7-C12. ',\n"," 'Assessments are detailed in the Online Supplementary Information. Safety Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs v4.0 and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v17.0. Statistical analysis Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients). The safety population included all randomized patients who received treatment. For 1L patients, the between-arm difference in response rates was tested using a one-sided continuity-corrected χ test. A two- sided continuity-corrected χ test assessed between-arm differ- ences in overall response rates (ORRs) and molecular responses. PFS and OS were summarized by Kaplan–Meier estimates and compared viathe log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con- fidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on the Cox propor- tional hazard model, with and without baseline Binet stage as a covariate.

Ninety- five patients (27%) withdrew from treatment during the study (Figure 1). Overall, 92/120 (76.7%) 1L patients treated with R-B and 97/120 (80.8%) 1L patients treated with R-Clb received six cycles of rituximab; 92 (76.7%) and 57 (47.5%) received six cycles of B and Clb, respectively. Twelve (10.0%) patients treated with R-Clb received 12 cycles of Clb. The median number of R, B and Clb doses was six for each. The median (interquartile range) dose of rituximab was 4780.5 mg (4222.5-5346.5) in 1L patients treated with R-B and 5028.5 mg (4546.0-5349.0) in 1L patients treated with R-Clb. In total, 6/121 (5.0%) patients treated with R-B and 2/120 (1.7%) patients treated with R- Clb had a reduction or delay in their treatment schedule due to treatment-emergent toxicities. Baseline characteristics were balanced in the 1L popula- tion (Table 1; baseline characteristics for all patients are presented in Online Supplementary Table S1). Deletion of 17p was not an exclusion criterion due to a lack of efficacy data relating to 17p deletion for the treatment combina- tions used at the time of study design. Thus, 13 1L patients (R-B, 10; R-Clb, 3) with 17p deletion were includ- ed. Median follow-up was 23.5 months (R-B) and 23.3 months (R-Clb).

Colony-stimulating factors were taken more frequently by patients treated with R-B (111/178 [62.4%] vs. 71/179 [39.7%] for R-Clb). ECOG performance status scores were ≥1 in approximately half the study population. At base- line, 108/177 (61.0%), 56/177 (31.6%) and 4/177 (2.3%) patients treated with R-B, and 102/178 (57.3%), 60/178 (33.7%) and 3/178 (1.7%) patients treated with R-Clb had normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant; and abnor- mal clinically significant calculated creatinine clearance, respectively. Efficacy In 1L patients, the CR rate after C6 was higher with R- B versus R-Clb (24% [n=29/121] vs. 9% [n=11/120]; P=0.002; Table 2). Logistic regression analysis supported the R-B treatment effect after adjusting for baseline covari- ates (odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI 1.77-9.87; P=0.001). None of the covariates had a statistically significant impact on the CR rate. ORRs (based on the investigator’s assessment) at the end of rituximab treatment were similar for R-B and R-Clb (91% vs.86%; P=0.304). The proportion of patients with stable disease (3% vs.6%) and progressive disease (3% vs. 2%) at the end of treatment were also similar for R-B vs. R-Clb, respectively.

During the study, 11/121 (9.1%) patients treated with R-B and 22/120 (18.3%) patients treated with R-Clb had a documented intake of any new leukemia treatment. Due to the low numbers, the median time to next leukemic treatment could not be calculated for either treatment arm (log-rank test for com- parison between treatment arms: P=0.037). MRD data were available for 45/50 patients (90%) who had a CR based on the investigator’s assessment and 182/241 patients (76%) overall. BM aspirates were avail- able for 42/45 patients (93%) and 145/182 patients (80%), respectively. MRD-negativity rates at the confirmation-of- response visit (ITT population) were higher for R-B than for R-Clb (41% vs. 13%; Table 3). In 1L patients with a CR after C6, MRD-negativity rates at the confirmation-of- response visit were higher in the R-B group than in the R- Clb group (66% vs. 36%). A similar pattern was seen in those with a CR or PR according to investigator’s assess- ment (53% vs. 18%). Efficacy results in 2L patients are presented in the Online Supplementary Information. Safety Safety results are presented for the pooled population (1L and 2L patients). AEs were similar between arms (R-B, 98%; R-Clb, 97%; Table 4). The most common AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) were ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ (R-B, 75%; R-Clb, 64%); the most com- monly reported AE was neutropenia (R-B, 56%; R-Clb, 49%). ',\n"," 'AEs in the SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue dis- orders’ were more frequent in the R-B versus R-Clb arm (36% vs. 23%), driven by a higher incidence of rash (16% vs. 5%). Grade ≥3 AEs were higher with R-B (75%) than R-Clb (64%), mainly due to a higher incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) of the SOC ‘infections and infestations’. The most common grade ≥3 AEs were of the SOC ‘blood and lym- phatic system disorders’ (R-B, 56%; R-Clb, 47%). SAEs were experienced by 41% (R-B) and 32% (R-Clb) of patients, and were most frequently of the SOC ‘infections and infestations’ (R-B, 19%; R-Clb, 8%; Table 4). Rituximab-related AEs were experienced by 81% (R-B) and 73% (R-Clb) of patients. B/Clb-related AEs were reported for 92% (R-B) and 80% (R-Clb) of patients. Drug- related AEs (rituximab, B, and Clb) were most commonly of the SOC ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’. AEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were experienced by 18% (R-B) and 11% (R-Clb) of patients. AEs leading to dis- continuation of B or Clb were reported for 19% and 18% of patients, respectively. In 1L patients, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were experienced by 22 R-B patients (18%) and 14 R-Clb patients (12%). Overall, 65 patients died (R-B, n=30, 17%; R-Clb, n=35, 20%) due to CLL (R-B, n=14, 8%; R-Clb, n=20, 11%) and AEs (R-B, n=16, 9%; R-Clb, n=14, 8%). Cause of death was missing for one patient (R-Clb arm). AEs leading to death were infection (n=4 per arm), acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1 per arm), other neoplasm (R-Clb, n=1), and other causes (R-B, n=11; R-Clb, n=8). Treatment-related AEs leading to death included thrombocytopenia, neutropenic sepsis and febrile neutropenia (n=1 each) in the 1L population and multi-organ failure, pneumonia, acute myeloid leukemia and sepsis (n=1 each) in the 2L population. Discussion R-FC is the standard 1L treatment for medically-fit patients with CLL. However, this regimen can cause sig- nificant myelosuppression and high rates of early and late infections, especially in elderly patients who may have comorbidities and be considered ineligible for fludarabine- based treatment. In MABLE, the efficacy and safety of R- B and R-Clb were investigated in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. B is an established treatment for CLL, and a previous phase III study of B versusClb in treatment-naïve patients demonstrated improved CR rates and median PFS with B. ',\n"," '12,13 R combined with chemotherapeutic agents pro- longs OS in previously untreated, medically fit CLL patients. 16,17  In unfit patients, survival was improved by the addition of G to Clb. Among 1L patients in MABLE, the rates of CR and of CR with MRD-negativity were higher for R-B than for R- Clb. ORRs were similar in the two arms. Whereas the CR rate in 1L R-Clb patients in MABLE (9%) was comparable with that in R-Clb patients in the phase III CLL11 study (7%), the ORR for R-Clb-treated patients was higher in MABLE than in CLL11 (86% vs. 58%). Two explanations for this might be the different Clb doses used (MABLE, 10 -S. Michallet et al. 702 haematologica | 2018; 103(4) Table 3.

MRD data were available for 45/50 patients with a CR based on the investigator’s assessment (BM, n=42; PB, n=1; unknown=2) and 182/241 patients overall (BM, n=145; PB, n=32; unknown=5).

Earlier phase II studies in elderly CLL patients treated 1L with R-Clb reported CR rates of 10-17% and ORRs of 82-84%. ',\n"," '8,9 The CLL2M trial, a phase II study of CLL patients treated 1L with R-B, at the same B dosage as the current study, reported a CR rate of 23% and an ORR of 88%. In 1L patients in the study reported herein, the median PFS of 39.6 months in the R-B arm was significantly longer (by 10 months) than the value in the R-Clb arm. This result is similar to the median PFS of 43.2 months achieved in fit CLL patients treated with R-B in the CLL10 study, and is consistent with the findings of the CLL2M study, which enrolled fit and unfit 1L patients and report- ed a median event-free survival in R-B-treated patients of 33.9 months. The CLL2M study did not select patients by fitness, but a substantial proportion could be considered unfit based on age, Binet stage, and renal impairment. MABLE, 33% of the 1L patients were Binet stage C and the median age was 72 years. The PFS result in the R-Clb arm in MABLE was almost twice as long as that in CLL11 (29.9 vs. 15.4 months), however, as noted above, a direct comparison of these studies is limited by differences in Clb doses and patient fitness. In MABLE, 1L patients with CR had higher MRD-nega- tivity rates with R-B versus R-Clb, indicating a greater depth of response with R-B. Of note, MRD was assessed primarily in BM from patients with CR based on the investigator’s assessment, whereas in CLL11 and previous phase II studies, MRD was measured in peripheral blood ([PB] or BM) from all patients. 7,8,10 One phase II study reported a MRD-negativity rate of 12.5% (2/16 patients) using BM aspirates from R-Clb-treated patients who achieved a CR/unconfirmed CR. Median OS was not significantly different between treatment arms in 1L patients in MABLE and was not reached in previous phase II studies of R-B and R-Clb, 7-9  in the CLL11 and COMPLEMENT-1 studies. 11,19 At current follow-up reported for CLL11 and COMPLEMENT-1, no significant OS benefit was observed for G-Clb versus R-Clb or ofatumumab plus Clb (Ofa-Clb) versus Clb, respectively, 11,19 whereas a significant improvement was observed for G-Clb versusClb alone. Further observation is required to determine if there is an OS benefit with  G-Clb versusR-Clb or Ofa-Clb versusClb. ',\n"," 'Safety profiles (for pooled 1L and 2L patients) were sim- ilar for R-Clb and R-B, with no new or clinically relevant safety signals, and events were as expected for CLL patients receiving immunochemotherapy. 7-9  Incidences of all-grade AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs were sim- ilar across arms. Grade ≥3 AE incidence was slightly high- er with R-B versusR-Clb, driven by a higher incidence of Rituximab plus bendamustine or chlorambucil in CLL haematologica | 2018; 103(4) 703 Figure 2. Efficacy in 1L patients. (A) PFS and (B) OS.

Few patients in either arm dis- continued therapy due to AEs. Treatment withdrawal due to AEs was reported for 18% of patients receiving 1L R-B and 12% receiving R-Clb. As previously noted, the results of the CLL11 study show that, in unfit CLL patients, G-Clb was associated with higher response rates and longer PFS than R-Clb, with more frequent MRD eradication and an acceptable toxicity profile. In addition, current guidelines, (European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network), recommend Clb in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody as standard 1L therapy in unfit CLL patients. 20,21 However, in MABLE and previous studies, R-B was associated with a good response rate and improved PFS compared with R-Clb. Currently, evidence to guide the choice between R-B and G-Clb in 1L unfit patients with CLL is limited, although a recent meta- analysis of PFS and OS results in five studies showed a trend towards better efficacy for G-Clb than R-B; how- ever, the difference was not significant despite a signifi- cant difference between G-Clb and other comparators such as R-Clb, Ofa-Clb, Clb, and fludarabine. A random- ized trial comparing these combinations could resolve this question. Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Since we relied only on investigator assessments of tumor response to evaluate efficacy, and did not include assess- ments by an independent review committee, this might have introduced a potential bias in the efficacy results. Comparison of our results with those of other studies in CLL patients is potentially complicated because the selec- tion of patients based on fitness was based on a judgment made by the investigator that the patients were not eligi- ble for fludarabine, according to a set of pre-defined crite- -S.

However, a recent randomized study comparing the efficacy of ibruti- nib with Clb used an age cut-off of 65 years as the only criterion for selecting “older” patients, and did not carry out any assessment of comorbidities. ',\n"," 'Although the efficacy of immunochemotherapy combi- nations such as R-B, Ofa-Clb, and G-Clb in CLL have been shown, 7,11,19 obinutuzumab plus B (G-B) needs to be evalu- ated further, although it is likely that future clinical studies will focus more on the combination of anti-CD20 anti- bodies with novel agents such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax. Indeed, these agents have shown promising efficacy when combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (including rituximab) in the relapsed/refractory CLL setting, 24-29  and are now being evaluated in 1L. Furthermore, additional safety data for 1L B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors are required. In March 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration alerted healthcare pro- fessionals about safety concerns with idelalisib when used in combination with rituximab or R-B in CLL and follicu- lar lymphoma. This was related to a high rate of viral and fungal infections that led the sponsor to discontinue six trials. However, given the economic burden associated with new agents and the fact that BCR inhibitors are not yet available in many European countries, immunochemother- apy combinations are likely to continue to be valuable treat- ment options for 1L patients with CLL. In conclusion, in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients, 1L R-B treatment significantly improved CR rates and medi- an PFS versusR-Clb, and increased MRD-negativity rates, with no new safety signals reported. R-B may be a valu- able 1L option for fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients and this combination continues to be widely used in clinical practice in Europe, reinforcing the interest of this large randomized study.

Despite  multiple treatment options available, responses in relapsed  disease are typically incomplete and are of relatively short  duration, and therapy is commonly complicated by cytope- nias and infections [1 – 3]. A more targeted approach in the  treatment of CLL could have the benefi t of high effi cacy with  low toxicity. Th e phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is  known to be a central mechanism by which CLL lymphocytes  survive and evade apoptosis. Constitutive activation of  AKT promotes CLL lymphocyte survival, while inhibition of  the AKT pathway induces CLL lymphocyte death [4]. Because  of these fi ndings, we sought to evaluate the eff ect of pharma- cologic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells. Perifosine is an alkylphospholipid that was shown to  inhibit phosphorylation of AKT by blocking the membrane  localization of AKT and thus interfering with the interac- tion of PI3K with AKT [5]. ',\n"," 'myeloma and Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia,  two B-cell malignancies [6 – 8]. In these B-cell lymphoprolif- erative disorders, effi cacy of perifosine was linked to its inhi- bition of signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because  CLL is a related B-cell malignancy that relies on the PI3K/ AKT pathway for viability, we hypothesized that perifosine  would have anti-CLL activity mediated through its inhibition  of AKT phosphorylation. Materials and methods  Clinical study design and subjects  Patients with histologically confi rmed relapsed or refrac- tory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who  required therapy were eligible for this phase II clinical trial  at Duke University Medical Center. Th e primary objective  was to evaluate the response rate of perifosine in patients  with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. Secondary objec- tives included assessing toxicity, evaluating overall survival  and event-free survival, and performing laboratory-based  correlates of clinical effi cacy. Eligibility criteria included age 18 years of age, Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  of 0 – 2, creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min, and aspartate  aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  and total bilirubin 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Abstract  Because of the importance of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase  (PI3K)/AKT pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we  evaluated in vitro cytotoxicity induced by perifosine, an AKT  inhibitor, in CLL lymphocytes and found that the mean 50%  eff ective dose (ED  ) was 313 nM. We then performed a phase  II trial of perifosine in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL  to assess response, outcomes, toxicity and ex vivo correlative  measures. After 3 months of treatment, six of eight patients  showed stable disease, one achieved a partial response and  one had progressive disease. Median event-free survival and  overall survival in all patients treated were 3.9 and 9.7 months. Adverse events included hematologic, infectious/fever, pain,  gastrointestinal and constitutional toxicities. Unexpectedly,  AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes from treated patients  was not correlated with response. Additionally, perifosine did  not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. Perifosine is cytotoxic to CLL cells in vitro , and largely induces  stabilized disease in vivo , with an AKT-independent mechanism.

Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, human immunode- fi ciency virus infection, concurrent severe medical or  psychiatric illness that could interfere with participation  in the clinical study, other malignancy within 3 years of  enrollment (excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer,  early stage prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cer- vix), prior allogeneic stem cell transplant with 2% donor  cell engraftment, signifi cant cardiovascular disease within  6 months, active autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune  thrombocytopenia, prolymphocytic leukemia or Richter  transformation. Prognostic markers and disease status were assessed  prior to initiation of therapy. Th ese included bone marrow  biopsy and aspirate, cross-sectional imaging of the neck,  chest, abdomen and pelvis, immunoglobulin heavy chain  variable (IGHV) gene mutation status determination, fl ow  cytometry for ZAP70 and CD38, interphase cytogenetics for  11q23, 12cen, 13q14 and 17p13 using fl uorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetics. Prog- nostic markers were determined by clinical laboratories at  Duke University [9], but in rare cases of missing data, some  prognostic markers were measured in the research labora- tory as described in the “ In vitro evaluation of perifosine ”  section below. Th e Duke University institutional review board (IRB)  approved the protocol and all study participants provided  written informed consent. Th e clinical study was registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00873457). Target accrual was  based on the estimated patient accrual rate at our single  institution as well as estimates for statistical confi dence. Th ere was no offi cial stopping rule or interim analysis,  although the protocol stipulated consideration of stopping  the clinical trial early if there were one or less responders  in the fi rst 12 accrued patients. Perifosine was supplied by  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Clinical study treatment plan  Perifosine was administered at 50 mg orally, twice daily on a  continuous treatment schedule, for up to six 28-day cycles. Patients were instructed to take perifosine with food. Dose  modifi cations were prescribed for persistent grade 2 and  for grade 3/4 adverse events. For persistent grade 2 adverse  events, perifosine was reduced to once daily dosing. ',\n"," 'For  grade 3/4 adverse events, perifosine was held for at least  1 week, and restarted once the toxicity improved to grade 1  or returned to baseline. Supportive care, including antibiotic  prophylaxis, antiemetic prophylaxis, diarrhea management  and hyperuricemia prophylaxis, were at the discretion of the  treating physician. Patients were followed monthly, with physical exami- nations, blood counts and manual leukocyte diff erential. Interim responses were evaluated after three cycles of  therapy with evaluation and comparison of blood counts  and cross-sectional imaging to those obtained prior to  therapy initiation. Final responses were evaluated after six  cycles of therapy. Response to therapy was classifi ed based  on the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic  Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria [10]. Toxicities were documented  according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version  3.0). Hematologic toxicities were also evaluated using the  iwCLL criteria [10]. Ex vivo correlative studies  Laboratory-based correlative studies were performed to  evaluate ex vivo CLL lymphocytes for biomarkers associ- ated with clinical response. For cytotoxicity, apoptosis and  immunoblot assays, CLL cells were isolated and purifi ed, as  described previously [11]. For fl ow cytometry assessment of  phosphorylated protein expression, we used whole blood. Plasma was used to measure perifosine concentration. Between 10 and 50 mL of blood was collected prior to initia- tion of therapy (cycle 1 day 1), on cycle 1 day 8, on cycle 4 day  1 and at completion of perifosine. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using the MTS [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2- (4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous  One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega). We evaluated  CLL cell apoptosis and death using a caspase-3 activity assay  (EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit #2 - Z-DEVD-R110 Substrate;  Life Technologies) and by fl ow cytometric measurement of  Annexin V – fl uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (BD Biosci- ences) expression and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion  (Sigma). Assays were performed as described previously [12]  and according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. We performed phospho-fl ow assays on whole blood col- lected from patients during the clinical study. Six hundred  microliters of whole blood was incubated with BD Lyse/Fix  Buff er, washed with phosphate buff ered saline (PBS) and  permeabilized with BD Perm Buff er III. ',\n"," 'Up to 1 10 6 cells  were combined with antibodies listed below for 30 min and  resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Flow cytom- etry was performed as described below. When adequate CLL lymphocytes were available, we  assessed total AKT and phosphorylated AKT using immu- noblots. Cells were lysed with RIPA buff er (Cell Signaling  Technology), cOmplete Mini ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied  Science) and Tyr and Ser/Th r phosphatase inhibitor cock- tail set (Millipore). Cell lysates (50 μ g for phospho-AKT and  20 μ g for AKT) were electorphoresed and blotted onto poly- vinylidene fl uoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were  blocked and incubated with phospho-AKT (S473) rabbit  polyclonal and AKT rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies  (Cell Signaling Technology). Th e immunoblots were then  incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG), horse- radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody (Cell  Signaling Technology) and SuperSignal (Th ermo Scien- tifi c). We used phospho- or non-phospho-AKT cell extracts  (Cell Signaling Technology) as a positive/normalization  control across immunoblots. Band density was quantifi ed  and expressed as a ratio of phospho-AKT band density to  total AKT band density, and normalized to the cell extract  control band density. Plasma perifosine concentration was determined at  the University of Wisconsin using a reversed-phase liquid  chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry method  described previously [13]. Perifosine in CLL 1069 In vitro evaluation of perifosine  CLL lymphocytes were obtained from patients followed at  the Duke University and the Durham VA Medical Center. Th ese patients were enrolled in IRB-approved research pro- tocols to collect clinical data and primary patient samples. Patients ’ charts were reviewed to collect and/or calculate  certain prognostic information, such as Rai stage at diagno- sis, lymphocyte doubling time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  and β  -microglobulin (B2M). Isolation and purifi cation of CLL lymphocytes and deter- mination of molecular prognostic markers were performed,  as described previously [11]. Perifosine was obtained from  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Cytotoxicity was measured after  a 3-day incubation of primary CLL cells with serial dilutions  of perifosine in Hybridoma SFM medium (Gibco) using the  MTS assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Pro- liferation Assay, Promega) and fractional cytotoxicity was  determined, all as described before [14]. ',\n"," 'Th ereafter, dose – response curves and the concentration eff ective at killing  50% of CLL cells (ED  ) were calculated. Phospho-fl ow cytometry was performed to determine  the intracellular content of phosphorylated protein kinases  in purifi ed CLL lymphocytes. CLL cells were evaluated at  a 0 h time point and after 1 h of incubation in serum-free  medium with or without anti-IgM (20 μ g/mL goat anti- human IgM; Southern Biotech), perifosine (10 μ M) and/ or LY294002 (25 μ M; Invitrogen). Th e concentration of  perifosine was chosen based on in vitro testing in multiple  myeloma cells [7]. Th e anti-IgM was added for the last  10 min of incubation. One million cells per condition were  fi xed with BD Phosfl ow Lyse/Fix Buff er III (BD Biosciences)  and stored at 80 ° C. After thawing all replicate samples,  the cells were permeabilized with BD Phosfl ow Perm  Buff er (BD Biosciences) and were stained with antibod- ies to CD5, CD20, CD19 and a phosphoprotein, as out- lined in Supplementary Table I available online at http:// informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013. 824080. Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickin- son LSRII fl ow cytometer. Analysis of fl ow cytometry results  was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.). CLL cells were identifi ed based on forward and side scat- ter characteristics as well as co-expression of CD5, CD19 and  CD20. Phosphoprotein content was evaluated using a “ fl uo- rescence minus one ” (FMO) approach. For each experiment,  the mean fl uorescence intensity (MFI) in the PE channel  without the test antibody was subtracted from the MFI with  a test antibody. For in vitro experiments, the change in MFI  under each experimental condition was normalized to base- line MFI using the equation: normalized MFI [(test MFI  FMO MFI)/(test MFI at time 0 FMO MFI)]. Statistical analysis  Patients completing three and six cycles of perifosine were  evaluated for responses. Event-free survival (EFS) was  defi ned as the time from initiation of perifosine to disease  progression, subsequent treatment or death. Overall survival  (OS) was defi ned as the time from initiation of perifosine to  death [10]. All treated patients were evaluated for toxicity,  EFS and OS. ',\n"," 'Kaplan – Meier analyses and graphs of EFS and OS were  performed using the survival package in R [15]. Follow-up  time was defi ned as time from start of therapy to death or  the current time (if still living). Dose – response curves and  evaluation of ED  were performed using the drc pack- age in R [16]. Statistical comparison of phospho-AKT in  CLL lymphocytes was performed using the paired t -test. Pearson ’ s correlation was used to evaluate for associations  between continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum  test or Kruskal – Wallis test were used to assess for associa- tions between discrete variables and continuous variables,  respectively. A p -value of 0.05 was considered signifi cant. Th ese statistical analyses were performed in the statistical  environment R, version 2.11.1. Results  Perifosine induces in vitro CLL cell toxicity  Perifosine has previously been evaluated for its in vitro eff ect  on B-cell malignancies, such as multiple myeloma [6 – 8]. We evaluated the extent to which perifosine induces in vitro  cytotoxicity in purifi ed CLL lymphocytes, since activation  of the PI3K/AKT pathway is known to promote cell survival  in this malignancy [4]. Twenty-six primary CLL cell samples  obtained from patients not undergoing therapy were tested  for cell viability using the colorimetric MTS assay after  incubation with a range of concentrations of perifosine. the samples with evaluable data, 12 samples had mutated  IGHV, while 11 samples were unmutated. Twenty samples  had low CD38 ( 30%) expression and six samples had high  CD38 expression. Eleven samples had low ZAP70 ( 20%)  expression and 15 samples had high ZAP70 expression. Using the D ö hner classifi cation for interphase cytogenetics  [17], eight samples had 13q deletion, six had normal cyto- genetics, three had trisomy 12, four had 11q deletion and  two had 17p deletion. As seen in Figure 1, perifosine induces CLL lymphocyte  toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean ED  313 74 nM (standard error). ',\n"," 'Th e calculated in vitro ED  perifosine in these samples had no signifi cant correlation to  molecular prognostic markers or to other prognostic mark- ers such as Rai stage, lymphocyte doubling time, serum LDH  or serum B2M level (Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal – Wallis  test for discrete variables; Pearson ’ s correlation test for  continuous variables). Th us, perifosine appears to induce  cytotoxicity in vitro in CLL cells throughout the spectrum of  biologically aggressive or indolent markers. Patient characteristics in CLL perifosine clinical trial  Because of the encouraging results demonstrating that  sub-micromolar concentrations of perifosine induce cyto- toxicity in CLL lymphocytes in vitro , we initiated a phase  II clinical trial to evaluate the effi cacy and toxicity of 50 mg  of perifosine administered orally twice daily for 6 months  in relapsed and/or refractory CLL/SLL. Th is dosing sched- ule was selected based on results from a phase II study of  single agent perifosine in Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia  [6]. Our goal accrual was 30 evaluable patients. However,  we discontinued the study early because of low objective  1070 D. Friedman et al. patients treated with perifosine, four had normal interphase  FISH cytogenetics, one had 13q deletion, two had trisomy  12, one had 11q deletion and eight had 17p deletion (D ö hner  classifi cation). Of 14 patients ’ CLL cells that could be tested  for conventional cytogenetics, 11 had complex and/or addi- tional karyotypic abnormalities not detected by the FISH  assay. Th us, either by clinical history or by molecular prog- nostic markers, patients with CLL enrolled in the perifosine  clinical trial had high-risk and aggressive disease. Safety and dose reductions  All treated patients were evaluated for toxicity. Th e adverse  and serious adverse events are shown in Table II. Th e most  common non-hematologic and non-infectious adverse  events were gastrointestinal, such as nausea (three events),  vomiting (two events), diarrhea (six events) and dehydra- tion (four events, one grade 3). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage  response rates. Of 17 patients evaluated for enrollment, 16  were eligible and were treated between September 2009 and  June 2011, all at the Duke University Medical Center. Patient characteristics are outlined in Table I. ',\n"," 'Th e median  age of patients enrolled on this study was 69.5 (range 62 – 87). Th ese patients were heavily pretreated and had aggressive  disease. For example, all patients were previously treated with  chemo-immunotherapy regimens and had a median of fi ve  prior therapies (range 1 – 10). Nine patients were previously  treated on other clinical trials. Fourteen of the patients on  this study were refractory to prior purine analog based che- motherapy regimens, having not responded or progressed  within 6 months of completion of those therapies. Patients with CLL treated in this clinical trial also had  high-risk molecular prognostic markers.

Perifosine therapy was  associated with metabolic toxicities, such as hyperglycemia  (four events, one grade 3), hyperbilirubinemia (two events,  one grade 3) and hyponatremia (two events, one grade 4). Th ere were 10 episodes of musculoskeletal pain (all grades  1 and 2). ',\n"," 'With regard to hematologic toxicities, 12 patients  began the study with Rai stage 3 or 4 CLL, so baseline anemia  and thrombocytopenia were common. Using iwCLL criteria  to grade hematologic toxicity [10], eight events of grade 1 and  2 anemia occurred, and 16 events of grade 1 and 2 thrombo- cytopenia occurred. Eleven events of neutropenia occurred  (two grade 3 events). Nine episodes of grade 3 or 4 infection  or febrile neutropenia were documented, but there was only  one microbiologically confi rmed infection that began during  perifosine treatment ( Escherichia coli sepsis). Two patients required dose reductions and delays due to  toxicity. One patient developed neutropenia, and perifosine  was held for 1 week then restarted at daily dosing. Another  patient developed anemia and required transfusions, and  perifosine was held for 2 weeks, then restarted at daily  dosing. We noted other eff ects of perifosine. Th ese included an  improvement in thrombocytopenia (isolated from changes  in hemoglobin or leukocyte count) in three patients, rash in  two patients, and reduction in malignant pleural eff usions in  one patient. Patient response to perifosine therapy  At a median follow-up time of 290 days (range 19 – 1142  days), 15 patients had died and one remains alive. As seen  in Figure 2, by 1 year of initiation of the perifosine study, all  treated patients progressed, received subsequent therapy or  died. Median EFS was 119 days (3.9 months), and median OS  was 290 days (9.7 months). Responses are outlined in Table III. Eight patients did  not complete 3 months of therapy. Of the eight patients who  were evaluated at 3 months, six had stable disease, one had  a partial response and one had progression of disease. Only  one patient completed 6 months of therapy, and had stable  disease at the conclusion of therapy. Early discontinuation of  therapy was most often due to insuffi cient response (56%) or  disease progression/transformation (19%). Other clinical trials of novel agents that inhibit the PI3K/ AKT pathway in CLL have noted increasing lymphocyto- sis accompanied by a reduction of lymph node size [18],  thought to be due to redistribution from the lymph node  microenvironment to the blood [19]. ',\n"," 'In six patients, we also  saw a rise in circulating leukocyte count. Th is was accompa- nied by an initial reduction in palpable lymphadenopathy  in four patients, while the remaining two did not have pal- pable lymph nodes at the start of treatment. In one patient,  this initial increase in lymphocytosis was accompanied by  a fever, reduction in serum LDH and resolution of thrombo- cytopenia. By 3 months of therapy, this patient had progres- sion of lymphadenopathy on computed tomography (CT)  scan and a reduction in circulating CLL cells.

',\n"," 'Perifosine in CLL 1073 Discussion  In the phase II trial assessing the effi cacy of perifosine as a  single agent for CLL therapy, we have found that perifosine  mainly stabilizes disease in a heavily pretreated and highly  refractory population of patients with CLL, and that this  eff ect is not associated with in vivo alterations in AKT phos- phorylation of CLL lymphocytes. In our laboratory-based  experiments, we demonstrated that perifosine has cytotoxic  activity against CLL lymphocytes in vitro that is independent  of inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Despite observing in vitro cytotoxicity of CLL cells with  perifosine in the nanomolar range, we did not fi nd signifi - cant in vivo clinical responses. Th is discrepancy could be  due to experimental conditions that may not fully represent  the in vivo setting. For example, when fetal bovine serum  (10%) was added to standard medium, the mean ED  rose  to 11 1.5 μ M (standard error; n 3), implying that protein  binding may diminish perifosine ’ s activity. Notably, the  plasma concentration reached after 1 week of therapy (4042  ng/mL) is equivalent to 8.75 μ M, a lower concentration than  this in vitro ED  result. Even if higher doses are necessary to  induce clinical responses, such an approach has previously  been demonstrated to cause greater toxicities (specifi cally  gastrointestinal and fatigue) [20]. More rapid achievement  of steady state concentrations can be achieved with loading  doses, but are associated with dose-limiting toxicities, espe- cially in the loading period [22]. In the phase II study of peri- fosine in Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia, 43% of patients  required dose reductions from 150 to 100 mg/day due to tox- icities [6]. Th us, known toxicities limited our dosing plan. A high-risk patient population with few treatment options  was treated in the trial. Th e oral administration of therapy and  the low incidence of cytopenias in other perifosine clinical tri- als attracted patients who were older and had more advanced  disease. Notably, most patients achieved disease stabiliza- tion with perifosine after progressing on other highly active  therapeutic regimens and other clinical trials, including fl u- darabine, bendamustine and fl avopiridol. Discontinuation of  We also assessed plasma perifosine concentration at the  specifi ed sample collection time points. ',\n"," 'As seen in Figure  3(D), after 1 week of perifosine treatment, patients reached  the expected plasma concentration for the dose based on  prior phase I studies [20]. Th e median concentration at that  time was 4042 ng/mL. For patients continuing on therapy  with subsequent blood collection, the median perifosine  concentration was 6058 ng/mL. Th ere was no correlation  between plasma perifosine concentration and clinical  responses or adverse events. In vitro cytotoxicity by perifosine is not related  to inhibition of AKT phosphorylation  Given prior reports documenting that perifosine inhibits  AKT phosphorylation and the PI3K/AKT pathway in multiple  myeloma [7], it was unexpected that perifosine treatment did  not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes in the  clinical trial. Th erefore, we performed in vitro experiments  to directly evaluate perifosine-induced suppression of AKT  phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. CLL cells up- regulate signaling via the PI3K/AKT pathway upon stimula- tion of the B-cell receptor by IgM cross-linking [Figure 4(A)]. We evaluated AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells after IgM  cross-linking with no drug compared to that with the addition  of perifosine or LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway  [21]. LY294002 signifi cantly decreased AKT phosphorylation  (pS473) in fi ve CLL samples after IgM cross-linking, whereas  perifosine did not [Figure 4(A)]. We observed no signifi cant  change in AKT phosphorylation with either drug without IgM  cross-linking (paired t -test, data not shown). Despite having  no eff ect on AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells, perifosine did  induce cytotoxicity in these samples tested, with ED  values  ranging from 578 nM to 1.545 μ M. Interestingly, we found that perifosine signifi cantly  increased phosphorylation of MEK in CLL lymphocytes  [Figure 4(B)], similar to fi ndings previously reported in  multiple myeloma cell lines [7]. Th ese fi ndings underscore  the diff erential eff ects of perifosine across diff erent types of  malignant B-cells.  0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Baseline IgM IgM + LY294002 IgM + Perifosine p = 0.042 p = 0.002 (A) (B) Baseline IgM IgM + LY294002 IgM + Perifosine p = 0.018 Figure 4.

Statistical signifi cance is  determined with paired t -test. IgM cross-linking induces phosphorylation of AKT. AKT phosphorylation is signifi cantly abrogated by addition of  LY294002, as expected. However, perifosine does not reduce AKT phosphorylation compared to IgM cross-linking alone. (B) Box and whisker plots  of phosphorylated MEK in primary CLL lymphocytes from fi ve patients under conditions as in IgM cross-linking in CLL cells does not signifi cantly  increase MEK phosphorylation.

However,  adding perifosine to anti-IgM signifi cantly increases MEK phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes compared to IgM cross-linking alone. 1074 D. Friedman et al.

Given  the impressive responses to PI3K-delta isoform inhibitors in  relapsed CLL [18], the limited clinical effi cacy of perifosine  precludes its further development in this setting. Overall, perifosine was well tolerated. Notable non- hematologic and non-infectious toxicities were gastroin- testinal (nausea, diarrhea, dehydration) and pain (mostly  musculoskeletal), which were typically grade 1 or 2 and were  anticipated based on clinical evaluations of perifosine in  other malignancies [8,23]. Th ere was a varied eff ect of peri- fosine on hematologic parameters: in some cases cytopenias  improved dramatically, while in others, profound throm- bocytopenia and anemia requiring transfusions occurred. Fevers and infections did occur, but it is unclear whether  these were due to underlying immunosuppression or a direct  eff ect of perifosine. In one case, fever coincided with initia- tion of perifosine and the improvement of anemia, thrombo- cytopenia and neutropenia, suggesting that it may have been  due to therapy itself, not an infection. Perifosine has been found to have a variety of mecha- nisms of action independent of its eff ect on AKT phospho- rylation [24 – 27]. Th ese include alterations of membrane  lipid rafts and associated death receptors (such as tumor  necrosis factor [TNF]-related apoptosis-inducing ligand  [TRAIL]-receptor 1 and 2), induction of apoptosis via sup- pression of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, inhibition of  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and  induction of autophagy. Other cellular eff ects of perifosine  include induction of the mitogen activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of MEK [7],  which we also noted in our experiments. ',\n"," 'We did not evalu- ate whether these other potential mechanisms explain the  perifosine-induced in vitro cytotoxicity observed in cul- tured CLL cells. Th ese series of experiments, while not yielding a novel  therapeutic agent for CLL, do add to growing opportunities  for ex vivo monitoring of pharmacodynamic endpoints in  leukemia [18,28]. Th rough fl ow cytometry of whole blood,  we could evaluate known surface markers of CLL, as well as  phosphorylation of various members of second messenger  systems, using small numbers of circulating CLL cells. Th is is  important, as patients with CLL may paradoxically develop  lymphopenia with disease progression or after multiple  therapeutic regimens. Th us, in a series of translational experiments to evalu- ate perifosine in CLL, we demonstrated a cytotoxic eff ect in  vitro but only stabilization of disease in vivo . Th e eff ects we  observed were not associated with inhibition of AKT phos- phorylation, a mechanism previously reported for perifos- ine in other B-cell malignancies. Our study highlights the  value of incorporating ex vivo pharmacodynamic monitor- ing during therapy with novel agents for CLL to confi rm  inhibition of the target and/or to identify biomarkers of  therapy response.

Granulocyte  macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was added to  the regimen to determine whether it would improve treatment  effi cacy without increasing toxicity. High risk was defi ned as  at least one of the following: 17p13 - ; 11q22.3 - ; unmutated  IGHV (or use of VH3 – 21) together with elevated expression of  ZAP-70 and/or CD38. ',\n"," 'Treatment was subcutaneous GM-CSF  250 μ g Monday – Wednesday – Friday for 6 weeks from day 1,  subcutaneous alemtuzumab 3 mg – 10 mg – 30 mg from day 3  and then 30 mg Monday – Wednesday – Friday for 4 weeks, and  intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /week) for 4 weeks from day 8. Patients received standard supportive care and were monitored  weekly for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. Using standard  criteria, 31 (94%) patients responded to treatment, with nine  (27%) complete responses (one with persistent cytopenia) and  nine (27%) nodular partial responses. Median progression-free  survival was 13.0 months and time to next treatment was 33.5  months. No patient died during treatment, seven (21%) had  grade 3 – 4 toxicities attributable to treatment, and 10 (30%) had  CMV viremia. Addition of GM-CSF to therapy with alemtuzumab  and rituximab decreased treatment effi cacy and increased the  rate of CMV reactivation compared to a historical control.

Th ose patients in whom interphase fl uores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects 17p13 deletions  (17p - ) or 11q22.3 deletions (11q - ) have a signifi cantly poorer  prognosis [1]. Use of unmutated IGHV ( 2% diff erence from  germline sequence) [2,3] and use of VH3 – 21 irrespective of  mutation status [5] are associated with a poorer prognosis. Patients with unmutated IGHV are reported to have a signifi - cantly worse prognosis if CLL cells express CD38 or ZAP-70  [6,7]. Defi ning high-risk earlier-stage CLL in asymptomatic  patients is now feasible, and the challenge is to develop  highly eff ective low-toxicity therapy for this population. Th e current standard of care is to treat patients with CLL  only when they have progressive disease, because conven- tional treatment is not curative, and previous randomized  studies using only chemotherapy showed no survival advan- tage for early treatment [8 – 10]. Fit patients with progressive  CLL are now usually treated with chemoimmunotherapy  (purine analog, cyclophosphamide and rituximab), which  achieves high response rates, prolonged response duration  and increased overall survival [11 – 13]. ',\n"," 'All patients required an Eastern Coopera- tive Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 – 2 and  adequate organ function (serum creatinine 1.5 upper  limit of normal [UNL], total bilirubin 3.0 UNL and serum  aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 3.0 UNL). Exclusion  criteria included any evidence of active autoimmune disease  or active primary malignancy requiring treatment or limiting  expected survival to 2 years. Therapy  Patients were treated for 6 weeks. GM-CSF 250 μ g/day  was given subcutaneously three times a week (Monday – Wednesday – Friday) starting on day 1 of treatment and con- tinued for a total of 6 weeks. Patients received subcutaneous  alemtuzumab with dose escalation (3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg) on  days 3 – 5 of the fi rst week of therapy as tolerated, and then  received 30 mg/day Monday – Wednesday – Friday for the  next 4 weeks. After the fi rst week of therapy, alemtuzumab  could be self-administered at home at the patient ’ s discre- tion. Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 intravenously) was given on  day 8 and then weekly for a total of four doses. Th e fi rst dose  of alemtuzumab and all doses of rituximab were premedi- cated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Patients  received allopurinol (300 mg/day) on days 2 – 15 of therapy. All  patients received prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia  and reactivation of herpes simplex and varicella zoster dur- ing treatment and then for an additional 6 months. Patients  were monitored for CMV reactivation using polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) for viral DNA weekly during treatment  and then monthly for 6 months, and treated whenever CMV  viremia was detected. Response evaluation  Patients were evaluated by physical examination and blood  testing weekly during treatment, then monthly for 6 months,  and then at 9 and 12 months after completing therapy. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 (http://ctep.cancer. gov/). Response to treatment was measured 2 months after  completion of therapy using standard NCI-WG96 criteria  [27]. ',\n"," 'However, these thera- pies can cause signifi cant toxicity and long-term complica- tions, and are considerably less eff ective in patients with p53  dysfunction [13,14]. Th us, early treatment of selected patients  with CLL with a lower burden of disease and high risk of dis- ease progression using eff ective low-toxicity therapy could  decrease exposure to DNA-damaging agents and the risk of  clonal evolution to more aggressive disease. We have previously reported a phase II trial using a  short course of alemtuzumab and rituximab for early treat- ment of patients with high-risk CLL [15]. Th is regimen was  selected because alemtuzumab and rituximab have discrete  targets and diff erent mechanisms of action [16,17], and the  addition of rituximab to alemtuzumab appears to improve  responses, compared to historical results, for patients with  relapsed/refractory CLL [18,19]. Early treatment of patients  GM-CSF in treatment of CLL 477 with high-risk CLL resulted in a 90% response rate, 37%  complete response (CR) rate, median duration of response  of 14.4 months and estimated median time to next treatment  of 4.4 years [15]. Th erapy was well tolerated, and although  cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in three (10%)  patients, only one patient had clinical disease [15]. However,  because of the limited duration of response, additional eff orts  are required to improve the effi cacy of this therapy. Phagocytosis by fi xed macrophages and antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by natural  killer (NK) cells, monocytes and neutrophils are important  mechanisms of action of both rituximab and alemtuzumab,  and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is important  for the activity of alemtuzumab [16,17,20,21]. Both alemtu- zumab and rituximab decrease the circulating neutrophil  count, and alemtuzumab can decrease circulating NK cells  and monocytes [15], while its eff ect on tissue macrophages  is not known. Th us, both alemtuzumab and rituximab could  inhibit ADCC by decreasing eff ector cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM- CSF) promotes proliferation and maturation of neutrophils  and monocytes, and increases diff erentiation of monocytes  to macrophages and dendritic cells [22]. GM-CSF has also  been reported to increase rituximab ADCC of CLL cells by  monocytes in vitro [23]. ',\n"," 'A phase II study using GM-CSF and  rituximab to treat patients with relapsed follicular B cell lym- phoma reported higher overall response and CR rates without  undue toxicity, compared to the historical experience [24]. In addition, limited experience of treatment of patients with  CLL with GM-CSF and rituximab suggests that this therapy is  well tolerated, and it did not have inferior effi cacy compared  to rituximab monotherapy [25]. Th e current published data  thus suggest that the addition of GM-CSF to monoclonal  antibody (mAb) therapy could be safe and eff ective. We hypothesized that treatment with GM-CSF could  increase eff ector cell activity, resulting in improved effi cacy  of therapy with alemtuzumab and rituximab in patients  with CLL. As the initial step in testing this hypothesis, we  conducted a phase II trial of early treatment of patients with  high-risk CLL with GM-CSF, alemtuzumab and rituximab. Th is study showed that the addition of GM-CSF decreased  treatment effi cacy and resulted in higher rates of CMV  reactivation compared to a historical experience with  alemtuzumab and rituximab alone. Methods and materials  Patient selection  Th e study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional  Review Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT00562328), and all patients provided written informed  consent. Sequential patients were evaluated in the Division  of Hematology at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Department  of Hematology/Oncology at Mayo Clinic Arizona from  January 2008 to February 2010. Eligibility required a diagno- sis of CLL by fl ow cytometry on peripheral blood [26], previ- ously untreated early to intermediate clinical stage disease  (Rai 0 – II) that did not fulfi ll criteria for treatment as defi ned  by the National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria  of 1996 (NCI-WG96) [27], and molecular markers predic- tive of a high risk of disease progression. High-risk disease  was defi ned as at least one of the following: (1) 17p13 - by  FISH analysis; (2) 11q22 - by FISH analysis; (3) unmutated  IGHV ( 2% sequence variation from germline) or use of  the VH3 – 21 gene segment irrespective of mutation status  together with expression of ZAP-70 ( 20% cells positive on  fl ow cytometry) and/or CD38 ( 30% cells positive on fl ow  cytometry) [15]. ',\n"," 'Patients dying without documentation of  disease progression were considered to have had tumor pro- gression at the time of their death, unless there was proof of  sustained response. Time to subsequent therapy was defi ned  as the time from the end of active treatment to the time that  subsequent therapy was initiated. Th e distribution of all  time-to-event endpoints was estimated using the method of  Kaplan – Meier [31]. Baseline information of patients enrolled  in this trial was compared to that of patients enrolled in  MC038G using two-sample t -tests (for continuous data) or χ 2  tests (for categorical data). Results  Th irty-three patients were enrolled and are described in  Table I. All patients met eligibility criteria, completed the  treatment regimen protocol, and were evaluated for response  and toxicity. Th e median follow-up for surviving patients  ( n 31) was 28 months (range 10 – 43). Toxicity  Th ere were no deaths during treatment, and seven (21%)  patients had severe (grade 3 – 4) adverse events at least pos- sibly related to treatment: neutropenia ( n 3), infections  ( n 4), dyspnea ( n 1), hypersensitivity reaction ( n 1)  and skin reactions ( n 2). Th e severe infections were febrile  neutropenia ( n 1), pneumonia ( n 1) and opportunistic  infections ( n 2), which included one patient with CMV  reactivation detailed below. In one of these patients, infec- tion resulted in a short delay in completing treatment. CMV viremia was detected by PCR in the peripheral  blood in 10 (30%) patients, with a median time to detection  of 4 weeks from starting treatment (range 3 – 8) and a median  Table I.

Among the nine  patients who started valganciclovir therapy (900 mg every  12 h by mouth) within 24 h of the detection of viremia, there  were no signifi cant clinical consequences of CMV reactiva- tion. However, one patient had a multiple-day delay in fi lling  her prescription for valganciclovir because of logistical prob- lems, and she developed symptomatic CMV reactivation  requiring hospitalization and ganciclovir therapy. Th ere was  only one grade 2 injection site reaction. Responses to treatment  Th irty-one (94%, 95% confi dence interval [CI]: 80 – 99%)  patients responded to treatment, with eight (24%) CRs, one  complete response with persistent cytopenia (CRi) (with  subsequent normalization of blood counts), nine (27%)  nPRs and 13 (39%) PRs.

',\n"," 'Of the fi rst 30 evaluable patients enrolled there were  eight (27%) CRs, and thus, according to the study design, we  conclude that the addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and  rituximab did not increase the effi cacy of this regimen.

Th e role of treatment  with alemtuzumab in development of the diff use large B-cell  lymphoma cannot be determined. Alemtuzumab-induced  immunosuppression has been associated with the develop- ment of more aggressive lymphomas, but the reported cases  were EBV positive [32,33]. Th e absence of evidence of EBV  reactivation and the temporal sequence of the complica- tion suggest that this patient ’ s diff use large B-cell lymphoma  could have been present prior to initiation of therapy with  alemtuzumab. A second patient with 17p13 – CLL achieved  PR of 4 months ’ duration. He then failed treatment for pro- gressive disease with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide and  rituximab (FCR) and died from his CLL 10 months later. Eleven additional patients required subsequent treatment  and received FCR ( n 6), pentostatin, cyclophosphamide  and rituximab (PCR) ( n 1), bendamustine and rituximab  ( n 1), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and  prednisone ( n 2) and rituximab ( n 1). Neutrophil and monocyte counts  GM-CSF decreased treatment-induced neutropenia (Figure 3)  but not alemtuzumab-mediated monocytopenia (Figure 4),  compared to our previous study of early treatment of patients  with high-risk CLL with alemtuzumab and rituximab [15]. ',\n"," 'Testing for residual disease  BM biopsies of the six patients achieving a CR/CRi with no  morphological evidence of CLL were studied with IHC for  residual disease. Th e three patients with IHC-negative CR  had a longer PFS (not reached at 25 months). Serial high- sensitivity fl ow cytometry for MRD in blood was performed  during treatment and then until disease progression in  29 patients. Seventeen (59%) patients achieved at least one  negative MRD test during treatment, and 12 (41%) had nega- tive results after completion of therapy. However, only four  (14%) of these patients were still MRD-negative at 2 months  after completion of therapy, with two having evidence of resid- ual disease on IHC examination of the BM (PFS 19 months and  not reached at 19 months) and two having an IHC-negative BM  (PFS not reached at 25 months). Th e longest duration of MRD- negative status was 9 months after completion of therapy. Addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and rituximab  To assess whether GM-CSF improved the effi cacy of alemtu- zumab and rituximab for early treatment of high-risk CLL,  we compared the results of this trial (MC0785) to a preced- ing trial (MC038G) that used similar eligibility criteria [15]. As seen in Table II, there were signifi cantly more patients  on the MC0785 trial with unmutated IGHV . In contrast, the  higher number of patients on the MC038G with 17p13 – (30%  vs. 12%) did not represent a signifi cant diff erence ( p 0.12). Use of GM-CSF was associated with a signifi cantly higher  rate of CMV reactivation (30% vs. 3%, p 0.007), but only  one patient in each trial had symptomatic CMV reactivation  requiring hospitalization. Th ere were no other signifi cant  diff erences in toxicities. Use of GM-CSF was associated with  a similar overall response rate (94%, 95% CI: 80 – 99% vs. 90%,  95% CI: 73 – 98%) and PFS (13.0, 95% CI: 9.4 – NR vs. 11.6, 95%  CI: 7.2 – 19.3 months) (Figure 1), but lower CR rates (24%,  95% CI: 11 – 42% vs. 37%, 95% CI: 19 – 56%) and time to next  treatment (33.5, 95% CI: 25.5 – 37.6 vs. 43, 95% CI: 29.4 – 66.3  months) (Figure 2). ',\n"," 'Discussion  Early treatment of high-risk CLL could be benefi cial if the  highest-risk patients could be accurately identifi ed and  treated with safe and eff ective non-genotoxic therapy. this study we showed that the addition of GM-CSF did not  improve the effi cacy of alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy  for early treatment of high-risk CLL and increased the rate of  CMV reactivation. Th e rationale for using GM-CSF was to enhance ADCC by  increasing the effi cacy of monocyte – macrophage – dendritic  cells and preventing mAb-induced neutropenia. Although  neutrophil counts were well maintained, there was no  increase in circulating monocyte counts or treatment effi - cacy. GM-CSF was used at the dose recommended by the  manufacturers based on their experience in vaccine and  immunotherapy trials. A higher GM-CSF dose could have  480 C. Zent et al. Figure 4.

Use of GM-CSF could have adversely altered monocyte – macrophage function in the patients treated in this study. ',\n"," 'Patients with CLL have recently been shown to have increased  levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are media- tors of cancer tolerance [34], and production of monocyte- derived survival factors such as soluble CD14, which have  been shown to increase CLL cell survival in vitro [35]. We have previously shown that patients enrolled in this  study had an increased baseline percentage of immu- nosuppressive CD14 monocytes with reduced human  leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression compared  to healthy controls, and higher percentages of these  CD14 HLA-DR lo/neg cells predicted signifi cantly shorter  PFS [36]. Th ese data suggest that GM-CSF could stimulate an  GM-CSF in treatment of CLL 481 Table II.

',\n"," 'immunosuppressive monocyte – macrophage – dendritic cell  response in patients with CLL that decreases ADCC and thus  impairs the response to alemtuzumab and rituximab. Th e use of GM-CSF could decrease the risk of infection. However, we observed a three-fold increase in the rate of  CMV reactivation compared to the previous trial [15]. Th is  fi nding is compatible with previous reports suggesting that  G-CSF could increase the risk of CMV reactivation in patients  with CLL treated with alemtuzumab [37]. Th e mechanism of  increased risk of CMV activation in patients with CLL treated  with these growth factors is unknown. Compared to patients  on the previous trial (MC038G), patients treated with GM- CSF had a lower rate of grade 3 – 4 neutropenia (9% vs. 17%),  but there was no decrease in grade 3 – 4 infections (12% vs.  6%). Th e addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and rituximab  therapy does not appear to be useful in decreasing the risk of  infection in this patient population. Sensitive assays for residual CLL could be useful in  determining the extent of response to treatment. In this  study, most patients had a negative sensitive fl ow cytometry  assay for MRD in the blood during treatment, but this did  not predict the quality or duration of response to treatment. Our data thus support the previously published fi nding that  MRD testing in the peripheral blood during and for the fi rst  3 months after alemtuzumab therapy is not a reliable method  of determining response to treatment [38]. In contrast,  patients with CR/CRi and negative IHC examinations  for residual CLL cells in the BM had the most durable  responses to treatment. Th ese data support previous reports  that MRD testing in the bone marrow during and within 3  months of completion of therapy is predictive of response  to treatment for regimens using alemtuzumab [38]. How- ever, the small number of patients in our study precludes  any defi nitive conclusions about the clinical utility of these  assays. Th e results of this trial show that the addition of GM-CSF  to the combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab does not  increase the effi cacy of alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy.

Farrell , and Richard Pazdur Abstract On November 1, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved obinutuzumab (GAZYVA; Genentech, Inc.), a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody, for use in combination with chloram- bucilforthetreatmentofpatientswithpreviouslyuntreatedchroniclymphocyticleukemia(CLL).Instage 1 of the trial supporting approval, patients with previously untreated CD20-positive CLL were randomly allocated(2:2:1)toobinutuzumabþchlorambucil(GClb,n¼238),rituximabþchlorambucil(RClb,n¼ 233),orchlorambucilalone(Clb,n¼118).Theprimaryendpointwasprogression-freesurvival(PFS),and secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR). Only the comparison of GClb to Clb was relevant to this approval and is described herein. A clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS with medians of 23.0 and 11.1 months was observed in the GClb and Clb arms, respectively (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11–0.24; P < 0.0001, log-rank test). The ORRs were 75.9% and 32.1% intheGClbandClbarms,respectively,andthecompleteresponserateswere27.8%and0.9%intheGClb andClb arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions ( 10%) reported in the GClb arm were infusion reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pyrexia, cough, and musculoskeletal dis- orders.ObinutuzumabwasthefirstBreakthroughTherapy–designateddrugtoreceiveFDAapproval.Clin Cancer Res; 20(15); 3902–7. 2014 AACR. Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most com- mon leukemia in Western countries (1). It is estimated that there will be 15,720 new cases of CLL and 4,600 deaths because of CLL in 2014 in the United States (2). CLL is predominant in older individuals with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years. CLL has a variable natural historywitha5-yearrelativesurvivalrateofapproximate- ly 82% (3). CLL is characterized by increasing levels of clonal lym- phocytesintheblood,bonemarrow,andlymphatictissues (4). The diagnosis of CLL requires at least 5 109 B lymphocytes/L (5,000/mL) in the peripheral blood and confirmation of clonality by flow cytometry. CLL cells coexpresstheT-cellantigenCD5andB-cellsurfaceantigens CD19, CD20, and CD23 (5). Approved therapies for CLL include chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, alemtuzumab, benda- mustine, ofatumumab, and rituximab. For previously untreated patients with progressive CLL, recommended treatment regimens primarily consist of chemoimmu- notherapies.However,inpatientswithcoexistingmedical conditions, often including the elderly, aggressive treat- ment regimens are poorly tolerated (6). Allogeneic stem- cell transplantation is the only potentially curative treat- ment for CLL (7). ',\n"," \"This report summarizes the FDA review of the Biologics LicenseApplication(BLA)forobinutuzumabusedincom- bination with chlorambucil for the initial therapy of patients with CLL. Chemistry Obinutuzumab is an Fc-glycoengineered humanized anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass with a molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa (8). It recognizes thetypeIIepitopeoftheCD20antigenratherthanthetypeI epitope recognized byrituximab. Obinutuzumab is a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly brown, preservative-free liquid concentrate for i.v. administration and is supplied at a con- centration of 25 mg/mL in 1,000 mg single-use vials.

Toxicology studies were conducted using cynomolgus monkeys. Obinutuzumab binds human and cynomolgus monkeyCD20withsimilaraffinity.Repeat-dosetoxicology studies of up to 26 weeks’ duration using i.v. administra- tion of obinutuzumab or 4 weeks’ duration using s.c. administration were conducted. Toxicities observed from repeat-dose studies were consistent with the intended pharmacology of obinutuzumab or were the apparent resultofcross-speciesimmunogenicityeffects.Theprimary effects of obinutuzumab included hypersensitivity reac- tions and marked decreases in circulating B cells, with corresponding lymphoid tissue B-cell depletion in the spleenandlymphnodes.Transientnaturalkillercellreduc- tions were also observed, as were opportunistic infections secondary to immunosuppression. Administration of obinutuzumab to pregnant monkeys duringgestationwasassociatedwithcompletedepletionof B lymphocytes in infants. Obinutuzumab did not affect embryo–fetaldevelopment,parturition,postnatalsurvival, orthegrowthanddevelopmentofinfants.Obinutuzumab crosses the blood–placental barrier and is secreted in the milk of pregnant monkeys. Because of the depletion of B cells and possible opportunistic infections, use of obinu- tuzumab during pregnancy is not recommended. Clinical Pharmacology The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for obi- nutuzumab were derived using a population-based phar- macokinetic (pop-PK) analysis. The geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution of obinutuzumab is approximately 3.8 L (23%). The elimination of obinutu- zumab is composed of a linear clearance pathway and a time-dependent nonlinear clearance pathway. \",\n"," 'of distribution of obinutuzumab is approximately 3.8 L (23%). The elimination of obinutu- zumab is composed of a linear clearance pathway and a time-dependent nonlinear clearance pathway. As obinu- tuzumab treatment progresses, the impact of the time- dependent pathway diminishes in a manner suggesting target-mediated drug disposition. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal obinutuzumab clearance and half-life are approximately 0.09 (46%) L/day and 28.4 (43%) days, respectively. Bodyweight,diseasetype,andtumorsizewereassociated with changes in obinutuzumab exposures, but the impact ofthesefactorsonobinutuzumabexposuredidnotwarrant a dose modification at this time.

Clinical Trial Design StudyCLL11wasanopen-label,three-arm,randomized, multicenter, two-stage, phase III trial in patients with pre- viously untreated CLL. Randomization was stratified by Binet stage and country/region. The trial was conducted at 155 centers in 24 countries and in collaboration with the German CLL Study Group. In stage 1 of the trial, patients were randomly allocated (2:2:1) to obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil(GClb),rituximabpluschlorambucil(RClb), orchlorambucil(Clb)alone.Instage2,therandomization continued between GClb and RClb (1:1). Stage 2 results were not available at the time of the BLA review. Key eligibility criteria were age of 18 years or older, pre- viouslyuntreateddocumentedCD20-positiveCLLrequiring treatment, and coexisting medical conditions or creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 70 mL/min or both. Exclusion criteria included CrCl < 30 mL/min, active infections, positive hep- atitisB(HBsAgoranti-HBcpositive,patientspositiveforanti- HBc could be included if hepatitis B viral DNA was not detectable)andhepatitisCserology,andimmunizationwith live virus vaccine within 28 days before randomization. Forthepurposeofanalysis,stage1oftheclinicaltrialwas further divided into stages 1a(GClb vs.Clb) and 1b(RClb vs. Clb). In the stage 1a analysis, 356 patients were ran- domlyallocatedtoGClb(n¼238)ortoClb(n¼118).The stage1banalysisisnotrelevanttothisapprovalandwillnot be described further. Patients in the Clb arm with disease progressionduringorwithin6monthsofendoftreatment couldcrossovertoGClb,butonly19%haddonesoatthe time of analysis cutoff date. ThetrialbeganwithpatientsontheGClbarmreceiving obinutuzumab, 1,000 mg by i.v. infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of the first treatment cycle and on the first day of cycles 2 to 6. Later in the trial, because of infusion reactions, the protocol was amended to split the first dose in the first cycle only between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg), and this regimen was administered to 45 (19%) patients. Patients on both arms received chloram- bucil, 0.5 mg/kgorallyon days 1and 15 of a28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. ',\n"," 'After the last treatment, patients were followed until disease progression, next leukemia treatment, and death. Dose modification of obinutuzumab was not allowed. Dose reductions for chlorambucil were allowed, and once reduced the dose could not be reescalated. Patients who experiencedagrade4infusionreactionoragrade3infusion reaction at rechallenge were permanently discontinued from the study treatment, and patients with an infection, grade3or4cytopenia,orgrade2orhighernonhematologic toxicity had their study treatment temporarily interrupted until resolution.

Subsequent premedications could be reduced in the absence of an infusion reaction. Consideration was given to holding antihypertensive agents before and throughout the infusion because infusion reactions sometimes includ- edhypotension.Infusionreactionsweremanagedbyinter- rupting or reducing the infusion rate and administering concomitant medications such as steroids and antihista- mines. Upon resolution of symptoms, the infusion was resumed at one-half the previous rate. Obinutuzumab was tobeadministeredatalocationwithimmediatelyavailable emergency resuscitation equipment. Patientswithahightumorburden(WBC 25 109/Lor bulky lymphadenopathy) were to receive adequate hydra- tion and antihyperuricemics before the initiation of treat- ment for prophylaxis of tumor lysis syndrome. Disease assessment was performed at baseline, after 3 cycles, 28 days after the last trial treatment, 3 months after theendoftreatment,andthenevery3monthsuntil3years fromlasttreatment.Furtherfollow-upvisitswerescheduled every6monthsuntil5years,andthenannuallyfor8years after the last patient entered the trial. A CT scan was per- formed in patients who had achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response 2 to 3 months after end of treat- ment. In patients who had a CR (or cytopenic CR), a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were obtained. A CT scan was alsoperformedwhenprogressionofdiseasewasdetectedby physical examination. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free sur- vival(PFS)basedoninvestigator’sassessment.However,the regulatory decision was based on independent review com- mittee(IRC)–assessedPFS.TheIRCwascomposedofapanel of CLL experts (each patient reviewed by two reviewers and one adjudicator if required) who assessed response and progressionbasedonperipheralbloodcounts,bonemarrow biopsy results, reports of physical examination, and radiol- ogy reports. Secondary efficacy endpoints included best overall response, event-free survival, duration of response, disease-freesurvival,timetonew antileukemictherapy,and overall survival. Response was determined using the NCI/ International Workshop on CLL guideline (5). End of trial was defined as 8 years after the last patient was enrolled. Results Demographics Patientdemographicsanddiseasecharacteristics,includ- ing CLL prognostic factors were balanced at baseline between treatment arms (Table 1). ',\n"," 'The median age was 73 years, 76% of patients had multiple coexisting medical conditions and 68% had a CrCl <70 mL/min. Efficacy The IRC-assessed median PFS was 23.0 months in the GClb arm versus 11.1 months in the Clb arm [Fig. 1 (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11–0.24; P < 0.0001 stratified log-rank test)]. The investigator-assessed median PFS durations were 23.0 months in the GClb arm and 10.9 months in the Clb arm (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09–0.21; P < 0.0001 stratified log-rank test). The results of the secondary end- points were supportive of the primary endpoint; however, there was no multiplicity adjustment plan for testing the secondaryendpoints.Table2liststheresultsoftheprimary andkeysecondaryendpoints.Theoverallsurvival(OS)data were not mature at the analysis cutoff date. The median observationtimewas14.2months,andthemediannumber of treatment cycles was 6. Eighty-one percent and 67% of patientsintheGClbandClbarms,respectively,receivedall 6 treatment cycles. Safety Thesafetydatasetincluded240patientswhoreceivedone ormoredosesofobinutuzumabwithClband116patients who received Clb only. Although Clb dose modifications or delays occurred twice as often in the GClb arm (32% vs. 15%), the median cumulative dose was comparable in the twoarms (370mg vs.384 mg). The mostfrequently reported adverse reactions with an incidence of 5% or greater and occurring at least 2% more frequently in the GClb arm were infusion-related reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pyrexia, cough, leukopenia, and musculoskeletal pains (Table 3). The most common serious adverse reaction was infusion-related reaction (11%). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was more common in the GClb arm (34%) than in the Clb arm (16%). The incidence of infections was not higher in the GClb arm, but 32% of patients in the GClb arm received G-CSF compared with 14% in the Clb arm. Growth factors were allowed for neutropenia per investigator or institutional guidelines. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 4% of patients in the GClb arm. Theincidenceofinfusionreactionswas69%withthefirst infusion of obinutuzumab, and the incidence of reactions with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1,000 mg and <1% thereafter. Symptoms of infusion-related reactionsoccurringingreaterthan20%ofpatientsincluded hypotension, nausea, chills, and pyrexia. Changes to the administration of obinutuzumab during the trial (includ- ingglucocorticoid,analgesic,andantihistaminetreatment, omission of antihypertensive medications in the morning ofthefirstinfusion,andadministrationofthecycle1day1 dose over 2 days) seemed to reduce the incidence of infu- sion reactions. Late-occurring neutropenia ( 28 days after treatment) was seen in 16% of patients on the GClb arm and 12% of patients on the Clb arm.

However, a recent update of study CLL11, including an analysis of stage 2, reported significant improvements inOSforthe GClbarm compared with the Clb arm and in PFS for the GClb arm comparedwiththeRClbarm(10).Thesedatahavenotbeen reviewed by the FDA. The main adverse reactions that occurred in the GClb arm were infusion reactions and myelosuppression. Other important toxicities included in the labeling were the risks of hepatitis B virus reactivation and JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoence- phalopathy, which were observed in patients treated with obinutuzumab in other clinical trials. The FDA review of the randomized trial comparison of GClb to Clb concluded that there was a favorable benefit–risk outcome for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL.

However, this population is notsufficiently enrolledinmostpivotalclinicaltrials(6).IntheCLL11trial, themedianagewas73years,and81%ofthepatientswere aged 65 years or older; thus, this was one of the few randomized trials that adequately represented the typical Table 2.

The results of trial CLL11 indicate that the combination of obinutuzumab þ chlor- ambucil is more effective than chlorambucil alone, has an acceptable safetyprofile, andisanappropriate regimen for elderly patients with previously untreated CLL and comor- bidities. Because aggressive treatments for older patients with comorbidities are poorly tolerated, chlorambucil was considered an acceptable active control for this trial. How- ever, in future trials in this patient population the GClb regimen would be an appropriate control.

Abstract: 250  Body text: 4495  Figures/tables: 6  References: 30  Supplementary figures/tables: 7  Page 4 of 30  Translational relevance  Pinatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22 on B cells and containing  the potent antimicrotubule agent MMAE. In this Phase I study, clinical activity of pinatuzumab  vedotin was observed in heavily pretreated patients with advanced non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (NHL). In addition, evaluating the combination of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab administered at standard doses and schedules was feasible. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of antibody-drug conjugates to deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy to tumors and  further validates CD22 as a target suitable for an antibody-drug conjugate. The safety,  tolerability, and clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab has important implications  for the ability of antibody-drug conjugates to be combined with standard anti-cancer treatment  regimens in B-cell malignancies, and support further clinical investigation of these novel  therapeutic combinations. Page 5 of 30  Abstract  Purpose: Pinatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate with the potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to an anti-CD22 antibody via a protease- cleavable linker. ',\n"," 'This Phase I study determined its recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and  evaluated its safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity alone and with rituximab relapsed/refractory (r/r) non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Experimental Design: Patients received escalating doses of pinatuzumab vedotin every days. Clinical activity at the RP2D alone or with rituximab was evaluated in r/r diffuse large B- cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and r/r indolent NHL (iNHL) patients. Results: Seventy-five patients received single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin. The RP2D was 2.4  mg/kg, based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of Grade 4 neutropenia >7 days in 1/3 patients  and Grade 4 neutropenia <7 days in 2/3 patients treated at 3.2 mg/kg (maximum assessed dose). No DLTs occurred at 2.4 mg/kg. At the RP2D, neutropenia was the most common Grade  ≥3 adverse event. Peripheral neuropathy-related Grade ≥2 adverse events most frequently resulted in treatment discontinuation. Rituximab co-treatment did not impact safety, tolerability,  or pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin. Unconjugated MMAE exposure was much lower  than antibody-conjugated MMAE exposure without accumulation with repeat dosing. At the  RP2D, objective responses were observed in DLBCL (9/25) and iNHL (7/14) patients; 2/8  patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (RP2D) and rituximab had complete responses. CLL  patients showed no objective responses. Conclusions: The RP2D of pinatuzumab vedotin alone and with rituximab was 2.4 mg/kg, which  was well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity in r/r NHL. Page 6 of 30  Introduction  Despite improvements in outcomes of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), many patients experience disease recurrence progression. Such patients have incurable disease requiring repeated courses of treatment, with  survival ranging from less than 1 year for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1) to several  years for indolent NHL (iNHL) (2, 3). Treatments that significantly extend disease-free intervals  and overall survival with minimal treatment-associated toxicity continue to be an unmet need. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) directed against tumor-associated surface antigens provide targeted delivery of chemotherapy, with the goal of improving potency while reducing  systemic cytotoxic effects. CD22 is an accessory molecule that plays a role in B-cell antigen receptor signaling and is  expressed on mature B cells, more than 95% of B-cell NHL, as well as in CLL (4; Genentech,  data on file). The lineage specificity of CD22 makes it an attractive target for antibody-based  therapeutics. ',\n"," 'Epratuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD22, relies on antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for anti-tumor activity, similar to rituximab. It has been  tested clinically, has an acceptable safety profile and single-agent activity in patients with  DLBCL and iNHL (5, 6), and is combinable with standard anti-lymphoma treatment regimens (7). ADCs targeting CD22 internalize upon binding to the target, which is considered essential for ADC activity, and have demonstrated pre-clinical anti-tumor activity (8). Pinatuzumab vedotin  is an ADC consisting of the microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE),  conjugated to an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody via the protease-cleavable peptide linker  maleimidocaproylvaline-citrulline(vc)-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (9–11). MMAE has a mode of  action similar to vincristine, which is commonly used to treat NHL and is the cytotoxic component of the anti-CD30–targeting ADC, brentuximab vedotin, which is approved for the  treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (12). While the  Page 7 of 30  unconjugated antibody of pinatuzumab vedotin demonstrated modest activity against tumor  xenografts in mouse models of NHL suggestive of some level of ADCC and/or complement- dependent cytotoxicity, tumor regression was significantly more pronounced with treatment with  the ADC form (13). Together, these data supported the clinical feasibility of a CD22-directed  ADC for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The goals of this multicenter, open-label phase I study were to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and  preliminary anti-tumor activity of pinatuzumab vedotin in patients with NHL and CLL. Materials and Methods  Study Design and Patients  This Phase I multicenter, open-label study employed a 3+3 dose-escalation design determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Eight centers enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse DLBCL, iNHL (including follicular lymphoma, marginal zone  lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL, and for  whom no suitable therapy of curative intent or higher priority existed. Demonstration of tumor  CD22 expression was not required. ',\n"," 'Eligibility criteria included: age ≥18 years; Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2; measurable disease; adequate end-organ function as assessed by standard laboratory chemistries and hematology tests; no  prior antibody or ADC within 4 weeks; no radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or investigational treatment within two weeks prior to the first dose of pinatuzumab vedotin; no prior allogeneic  stem cell transplant; no autologous stem cell transplant within 100 days of first study treatment  administration; no history of central nervous system lymphoma; Grade ≤1 peripheral neuropathy. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards prior to patient recruitment and  was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Page 8 of 30  Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients signed an informed consent prior enrollment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01209130. Procedures  Pinatuzumab vedotin (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was administered  intravenously over 30–90 minutes in 21-day cycles, with the starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg based  on pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic data of pinatuzumab vedotin in cynomolgus monkeys (Genentech, Inc.; data on file). Patients were monitored during the first cycle for dose- limiting toxicities (DLT) defined as: Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding nausea or  vomiting in the absence of premedication or that could be medically managed; febrile neutropenia; Grade ≥3 neutropenia without recovery by at least one grade/week in the absence  of growth factor support (growth factor support was permitted beyond the first cycle); Grade ≥3  thrombocytopenia without recovery by at least one grade/week in the absence of bleeding, associated with bleeding, or requirement for platelet transfusion. The highest dose where <33%  of a minimum of six patients experienced a DLT was designated as the MTD. The RP2D was  determined on the totality of the data observed in the dose-escalation cohorts, including  pharmacokinetics, DLTs, safety, and tolerability. Decisions regarding dose escalation were not  made until all patients enrolled in the dose-escalation cohort, regardless of number, were  evaluated through the DLT observation period. In the absence of toxicities, intra-patient dose  escalation to the highest cleared dose level was permitted. Indication-specific expansion cohorts (r/r DLBCL and r/r iNHL) were enrolled to further assess the safety and tolerability and to preliminarily assess efficacy of pinatuzumab vedotin at  the RP2D. ',\n"," 'An additional cohort was enrolled to receive pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D  combined with rituximab (375 mg/m ) every 21 days. Study treatment (single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin or pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab) was continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician  decision. Following documented disease progression, patients were followed until resolution or  Page 9 of 30  stabilization of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Patients who discontinued study  treatment for reasons other than progression of disease were followed for response and survival  for up to one year. For patients with treatment-emergent Grade 3–4 non-neuropathic AEs and  Grade 2–3 peripheral sensory neuropathy AEs, treatment delays of up to two weeks were  permitted. Patients were permitted to resume treatment at the end of two weeks upon resolution  of the AE(s). In these cases, patient doses were reduced to a previously established dose level. Rituximab dose modifications were not permitted. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE 2014). Adverse events were coded preferred terms as defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Laboratory monitoring (hematology and serum chemistries) was conducted at least weekly for  the first four cycles, then on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle thereafter. Investigator-based assessments of anti-tumor activity using computed tomography (CT), CT-positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in accordance with standard  response criteria for NHL (14) or CLL (15), were conducted every three months, independently of treatment schedule. The pharmacokinetic profile of pinatuzumab vedotin was characterized by analysis of serum  total antibody (TAb; including conjugated and deconjugated antibody) and rituximab, measured by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Genentech, Inc.; data  on file); and plasma conjugate (antibody-conjugated MMAE [acMMAE]) and unconjugated MMAE as measured by validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (Genentech, Inc.; data on file). Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using non- compartmental analysis (WinNonlin, Version 5.2.1; Pharsight, Princeton, NJ). Anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) were measured in serum by validated ELISA (Genentech, Inc.; data on file)  and further characterized by competitive binding with unconjugated anti-CD22 antibody Page 10 of 30  determine if responses were primarily directed against the antibody or the linker-drug portion of  the ADC. ',\n"," 'Outcomes  The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pinatuzumab vedotin  administered every 21 days in patients with r/r NHL and CLL, determine the MTD and DLTs of  pinatuzumab vedotin, identify an RP2D for pinatuzumab vedotin, and assess the safety and  tolerability of pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab in patients with r/r NHL. Secondary  objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin, determine the  incidence of ATAs, and preliminarily evaluate anti-tumor activity per standard response criteria  (14, 15). Statistical Analysis  Sample-size determinations were not based on explicit power and type I error assumptions, but rather to obtain sufficient safety, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetic data to inform  subsequent clinical testing of pinatuzumab vedotin. Planned enrollment of 30–50 patients during  dose escalation was based upon the assumption that 5–8 cohorts containing 3–6 patients each  would be enrolled, with allowances for patient replacement. An objective response rate (ORR)  ≥30% with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin would be viewed as encouraging. For an ORR  ≥30%, the probability of observing ≥2 responses among 10 patients is ≥85% and the probability  of observing ≥4 responses among 20 patients is ≥89%. Together, the total planned sample size  for escalation and expansion was 80–100 patients. Patients who received any amount of pinatuzumab vedotin were evaluable for safety analyses. Patients with baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline tumor  assessment following pinatuzumab vedotin treatment were evaluable for efficacy analyses. Progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) were analyzed by the Kaplan- Meier method and were defined as the time from the first day of study treatment and response,  respectively, to disease progression or death. In the absence of progressive disease, death, or  Page 11 of 30  loss to follow-up, PFS and DOR were censored for survival analysis at the day of the last tumor  assessment. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results  Patient Enrollment, Treatment, and DLT Determination  Between October 26, 2010 and December 12, 2012, 91 patients were enrolled into the study  (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Table 1). Seventy-five patients were treated with  single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin and 16 patients were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. Patient baseline and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1. ',\n"," 'Thirty-two NHL patients were treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at dose levels  of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.2 mg/kg. One DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia with delayed  recovery was observed among 3 evaluable patients treated at the 3.2-mg/kg dose level. The  other two patients treated at the 3.2-mg/kg dose level experienced Grade 4 neutropenia with  recovery occurring in fewer than seven days. Based on these observations, while 3.2 mg/kg did  not exceed the protocol-defined MTD, no further dose escalation was tested. None of the six  patients treated in the 2.4 mg/kg dose escalation cohort experienced a DLT. Consequently, 2.4  mg/kg every 21 days was designated the RP2D in r/r NHL. Thirty-nine NHL patients were  treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, including 25 with DLBCL and 14  with iNHL (including one patient with transformed follicular lymphoma), with a median of 5  cycles (range 1–19) for DLBCL patients and a median of 5 cycles (range 1–27) for iNHL  patients. A total of 16 patients received pinatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab; five  patients received pinatuzumab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg and 11 received pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4  mg/kg. No DLTs were observed in any patient; two patients who were enrolled to receive pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg were not evaluable for DLT because of clinical disease  Page 12 of 30  progression during the DLT observation period. Patients receiving the combination received a  median of 5.5 cycles (range 1–24). Ten patients with CLL were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin at 1.0, 1.8, and 2.4 mg/kg. DLTs were observed. Because enrollment of CLL patients was terminated by the sponsor, the  MTD was not formally determined. Safety  Treatment-emergent AEs with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin by assigned dose level and  histology and Grade 3–5 treatment-emergent AEs with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin across all dose levels and histologies (NHL and CLL), regardless of attribution to the study drug  by the treating physician, are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Most AEs reported in the 39 NHL patients treated at the RP2D (2.4 mg/kg) were Grade 1–2  in severity (Figure 1). Twenty-seven (69%) patients reported Grade 3–4 adverse events; the  most common in ≥2 patients included neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral sensory neuropathy, hyperglycemia, and anemia. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia was reported in one patient. ',\n"," 'Serious  AEs were reported in 13 (33%) NHL patients. Pyrexia was reported in three patients and  dyspnea in two patients; otherwise, no single serious AE was reported in ≥2 patients. Thirteen  (33%) patients discontinued pinatuzumab vedotin treatment due to an AE. Peripheral neuropathy-related AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 11 patients (peripheral sensory  neuropathy in 7 patients, peripheral motor neuropathy in 2 patients, peripheral sensorimotor  neuropathy and undefined in one patient each); no other AE led to treatment discontinuation >1 patient. Sixteen (41%) patients had at least one dose delay due to an adverse event. Nine  patients had a dose reduction to 1.8 mg/kg: 6 for peripheral neuropathy and 1 each for  neutropenia, pancreatitis, and fatigue. Among the ten patients with CLL who were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin across all  assessed dose levels, three patients had a Grade 3 event, one patient had a Grade 4 event and  one patient had a Grade 5 event of progressive disease. No single Grade 3–5 event was  Page 13 of 30  reported in more than one patient. With the exception of the patient who discontinued due to  Grade 5 progressive disease, no dose reductions or treatment discontinuations for adverse  events were reported. Among the 16 patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (both 1.8 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg dose levels) combined with rituximab, the most common treatment-emergent AEs in ≥4 patients  were fatigue (n = 8), neutropenia (n = 6), diarrhea (n = 5), peripheral sensory neuropathy (n =  5), nausea (n = 4), and constipation (n = 4) (Supplementary Table 2). Ten patients experienced  a Grade 3–4 AE: neutropenia (n = 4), peripheral sensory neuropathy (n = 2) and hyperglycemia (n = 2). Four patients discontinued study treatment for an AE: peripheral sensory neuropathy (n  = 2); increased blood creatinine phosphokinase and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n = 1 each). Five patients had at least one dose delay for AEs and three had a dose reduction for AEs (n = 2  peripheral neuropathy and n = 1 neutropenia). A total of six deaths (DLBCL [n = 4], MCL [n = 1] and CLL [n = 1]) were reported 23–55 days  after the last dose of pinatuzumab vedotin. ',\n"," 'Four deaths were reported following single-agent  pinatuzumab vedotin (progressive disease, n = 3; failure to thrive, n = 1) and two following  pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab due to disease progression. None of the deaths  were attributed to pinatuzumab vedotin by the treating investigator. AEs associated with peripheral neuropathy, as defined by the MedDRA Standardized Query, were reported in 23 of 39 (59%) NHL patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, and in 7 of 16 patients (44%) treated in combination with rituximab, and  were Grade ≤2 in 19 of 23 (83%) and 12 of 16 (75%), respectively. The median time to onset of  the first peripheral neuropathy event was 2.8 months following a median of 2 cycles. The  median time to develop a Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 6.2 months of treatment or a  median of 7 cycles. Fifteen patients discontinued study treatment due to a peripheral neuropathy-related AE. No differences in time-to-onset were observed based on disease histology. The majority of study treatment discontinuations occurred with Grade 2 events at a  Page 14 of 30  median of 7.4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1–10.3 months). Among 33 peripheral neuropathy events that resulted in treatment delays, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuations, complete resolution of the peripheral neuropathy event was reported in 10  (30%). Prior history of peripheral neuropathy and/or prior treatment with vinca alkaloids, which  were reported in 29/91 (32%) and 72/91 (79%) of all treated patients, respectively, were not  associated with a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy resulting from pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment. The incidence of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during pinatuzumab vedotin treatment was generally similar to that among patients who lacked either or both of  these baseline factors (Supplementary Table 3). Pharmacokinetics  Pharmacokinetic parameters for acMMAE, TAb, and unconjugated MMAE in NHL patients are summarized in Table 2. Concentration-time pharmacokinetic profiles are illustrated Supplementary Figure 2. Maximal concentrations (Cmax) for acMMAE and TAb were observed the end of infusion. At the RP2D, mean half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL) values for acMMAE  and TAb were similar, with volumes of distribution for both largely approaching plasma volume. These parameters were not affected by rituximab co-administration. Unconjugated MMAE Cmax  was observed 2–4 days after pinatuzumab vedotin administration (Supplementary Figure 2). ',\n"," 'Unconjugated MMAE Cmax and exposure (AUCinf, area under the concentration-time curve from  time 0 extrapolated to infinity) were much lower than those of acMMAE. At 2.4 mg/kg, there was  approximately a 124–165-fold difference for Cmax and approximately a 42–70-fold difference for  AUCinf between acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE respectively. No unconjugated MMAE  accumulation was observed with repeat dosing. The pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL patients was notable for faster acMMAE and TAb clearance compared to that observed in NHL patients at each corresponding dose level (Supplementary Table 4). Page 15 of 30  For patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin, 1 of 72 ATA-evaluable patients  (1.4%) tested positive for ATAs. For patients treated in combination with rituximab, none of 15  evaluable patients tested positive for ATAs. Together, the overall treatment-emergent ATA  incidence was 1.1% (1 of 87). Characterization by competitive binding indicated that the  antibody response was directed primarily to the antibody portion of pinatuzumab vedotin  (Genentech, data on file). Anti-tumor activity  The median duration of follow-up of all efficacy-evaluable patients across all dose levels was  3.8 months (range 0.07–27.6+ months, IQR 1.4–7.6 months). Objective responses are summarized in Table 3. Tumor reductions were mostly observed at pinatuzumab vedotin doses  ≥1.8 mg/kg (Figure 2). Objective responses at the single-agent RP2D included 5 of 20 (25%)  patients with refractory DLBCL (2 complete responses, 3 partial responses [PR]); 1 PR was  observed among the 6 DLBCL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. Objective responses were observed in 5 of 12 (42%) patients with refractory iNHL  treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin (3 complete responses, 2 PRs) and 1 PR of 3  patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab. In DLBCL patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, the median  PFS was 4.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–5.5 months, IQR 2.1–17 months) (Figure  3A); the median DOR was 3.0 months (95% CI 1 month–not reached, IQR 2.8–13.1 months). iNHL patients (Figure 3B), the median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI 1.3–15.2 months, IQR 6.7– 15.2 months); the median DOR was 4.2 months (95% CI 1.2–20.7 months, IQR 2.8–6.9 months). ',\n"," 'The median PFS for patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab was 5.8  months (95% CI 1.2 months–not reached, IQR 1.3 months–not reached); the median DOR was  not reached (IQR 4.9 months–not reached). In MCL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin  at doses ≥1.8 mg/kg alone or combined with rituximab, the PFS ranged from 0.4–9.2 months. Page 16 of 30  No clear correlations between PFS outcomes and baseline characteristics were identified (Supplementary Table 5). None of the 10 CLL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin achieved an objective response (Table 3). Discussion  Results from this study established pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg every 21 days as the  RP2D in r/r NHL. Neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were the principal treatment-emergent toxicities. Neutropenia was expected based on pre-clinical toxicology observations (Genentech,  Inc.; data on file) and clinical experience with brentuximab vedotin and polatuzumab vedotin,  both of which contain the same linker-MMAE construct as pinatuzumab vedotin (12, 16). Neutropenia mostly manifested as laboratory abnormalities and, in most cases, did not lead to  study treatment discontinuation. Clinical sequelae of neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia  and severe infections, were uncommon. Administration of growth factors in accordance with  published guidelines (17) and increasing the cycle duration to 28 days facilitated neutrophil  count recovery and enabled continued treatment. Peripheral neuropathy is consistent with the mechanism of action of MMAE and is  considered to be an effect of this class of drugs. The frequency and severity of peripheral  neuropathy events observed with pinatuzumab vedotin were generally similar to that observed  in r/r HL patients treated with brentuximab vedotin (18), despite differences in dose (2.4 mg/kg  vs. 1.8 mg/kg), and were similar to that observed with polatuzumab vedotin in r/r NHL (16). Most  events were sensory; however, peripheral motor neuropathy and combined peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy were also observed. Patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy  underwent dose delays until resolution before resuming treatment at a reduced dose, but the full  impact of these measures on peripheral neuropathy reversibility requires further study. While  the majority of patients who were enrolled into the study received prior treatment with neurotoxic  Page 17 of 30  therapies, neither this nor a prior history of peripheral neuropathy was associated with a  substantially increased risk of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy. ',\n"," 'Identifying additional  factors (e.g., age, pre-existing neuropathic conditions, or other co-morbidities that result in a  higher predisposition to peripheral neuropathy with vc-MMAE–based ADCs) and assessing the  relationship between peripheral neuropathy and pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics requires additional study. The pharmacokinetic properties of pinatuzumab vedotin are largely consistent with reports  of other MMAE ADCs (12, 16). The levels of unconjugated MMAE were consistently much lower  than those of the conjugate (acMMAE). The overall pharmacokinetic profile of pinatuzumab vedotin appeared largely driven by the antibody component, given the similarities between total  antibody and conjugate (acMMAE) pharmacokinetics. Response rates, PFS, and DOR with pinatuzumab vedotin treatment in NHL were  encouraging given the heavily pretreated patient population with advanced disease. Anti-tumor  responses were observed at doses ≥1.8 mg/kg, suggesting that patients who require dose  reductions from the RP2D for treatment-emergent toxicity may also receive continued clinical  benefit with longer treatment durations. Interestingly, in five patients, pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment resulted in responses sufficient to enable subsequent allogeneic stem cell  transplantation (data not shown). Additional studies will be required to assess the potential of  pinatuzumab vedotin as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation in previously transplant-ineligible patients. Unlike NHL, there was no early evidence of clinical benefit of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL  patients. Recognizing that treatment-emergent toxicities may differ between NHL and CLL due  to underlying differences in clinical characteristics and natural history, separate pinatuzumab  vedotin dose escalations were conducted for each. Given the decision to terminate enrollment  of CLL patients into the study, the MTD of pinatuzumab vedotin was not determined, and direct  comparison of treatment-emergent safety data between NHL and CLL patients is therefore not  Page 18 of 30  possible. In CLL patients who were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin, no objective responses  were observed. Pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics indicated lower exposure and faster  clearance for TAb and acMMAE in CLL compared to NHL patients, presumably due to the  greater number of circulating B cells in CLL patients, resulting in significant target-mediated  clearance of pinatuzumab vedotin. This profile is similar to what was observed with polatuzumab vedotin treatment in CLL patients (16). Whether this and other factors may have  ultimately affected the anti-tumor activity of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL requires further study. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," 'Overall, the clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin treatment supports the therapeutic potential of ADCs targeting CD22 in patients with B-cell NHL. The risk-benefit profile pinatuzumab vedotin appears distinct from its individual components. For example, the  response rates of 2.4 mg/kg pinatuzumab vedotin in r/r DLBCL (9 of 25 [36%]) and r/r iNHL (7 of  14 [50%]) compare favorably to those of the monoclonal anti-CD22 antibody epratuzumab, which has single-agent objective response rates of 15% in DLBCL (6) and 18% in iNHL (5). addition, the tolerability profile of epratuzumab is similar to that of other unconjugated monoclonal antibodies, without the toxicities (neutropenia or peripheral neuropathy) observed  with pinatuzumab vedotin treatment. Pinatuzumab vedotin also compares favorably vincristine and liposomal vincristine, the latter of which had an objective response rate of 25% in  aggressive NHL and was associated with considerably worse neurotoxicity (29% Grade 3, 3%  Grade 4 vs. 17% Grade 3, no Grade 4 events for pinatuzumab vedotin observed in this study)  (19). Finally, the clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin compares favorably with other ADCs  targeting B-cell antigens (20); the response rate of pinatuzumab vedotin in r/r DLBCL is  comparable with those observed with the CD22-targeted calicheamicin ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin (15%), the CD79b-targeted polatuzumab vedotin (52%), the CD19-targeted maytansinoid ADC SAR3419 (33%), and brentuximab vedotin in CD30+ DLBCL (44%) (16, 21– 23). While anti-tumor activity is generally similar, it is important to note that each ADC has a  distinct toxicity profile based largely on the mechanism of action of the cytotoxic agent:  Page 19 of 30  neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy for pinatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and  brentuximab vedotin, thrombocytopenia for inotuzumab ozogamicin, and ocular toxicities for  SAR3419. Consequently, maximizing the risk-benefit profile of ADCs (e.g., through alternate  doses and schedules to minimize the frequency and severity of peripheral neuropathy) is an  important issue that requires further investigation. To realize the full therapeutic potential of ADCs, it is crucial to demonstrate the ability of  ADCs to combine with or replace agents that constitute current standards of care. In this regard,  demonstrating the combinability of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab is important given the  effectiveness of rituximab-containing regimens in NHL (24, 25). ',\n"," 'Clinical data with other  rituximab-ADC combinations have demonstrated additive clinical activity over either agent  alone; the addition of rituximab to inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in higher objective response  and complete response rates over inotuzumab ozogamicin alone (21, 26). Furthermore, the  ability of combining CD22- and CD20-directed antibodies was demonstrated in a Phase II study  of epratuzumab and rituximab in previously untreated follicular lymphoma, with evidence clinical activity comparable to standard chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy based regimens  (27). Preliminary results in this study suggest that the toxicity profiles between combined  pinatuzumab vedotin and rituximab and single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin are similar. Pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics was unaffected by rituximab co-administration and vice  versa (data not shown). While durable responses with the combination were observed, the  individual contributions of each agent to overall anti-tumor activity could not be determined due  to the small number of patients treated. Further assessment of the pinatuzumab  vedotin/rituximab combination is ongoing in a Phase II randomized study (ROMULUS, NCT01691898) comparing the clinical activity of two MMAE ADCs, pinatuzumab vedotin and  polatuzumab vedotin, each in combination with rituximab. Preliminary results indicate unexpected safety findings and greater clinical activity compared to either ADC alone (28). patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, for example, objective and complete response (CR)  Page 20 of 30  rates of pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab were greater than those of the single- agent pinatuzumab vedotin (ORR, 57% vs. 36%; CR, 24% vs. 16%, for combination vs. single- agent, respectively). Beyond combinations with rituximab early data from ongoing clinical  studies indicate the ability of ADCs, including polatuzumab vedotin and brentuximab vedotin, to  combine with systemic chemotherapy used in current anti-lymphoma immunochemotherapy regimens (29, 30). In summary, results of this Phase I study of pinatuzumab vedotin demonstrate clinical activity of CD22-directed ADCs that warrants further clinical investigation of this class of  molecules in B-cell malignancies. Given the emerging biologic heterogeneity and complexity of  B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, correlative analyses to identify predictive and prognostic  biomarkers will be important to identify patients most likely to benefit from pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment. ',\n"," 'Finally, results from this study further substantiate CD22 as a clinically validated ADC  target and opens up the possibility of developing ADCs targeting CD22 that contain different  classes of cytotoxic agents, ultimately leading to ADC combinations that target multiple B-cell  lineage antigens to deliver multiple cytotoxic agents more effectively than systemic multi-agent  chemotherapy.

Extended analysis of RESONATE-2 was conducted to determine long-term efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A total of 269 patients aged ≥65 years with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia with- out del(17p) were randomized 1:1 to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. Median ibru- tinib treatment duration was 28.5 months. Ibrutinib significantly pro- longed progression-free survival versus chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 15 months; hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001). The 24-month progression-free survival was 89% with ibrutinib (97% and 89% in patients with del[11q] and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, respec- tively). Progression-free survival rates at 24 months were also similar regardless of age (<75 years [88%], ≥75 years [89%]). Overall response rate was 92% (125/136). Rate of complete response increased substan- tially from 7% at 12 months to 18% with extended follow up. Greater quality of life improvements occurred with ibrutinib versuschlorambu- cil in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (P=0.0013). The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were neutrope- nia (12%), anemia (7%), and hypertension (5%). Rate of discontinua- tions due to adverse events was 12%. Results demonstrated that first- line ibrutinib for elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia provides sustained response and progression-free survival benefits over chemotherapy, with depth of response improving over time without new toxicity concerns.

With a median age at diagnosis of 71 years, management of this predominately older population is controversial given that frequent comorbidi- ties often preclude aggressive therapy. Randomized stud- ies have provided disparate results in older compared with younger patients. 2,3 Less intensive approaches, such as chlorambucil, provide limited response durability. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies has improved out- comes achieved with single-agent chlorambucil, adminis- tration of these intravenous agents has associated toxicity, and response durations remain limited. The first-in-class, oral, once-daily, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib targets signaling via the  B-cell receptor cascade, critical to survival of malignant lymphocytes. ',\n"," 'in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Early-phase studies demonstrat- ed responses of up to 84% in previously untreated patients, with complete response (CR) rates of up to 23% and up to 3 years of median follow up. 11,12 This small cohort suggested that single-agent ibrutinib might provide durable efficacy in first-line treatment of patients with CLL while avoiding toxicity inherent to cytotoxic or other infused regimens. RESONATE-2 was an international phase 3 study designed to definitively evaluate first-line ibrutinib treat- ment in older patients who often had baseline frailties against a standard chemotherapeutic agent, chlorambu- cil. Primary results demonstrated an 84% reduction in the risk of death at a median follow up of 18 months for ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil. Based on these findings, ibrutinib received approval in the United States, Europe, and other regions for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL, and allows for treatment without chemotherapy. 14,15  A detailed analysis of overall survival (OS) with longer follow up and adjustment for the impact of treatment crossover was previously reported. A sepa- rate data cut was subsequently performed after this detailed OS analysis to evaluate additional outcomes after long-term follow up. Herein, we present the extended analysis of additional outcomes from RESONATE-2 including quality-of-life (QOL) measures that may help guide appropriate use of ibrutinib for previously untreated patients. Methods Study design and population Eligible patients for RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115/1116; clinicaltri- als.gov identifier 01722487/01724346) had previously untreated CLL or SLL with active disease and were ≥65 years. Patients ≤70 years of age must have had a comorbidity that precluded treatment with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 cells/mm , platelet count ≥50,000/mm , and adequate liver and kidney function. Those with del(17p) CLL were excluded. This study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and approved by the institutional review boards of participating insti- tutions. All patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with oral ibrutinib, 420 mg once daily until disease progression or chlo- rambucil, 0.5 mg/kg (increased up to 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerabil- ity) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. ',\n"," 'Patients from the chlorambucil treatment arm with independent review com- mittee (IRC)-confirmed disease progression were eligible to cross over to second-line treatment with ibrutinib at the investigator’s discretion. End points and assessments End points included progression-free survival (PFS, defined as time from randomization to progression or death, whichever occurs earlier), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), improvement in hematologic variables, patient-reported health- related QOL, and safety. Disease progression and response was determined by investigator. QOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)- Fatigue questionnaires. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameters. Non-hematologic AEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03. Hematologic AEs were graded using International Workshop on CLL criteria. Statistical analyses PFS and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and a 2-sided log-rank test stratified by the randomization factors. Sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust for the impact of crossover on OS as previously described. ORR was analyzed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel c test, stratified by the ran- domization factors. QOL analyses were based on the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful changes in scores from base- line (≥3 points for FACIT-Fatigue). Additional QOL analyses used time-dependent mixed-models repeated measures analysis. Results Patients There were 269 patients randomly assigned to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) monotherapy in the RES- ONATE-2 study (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Patient characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms, as previously reported (Table 1). The median patient age was 73 years on the ibrutinib arm and 72 years on the chlorambucil arm. In the ibrutinib treatment arm, of those evaluated, 22% (29/130) had del(11q), and 48% (58/121) had unmutated IGHV. Patients initiated ibrutinib treat- ment for active disease per iwCLL criteria, most common- ly manifesting as marrow failure (progressive anemia or thrombocytopenia [40%]), progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy (40%) or splenomegaly (26%), with many patients having more than one indication for treat- ment including disease symptoms such as fatigue or night sweats (Table 1). Although 32% of patients had substan- tial fatigue when entering study, only 5% were started on CLL treatment solely for fatigue that was considered to have interfered with work or usual activities. With a medi- an follow up for this extended analysis of 29 months (maximum, 36 months), 107 patients (79%) remain on first-line ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Extended Phase 3 Results From RESONATE-2 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) 1503 Survival outcomes Ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer PFS compared with chlorambucil (median, PFS not reached vs. 15.0 months; Figure 1A). There was an 88% reduction in risk of PFS events (progression or death; hazard ratio [HR], 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001) for patients random- ized to ibrutinib. PFS at 24 months was 89% with ibruti- nib versus34% with chlorambucil. This rate was relatively stable with ibrutinib with an 18-month PFS of 94%. Ibrutinib consistently demonstrated significant improve- ments in PFS for patients in all subgroups including those considered high risk (Figure 2). In patients treated with ibrutinib, only 1 patient with del(11q) has had disease pro- gression, and the rates of 24-month PFS were 97% and 86% for those with or without del(11q), respectively (Figure 1B). No significant difference was observed in the PFS of patients with unmutated versusmutated IGHV (24- month PFS, 90% and 89%, respectively; Figure 1C). PFS benefits were consistent across additional subgroups of patients, including those with advanced disease (Rai stage 3 or 4) or bulky disease (Figure 2). PFS and OS rates were also similar regardless of age (24-month PFS, <75 years [88%], ≥75 years [89%]; OS, <75 years [94%], ≥75 years [96%]; Figure S2). With longer follow up and despite patient crossover, ibrutinib continues to demonstrate an OS benefit compared with chlorambucil (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.86; P=0.0145; Online Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S1), with a 24-month OS of 95% for ibrutinib vs. 84% for chlorambucil (Online Supplementary Figure S3). Responses for ibrutinib-treated patients With a maximum of 36 months of follow up, the ORR with ibrutinib treatment was 92% (Table 2). Eighteen per- cent of patients achieved CR, which improved from 7% at 12 months and 15% at 24 months (Figure 3). Comparable ORR and CR rates were also observed in high-risk sub- groups, including those with del(11q) (ORR, 100%; CR rate, 14%) or unmutated IGHV (ORR, 95%; CR rate, 21%). Disease burden and symptoms The vast majority of ibrutinib-treated patients experi- enced substantial reduction in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly at the time of the primary analysis which was much greater than observed with chlorambucil. ',\n"," '≥50% reduction in the lymph node sum of the product of longest diameter (SPD) occurred in 95% of patients treat- ed with ibrutinib versus40% of those treated with chlo- rambucil, with complete resolution in lymphadenopathy in 42% versus 7%, respectively (Online Supplementary Figure S4A,B). Reduction in splenomegaly by ≥50% occurred in 95% with ibrutinib versus52% with chloram- bucil, with complete resolution in splenomegaly in 56% versus 22%, respectively (Online Supplementary Figure S4C,D). Ibrutinib also resulted in higher rates of improve- ments in disease symptoms including weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, which were indications for therapy in many patients. Patient-reported QOL Greater improvements in QOL occurred with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in FACIT-Fatigue (P=0.0013) by repeated measure analyses (Online Supplementary Figure S5). Clinically meaningful improvements occurred more frequently with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in FACIT- Fatigue, although this was not statistically significant (86/136 [63%] vs.71/133 [53%]; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.92-2.45; P=0.1013). Safety and tolerability of ibrutinib Median treatment duration with ibrutinib was 28.5 months (range, 0.7-35.9 months). Most patients continue ibrutinib treatment, with 83% (112/135) receiving ibruti- nib continuously for durations exceeding 2 years. The most frequent AEs with ibrutinib with extended follow up were similar to the primary report : diarrhea, fatigue, P.M. Barr et al. 1504 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) Table 1.

Grade ≥3 AEs were generally observed more fre- quently during the first 12 months of ibrutinib therapy and generally decreased over time (Figure 4). Rates of grade ≥3 cytopenias decreased over time from 8.1%, 5.9%, and 2.2% during the first year of treatment to 0%, 1%, and 0% during the third year of treatment for neu- tropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Several AEs of clinical interest were characterized in greater detail (Table 3). Diarrhea generally occurred early in treatment (median, 26 days) and was completely reversible in 95% of patients within a median of 6 days. ',\n"," 'Visual disturbances (blurred vision or reduced visual acu- ity) were grade 1 or 2, with 57% of these completely resolving within a median of 37.5 days after onset. Hypertension occurred at a median of 187 days, with improvements reported at a median of 14 days after onset. Arthralgia was observed at a median of 135 days and was generally reversible (78% complete, 4% partial) within a median duration of approximately 3 weeks. Atrial fibrilla- tion was observed throughout treatment follow up, with 4% of patients experiencing a grade 3 event. Symptoms of atrial fibrillation quickly resolved in the majority of patients (57% complete, 7% partial resolution) within a median of 3 days. Nine patients (7%) experienced a major hemorrhage occurring at a median of 310 days. Of these, 3 patients were reported to have active treatment with concomitant medications that impact platelets or coagula- tion (aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, and naprox- en, respectively) including a traumatic hematoma, post- procedural hematoma, and hematuria, all of which were grade 3 in severity and did not result in study drug discon- tinuation. Grade ≥3 infection occurred in 23% of patients at a median of 138 days, including 2 that were fatal (Klebsiellainfection and septic shock). Grade ≥3 infections were observed most frequently in the first year of treat- ment and decreased thereafter (Figure 4).

Serious AEs over the 3 years of follow up occurring in more than 2 ibrutinib-treated patients included pneumo- nia (11; 8%), atrial fibrillation (6; 4%), urinary tract infec- tion (5; 4%), basal cell carcinoma (5; 4%), hyponatremia (5; 4%), pleural effusion (4; 3%), hypertension (3; 2%), and anemia (3; 2%). Eighteen patients (13%) required dose reductions and 16 patients (12%) discontinued first-line ibrutinib because of AEs. AEs leading to discontinuation in more than  1 patient included infection (n=5), hemorrhage (n=3), atri- al fibrillation (n=2), and rash (n=2). ',\n"," 'Treatment-limiting toxicity including both reductions and discontinuations due to AEs decreased over time with ibrutinib (Figure 4). Concomitant medications Concomitant medications were collected throughout the duration of ibrutinib treatment (median, 28.5 months) and chlorambucil (median, 7.1 months). Despite longer follow up recording of the use of these agents in the ibru- tinib arm versus the chlorambucil arm, the rate of neu- trophil growth factor use and platelet and red blood cell transfusion was higher in the chlorambucil arm. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered to 4% of ibrutinib-treated patients versus2% of those randomized to chlorambucil. Anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents were frequently used during study therapy (56% and 54% of patients treated with ibrutinib and chlorambucil, respectively; Online Supplementary Table S3), including anticoagulants in 21% of the ibrutinib-treated patients. Outcomes following ibrutinib discontinuation With up to 3 years follow up, out of 136 patients, only 4 patients discontinued ibrutinib primarily due to disease progression; 1 had unmutated IGHV and none were reported to have del(11q). Two of these 4 patients remain alive. Of the 16 patients who discontinued ibrutinib because of AEs; 13 (81%) are alive with a median of 13 P.M. Barr et al. 1506 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) Figure 2.

Sex months follow up after ibrutinib discontinuation and 3 have died (Online Supplementary Table S4). Ten of the patients had PR as best response, 4 patients discontinued after not responding to ibrutinib and 2 patients discontin- ued prior to response evaluation. Non-responders/non- evaluable had a PFS that ranged from 1.8 to 20.2 months, while responders tended to have a variable but longer PFS (4.2–34.0 months). ',\n"," 'As the vast majority of patients (79%) remain on single-agent ibrutinib, this analysis is limited in size and also to the patients who came off treatment fairly early (9 of the 16 patients who discontinued due to AEs did so in the first year). In total, 7 patients received subse- quent therapy after ibrutinib at a median of 7.6 months following ibrutinib discontinuation (range, 1.2 to  20.8 months), including fludarabine-cyclophosphamide- rituximab (n=3), bendamustine-rituximab (n=2), chloram- bucil (n=1), and radiation (n=1). Six of these 7 patients (86%) remain alive with median follow up of 21 months (range, 9 to 25 months). Discussion This extended analysis of RESONATE-2 with detailed clinical follow up demonstrates that ibrutinib continues to provide significant and sustained clinical benefits, improv- ing the quality of responses, for the first-line treatment of older patients with CLL or SLL with a manageable safety profile over extended durations of treatment. Consistent with the initial report, ibrutinib demonstrates a significant 88% reduction in the risk of PFS events (progression or death) compared with chlorambucil (P<0.0001) with extended follow up. In addition, the OS benefit for ibruti- nib compared with chlorambucil was maintained, despite crossover to treatment with ibrutinib for many patients in the chlorambucil arm (n=55). These data support the use of ibrutinib in the first-line treatment of CLL as a chemotherapy-free option that can be taken continuously, achieving long-term disease control for the majority of patients including those with high risk features. 10,13 Ibrutinib has a category 1 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN ) recommendation as a single- agent first-line treatment for CLL without del(17p) in patients ≥65 years and for relapsed/refractory CLL with- out del(17p). The efficacy of ibrutinib in the first-line setting appears superior to that observed in relapsed or refractory patients. Nearly all patients randomly assigned to ibruti- nib achieved rapid disease reduction, with an ORR of 92% translating to high rates of 24-month PFS and OS of 89% and 95%, respectively, with similar PFS and OS rates seen regardless of age. This observation suggests that ibru- tinib may be most effective when used upfront before the acquisition of poor-risk molecular aberrations, which are selected for with chemotherapy. 20,21 Additionally, sensitiv- ity analyses to adjust for the effects of patients in RES- ONATE-2 who crossed over to ibrutinib found that treat- ment with ibrutinib was still associated with statically sig- nificant OS compared with chlorambucil. ',\n"," 'These results also demonstrate that depth of response substantially increases over time, with higher rates of CR during the extended follow up, indicating a persistent action of the drug rather than a simple maintenance effect. Similar find- ings were observed with long-term follow up of patients enrolled in the phase 2 trial of first-line ibrutinib. Within this previous study, 29% of patients achieved a CR, and 92% remained alive and progression free at 5 years. Given these data, the CR rate will likely continue to increase in the present study as long-term disease control and high tolerability with first-line use can be expected based on the earlier phase 2 results. In addition to the efficacy benefits overall, sustained Extended Phase 3 Results From RESONATE-2 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) 1507 Figure 3. Response rates over time in ibrutinib-treated patients.

No difference in outcome was observed in patients with unmutated IGHVstatus, a traditional poor prognostic indicator for all chemoimmunotherapy regi- mens. Notably the rate of unmutated IGHVin this study of older patients was somewhat lower than other studies at 48% (vs. 58%-62% in CLL ), consistent with prior reports of higher frequency of unmutated IGHV in younger patients. 4,23 For patients with del(11q), another traditionally high-risk subgroup, 100% of the 29 patients responded to treatment with ibrutinib, and there was a 99% reduction in the risk of progression or death, with only 1 del(11q) ibrutinib-treated patient experiencing dis- ease progression after discontinuing therapy for an AE over the extended follow up. While this represents a rela- tively small patient subset (22%), ibrutinib demonstrates a particularly significant benefit in this population, which historically experiences inferior outcomes with traditional chemotherapy or CD20-based regimens. 24-26  Combined analysis of 3 randomized studies not only demonstrated superiority of ibrutinib over traditional chemotherapy and/or anti-CD20 comparators for patients with del(11q), but also equally positive PFS and OS outcomes irrespec- tive of del(11q). These results suggest that current defini- tions of high-risk disease and the impact of prognostic bio- markers may need to be redefined with ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'The mechanism why del(11q) patients may have better out- comes when treated with ibrutinib is of high interest and is the subject of ongoing research. Safety of therapy administered to older patients over the long term is an area that requires close scrutiny. First- line ibrutinib appears to be well tolerated with extended treatment as evidenced by over 80% of this older popula- tion being able to continue treatment for more than 2 P.M.

',\n"," 'This extended follow up allowed for new observa- tions into the timing of when AEs occurred and time to resolution of AEs as well as the use of transfusions and growth factors. Diarrhea, while frequent, often occurred early during the first several months of treatment and was generally low grade and short-lived. Severe and treatment- limiting AE rates decreased over time with extended ibru- tinib treatment. A decrease in myelotoxicity and infec- tious complications over time was also observed. This contrasts with chemoimmunotherapy-associated AEs and was importantly associated with less medical resource uti- lization of neutrophil growth factors and slightly less transfusion need despite 4 times the treatment time with ibrutinib. While the rate of atrial fibrillation increased from 6% in the primary analysis to 10%, overall, ibruti- nib dose reduction or discontinuation due to atrial fibrilla- tion was uncommon and lessened with extended treat- ment in this population of older patients with CLL. Atrial fibrillation therefore appears manageable and does not fre- quently necessitate ibrutinib discontinuation. Additional information on the management and outcomes of atrial fibrillation along with associated anticoagulant therapy has been provided in a large pooled analysis of ibrutinib studies. Rates of major hemorrhage remained low despite half the patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. Previous work demonstrated that QOL is significantly compromised in patients with CLL, affecting physical fit- ness, cognitive function, levels of fatigue, and sleep. Worse scores were reported for patients receiving chemotherapy such as chlorambucil. Even with the addition of contem- porary anti-CD20 agents (obinutuzumab), no significant benefit in QOL has been noted. However, this extended follow up provides the first analysis of QOL, as measured by FACIT Fatigue Scale, following ibrutinib treatment in previously untreated patients. Significantly greater improvements in QOL were observed with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In line with this and the favorable impact on QOL and tolerable safety profile, 79% of patients remained on first-line treatment with ibrutinib at the time of this later analysis with up to 3 years of therapy. Patients who discontinue treatment for CLL including ibrutinib may have varied outcomes dependent on the reason for discontinuation. In 1 study that included most- ly patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, median OS following ibrutinib therapy was 33 months for those who discontinued because of AEs versus 16 months for those who discontinued because of disease progression. ',\n"," 'In our study, the 22 patients who discontinued therapy had a median follow up of 13 months after discontinuation. these 22 patients, 16 are still alive, while 2 of the 4 patients who progressed have died. Seven patients have received subsequent treatment, mostly chemoimmunotherapy (BR, FCR); 6 of those patients are still alive, with a median of 21 months of follow up. While retrospective analyses of real-world data have previously suggested that treatment with an alternate kinase inhibitor is more effective than chemoimmunotherapy following discontinuation of ibru- tinib, 31,32 our data suggests that patients who discontinue ibrutinib can respond to chemoimmunotherapy as sec- ond-line therapy. Continued follow up of patients in the RESONATE-2 trial who have discontinued ibrutinib will provide the needed further data as relatively few patients have progressed or stopped therapy to date. These data confirm that first-line treatment with ibruti- nib results in long-term PFS in patients with CLL and that response quality continues to improve with ibrutinib over time, with substantial increase in patients achieving CR. In addition, rates of grade ≥3 AEs during treatment with ibrutinib decreased over time. The most common reasons for initiating first-line treatment in these patients, includ- ing marrow failure, disease burden, and disease symp- toms, all improved to greater extents in patients treated with ibrutinib versuschemotherapy. Ongoing randomized studies, including ILLUMINATE (clinicaltrials.gov identifier 02264574), comparing ibrutinib-obinutuzumab with chlo- rambucil-obinutuzumab, and A041202 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier 01886872), comparing ibrutinib, ibrutinib-ritux- imab, and rituximab-bendamustine, will continue to define the role of ibrutinib for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL/SLL.

Duvelisib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for relapsed or refractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)andRRfollicularlymphoma (FL) aftertwoor moreprior systemictherapies.Onthebasis oftheactivityof duvelisib,afirst-in-classoraldualinhibitorofphosphoinositide3-kinase-d,-g,inRRiNHLinaphaseIstudy,the safety and efficacy of duvelisib monotherapy was evaluated in iNHL refractory to rituximab and either che- motherapy or radioimmunotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients had measurable iNHL (FL, SLL, or marginal zone B-cell lymphoma) double refractory to rituximab (monotherapy or in combination) and to either chemotherapy or radio- immunotherapy. All were treated with duvelisib 25 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) using the revised International Working Group criteria for malignant lymphoma.

Indolent NHL (iNHL) constitutes approximately one third of NHLs, with follicular lym- phoma (FL), the most common type, accounting for 20% to 30%. Other indolent subtypes include small lymphocyticlymphoma(SLL)andmarginalzoneB-cell lymphoma (MZL, which includes nodal and splenic marginal zone), which account for approximately 7% and4%ofallNHLs,respectively. Thediseasecourse for iNHL is variable, with some patients remaining asymptomatic for extended periods and others re- quiring immediate intervention. ',\n"," 'For more than a decade, combinations of the anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab with alkylator or purine analog-based chemotherapy regimens (ie, chemoimmunotherapy) have been the cornerstone of frontline and relapsed iNHL therapy. 4-8 With such treatment,medianprogression-freesurvival(PFS)and overall survival (OS) for FL are 6 to 8 and 12 to 15 years, respectively. However, the approximately 20% of patients with FL treated with frontline rituximab pluscyclophosphamide,doxorubicin,andprednisone (R-CHOP) who progress within 2 years of initial di- agnosis also have a lower 5-year OS rate (50%) than patients without early progression (90%).

Despiterecentdrugapprovals,alternativetargeted therapies remain the focus of clinical trials that address diseaseresistance,whichreducesoptionsforpatientswith multiple treatment failures. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase whose catalytic subunit has four isoforms: a, b, g, and d. The a- and b-isoforms are widely expressed in many tis- sues; PI3K-g and PI3K-d are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells 12,13 and play predominantly non- overlapping roles in (MZL, which includes nodal and splenic), B-cell survival. Pathways mediated by PI3K-d and PI3K-g are involved in cell growth, migration, dif- ferentiation, and metabolism, all critical to the patho- genesisandprogressionofB-cellmalignancies. 14,15 PI3K- d inhibition targets malignant B-cell proliferation and survival through blockade of tumor cell autonomous and tumor microenvironment (TME)–mediated cytokine re- ceptor signaling, whereas PI3K-g inhibition disrupts the formationoftheTMEby inhibitingT-cellandmacrophage migration and macrophage polarization to a tumor- supporting M2 phenotype. 16-20 The TME is also impor- tant in the development and maintenance of hematologic malignancies, including iNHL. Thus, the cooperation of PI3K-g and PI3K-d in the interplay between tumor cells and the TME, and in the establishment/maintenance of the TME, makes dual inhibition an attractive therapeutic target. Duvelisib, an oral dual inhibitor of PI3K-d and -g, was approvedbytheUSFoodandDrugAdministration(FDA) inSeptember2018fortreatmentofrelapsedorrefractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or SLL after two or more prior therapies and for RR FL after two or morepriorsystemictherapies. ',\n"," 'prior therapies and for RR FL after two or morepriorsystemictherapies. Approvalof25mgtwice daily was supported by phase I findings that plasma exposure at higher doses did not further increase either response rates or markers of PI3K-d inhibition; 25 mg twice daily demonstrated clinical activity and an ac- ceptable safety profile in advanced hematologic malig- nancies in IPI-145-02 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01476657). Inthatstudy,theoverallresponserate (ORR) among 31 patients with RR iNHL treated with duvelisib monotherapy was 58.1%, including six (19.4%) complete responses (CRs). 23,24 Duvelisib’s dual mechanism of PI3K-d,-g inhibition may represent both a therapeutic advantage over selective PI3K-dinhibitors andanew alternativefor treatingB-cell malignancies. With consideration of the need for effec- tive new therapies for chemoimmunotherapy-refractory iNHL, the therapeutic value of duvelisib monotherapy in this high-risk population became the focus of the Duvelisib in Subjects With Refractory Indolent Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma (DYNAMO) study and duvelisib’s FDA approval. PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Design and Treatment DYNAMO was a single-arm, phase II, open-label study of the antitumor activity and safety of oral duvelisib mono- therapy in patients with relapsed iNHL refractory to ritux- imab (ie, no response or disease progression [PD] within 6 months after completion of therapy) and to either che- motherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT). The study was conducted at 56 sites across 12 countries in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Institutional review boards and/or ethics committees approved protocols at all sites. Study conduct followed International Conference on Har- monisationGuidelinesforGoodClinicalPractice,including writteninformedconsentfromallpatientsandrigorousdata monitoring. Oral duvelisib 25 mg twice daily was self-administered continuously in 28-day cycles until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Up to two dose reductions for the same treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were permitted. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpes zoster virus (HZV) was required. The primary end point was ORR assessed by an in- dependentreview committee (IRC) and defined asa CR or partial response (PR) per revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy end points in- cluded duration of response (DOR), PFS, OS, and time to response (TTR). Patient Eligibility Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmedFL,SLL,orMZL(splenic,nodal,andextranodal) andradiologicallymeasurablediseasewithalymphnodeor tumor mass greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in at least one dimension.Patientswithgrade3BFLorclinicalevidenceof transformation to an aggressive lymphoma subtype were excluded.

Response was based on revised IWG response criteria for NHL using consistent imaging: computed to- mography, positron emission tomography/computed to- mography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Safety assessments included physical examinations, elec- trocardiograms, and adverse event (AE) and clinical lab- oratory monitoring. Severity of TEAEs and laboratory abnormalities was graded using the National Cancer In- stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). An independent data monitoring com- mittee reviewed all safety information. After treatment discontinuation,survivaldatawerecollectedevery6months for up to 3 years from treatment initiation. Statistical Methods Using a group sequential design with one interim analysis, 120 patients provided more than 90% power to test the hypothesisofanORRgreaterthanorequalto45%against the null hypothesis of an ORR less than or equal to 30% at a one-sided overall significance level of .025. A P value and a two-sided 95% exact CI for ORR were calculated using the binomial distribution. Best tumor response (CR, PR, stable disease, or PD) was assessed for each patient. PFS was the time from first duvelisib dose to first documentation of PD or any-cause death. DOR was the time from first documentation of best response (CR or PR) to first documentation of PD or any- cause death. OS was the time from first dose to date of death, and TTR was the time from first dose to first doc- umentation of response. The lymph node response rate (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the sum of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions of the target lesion) also was calculated, and time-to-event end points were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

The final analysis was per- formed after the last enrolled patient completed 6 months oftherapy orexperiencedPD; thesedata, with2additional years of follow-up, are presented here, with an analysis cutoff date of May 2018. RESULTS Patient Characteristics From June 2013 to October 2015, 129 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of duvelisib. His- tologic subtypes included FL (83 patients), SLL (28 pa- tients), and MZL (18 patients). Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most patients (68.2%) were male, 89.9% were white, and themedianagewas65years(range,30to90years).Most patients (85%) had advanced-stage (III or IV) iNHL, and 67% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 (94.6%) or 2 (5.4%) at enrollment. Among patientswithFL,87%wereintermediateorhighriskperthe Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. Patients had received a median of three (range, one to 18) priorsystemicanticancerregimens,and52patients(40%) received four or more prior regimens. Nearly two thirds of patients had prior bendamustine (82 patients [64%]). Common prior regimens were rituximab plus bendamus- tine(64patients[50%]),R-CHOP(48patients[37%]),and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide and prednisone (38 patients [30%]). Six patients (5%) had prior autologous stem-cell transplantation. Nearlyallpatientshaddiseaserefractorytorituximabeither aloneorincombination(127patients[98%]),119patients (92%) had disease refractory to an alkylating agent or purine analog, and 117 patients (91%) had disease re- fractory to combination therapy with rituximab and an alkylating agent. Nearly all patients had disease refractory to the most recent regimen (124 patients [96%]), and 95 patients (77%) had disease refractory to two or more reg- imens. Among the 39 patients with FL who received an R-CHOP (or equivalent) chemoimmunotherapy regimen as first therapy, 30 (77%) experienced early relapse (no responseduringtreatmentorPDortimetonexttreatment lessthan2years).Nonotabledifferencesindemographics were observed across lymphoma subtypes. Disposition Of 171 screened patients, 42 were excluded as a result of screen failures, yielding 129 in the full analysis set. of the May 2018 data cutoff, five patients were still on treatment. Of the 124 who discontinued treatment, ap- proximately one half (66 patients [51.2%]) did so because ofPD; one fourth (31 patients [24%]) because of AEs; and the remaining one fourth because of investigator decision, death, patient withdrawal, or noncompliance. As of May 2018, 33 patients (25.6%) remained in the survival follow- up (Appendix Fig A1, online only). Efficacy Medianfollow-uptime(fromfirstdoseuntillastcontactdate or death) was 32.1 months.

No clinically meaningful safety differences were ob- served among lymphoma subtypes (FL, SLL, and MZL). Seventeen deaths (13.2%) occurred on treatment (within 30 days of the last dose of duvelisib). Nine (7%) were attributedtoPD.Oftheremainingeight,three(2.3%)were deemedunrelatedtotreatment:a61-year-oldfemalewith cardiac and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disor- ders died as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest and re- spiratory failure; a 79-year-old patient with ongoing cardiopulmonary disease died as a result of cardiac failure; and a 62-year-old patient with diabetes and car- diopulmonaryandthromboticdiseasediedasaresultofa scrotal phlegmon. ',\n"," 'Five deaths (3.9%) were considered treatment related: a 90-year-old man developed fatal pancolitis, an 82-year-old man experienced a fatal sus- pected viral infection after approximately 8 months of treatment, and an 83-year-old man with baseline grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia experienced fatal septic shock after only 21 days of treatment. The remaining two deaths were from severe skin toxicity as a result of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. However, both events were confounded by concomitant administration of medications associated with severe and fatal drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. One additional treatment-related death as a result of pneumonia occurred approximately 36 days after the last dose of duvelisib. DISCUSSION Although most patients with iNHL initially respond to chemoimmunotherapy and experience long periods of remission, virtually all will eventually progress or develop recurrentdisease. 27,28 Despiteseveralapprovedoptionsfor relapsed iNHL, cumulative toxicities from multiple thera- pies and resistance or transformation to high-grade or aggressive lymphomas remain major challenges. 29,30 With fewpatientseligibleforpotentiallycurativeallogeneicstem- cell transplantation, new therapies are needed. The DYNAMO study evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral duvelisib monotherapy in patients whose disease had become refractory to standard therapies and, therefore, represent the greatest unmet need. Among a heavily pretreated and high-risk iNHL study population, the ORR was 47% (two CRs, 59 PRs), and lymph node disease was reducedin83%ofpatients.Responsesgenerallyoccurred within the first 2 months of therapy and were durable (median DOR, 10 months). The safety profile was similar across lymphoma subtypes andconsistentwiththatobservedinthephaseIIPI-145-02 study. 23,24 AEs were generally low grade and manageable with protocol-specified risk mitigation measures, including dose reductions/interruptions (70% of patients).

Among patients with FL, 27 (33%) experienced early progression (less than 2 years after initial diagnosis) after frontline R-CHOP(orequivalent)therapyandrepresentapopulation with substantially poorer OS. This extent of treatment re- fractoriness and the prevalence of other high-risk clinical features (eg, high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk and elevated lactate dehydrogenase) distinguish a more difficult-to-treat study population. examination of efficacy in the subgroup of patients with FL who received R-CHOP (or the equivalent) as their first therapy and experienced early relapse (as defined in Discussion) showed an ORR of 33%, median DOR of 12.6 months, and median PFS of 8.2 months. With the recent FDA approval of duvelisib, there are now several different treatment options for patients who have received two or more prior therapies: in addition to duve- lisib,thePI3Kinhibitorscopanlisib(intravenousinhibitorof PI3K-a,-d)andidelalisib(oralinhibitorofPI3K-d).Although these three new treatment options are important for both physicians and patients, evaluating them side by side for the treatment of FL is challenging because cross-trial comparisons are undermined by variability in patient se- lection and treatments. For instance, in the phase II CHRONOS-1 study, copanlisib demonstrated an ORR of 59%. Although prior rituximab and alkylator therapy was required, only 56% and 42% of patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab and an alkylating agent, re- spectively. In addition, the AE profile of copanlisib, specifically including hyperglycemic effects mediated through PI3K-a isoform inhibition 33,34 and hypertension, merits consideration before use in an elderly patient populationwithahighprevalenceofthesecomorbidities.In a phase II trial in patients with disease refractory to both rituximab and chemotherapy, idelalisib demonstrated an ORR of 57%. The AE profile was similar to duvelisib, except for a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher ami- notransferase increase with idelalisib (13% v 5.4%). Al- though many new therapies are being investigated for patients with RR indolent lymphoma (lenalidomide and rituximab, cellular therapies, bispecific antibodies, and other small molecules), treatment options beyond the PI3Kinhibitorsarestilllimited.RITrarelyisused,andone of the two FDA-approved therapies was withdrawn from the market for lack of use. The cumulative toxicities and decreasing efficacy of repeating cytotoxic chemotherapy, even combined with a different CD20 antibody like obi- nutuzumab, does not make this an attractive choice either. ',\n"," 'Thecombinationofobinutuzumabandbendamustinewas recentlyapprovedforpatientswithFLwhorelapsedafteror whose disease proved refractory to a rituximab-containing regimen on the basis of the results of the GADOLIN (Efficacy and Safety of Bendamustine Compared With Bendamustine + Obinutuzumab [GA101] in Rituximab- Refractory, Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) study. Given that the bendamustine and rituximab regimen is increasingly used as first-line treatment of FL in the United States, duvelisib monotherapy may offer an alternative for the considerable number of patients whose disease is re- fractory to bendamustine or who are unable to tolerate bendamustine. Patients previously treated with bend- amustine had an ORR of 39% per IRC. Although this was nominally lower than what was seen in patients not pre- viously exposed to bendamustine, it nevertheless suggests that duvelisib has clinical activity for a population not ap- propriate for treatment with bendamustine therapy. Despite recent therapeutic advances, iNHL remains largely incurable, with treatment resistance and cumu- lative toxicity limiting options for many patients.

In view of these attributes, the beta-glucans should be studied for both their therapeutic efficacy in patients with cancer as well as an adjunctive therapy in patients receiving chemotherapy as a maneuver to limit suppression of hematopoiesis. In this study, twenty patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy were given a beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan preparation (MacroForce plus IP6, ImmuDyne, Inc.) and monitored for tolerability and effect on hematopoiesis. Our results lead us to conclude that beta-glucan is well-tolerated in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, may have a beneficial effect on hematopoiesis in these patients and should be studied further, especially in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan is a long chain polymer of glucose from the fungal cell wall which has been shown to have a number of immunomodulatory properties as well as effects on hematopoiesis and as a radiation protectant. It has been well-demonstrated that the beta-glucans increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, synergize with myeloid growth factors to enhance hematopoiesis and mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells in vivo, directly stimulate committed myeloid progenitor cells and improve survival and hematopoietic regeneration in irradiated mice. Furthermore, the beta-glucans have been shown to amplify the phagocytic killing of opsonized tumor cells and combine with monoclonal antibodies to increase their tumoricidal activity. Based on these properties, this study was designed to test the safety of an adjunctive treatment with beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. In addition, because the beta-glucans have been shown to improve hematopoiesis in animals and because chemotherapy generally induces cytopenias in humans, we also sought to determine if the beta-glucan administered in this study exerted an effect on blood counts in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy compared with pretreatment blood counts in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Twenty patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy received the beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan preparation, MacroForce plus IP6 (ImmuDyne, Mount Kisco, NY), one tablet twice a day by mouth after granting informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Group. ',\n"," 'All patients had received at least one course of chemotherapy prior to entering the study, were between 38 and 84 years old and had a performance status of 0 to 2, according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. Patients were monitored every two weeks for side effects and complete blood counts were obtained monthly for six months. Specifically, patients were asked to report any new symptoms not experienced prior to initiation of the study and to note if any prior chemotherapy-related symptoms (e.g. nausea and vomiting) had changed after the intiation of the study. If grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity developed, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1000 uL or a platelet count of less than 50,000 uL, therapy would be withheld until the toxicity resolved. After resolution, dosing would be reduced to one tablet by mouth per day. Mean changes in blood counts during the study were compared to the mean blood counts observed prior to the initiation of the study. The primary endpoint was to determine the tolerability of the treatment and its effect on serial blood counts. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient for publication of this study. Table 1 demonstrates the characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study. Table 2 notes the types of malignancies experienced by these patients and the treatments they were receiving. None of the twenty patients reported any new symptoms while taking the beta-glucan. Sixty per cent of the patients reported a sense of well-being while taking the beta-glucan and asked to remain on the treatment even after the completion of the study. Forty per cent of the patients who experienced fatigue during their chemotherapy treatments prior to entering the study reported feeling less fatigued while taking the beta-glucan. In addition, one patient with lymphoma and significant cervical adenopathy who delayed his standard chemotherapy for 4 weeks during the study and only took the beta-glucan, noted a marked reduction in the size of the nodes while taking the beta-glucan alone. Table 3 shows the comparison of the mean blood counts prior to entering the study with the mean blood counts during the study. As can be seen, in general, there was a trend to improved blood counts during the study as compared with the pre-study period. ',\n"," 'improvement especially of the white blood count during the study period on this dose of beta-glucan. Improvements were also noted in the levels of hemoglobin and the platelet counts. The beta-glucans are long-chain polymers of glucose in beta-(1,3)(1,6) linkages which comprise the fungal cell wall. These glucans have been studied for their ability stimulate hematopoiesis, protect against radiation injury and amplify killing of opsonized tumor cells. It has been shown that these glucans can increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion in several in vivo and in vitro systems. In addition, betafectin PGG-glucan was able to synergize with myeloid growth factors in vivo to enhance hematopoietic recovery and mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells. Treatment with glucans in mice has been shown to increase survival and improve hematopoietic regeneration after irradiation and that the glucans act directly on commited myeloid progenitors to improve hematopoiesis. The effects of glucans on tumor cell killing has included the observation that yeast beta-glucan amplifies phagocytic killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells, combine with monoclonal antibodies to increase tumor cell death and can increase macrophage cytotoxicity to tumor cells by increasing nitrous oxide production. Interestingly, toxicological assessment of a particulate yeast (1,3)-beta-D-glucan in rats revealed no adverse or toxic effects on the animals. The specific aim of this study was to determine the safety and side effect profile of beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy and the effect of the glucan on hemtopoiesis in these patients. Furthermore, because the beta-glucans also have immunomodulatory effects as noted above, we monitored patients for any therapeutic effect of the glucan even though this was an uncontrolled trial and this was not a specific aim of the treatment paradigm. This trial demonstrates that beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan is extremely well-tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. No adverse effects or toxicities were reported by any of the patients when compared to their symptom profile before entering the study. On the contrary, a significant number of patients reported a sense of well-being while taking the glucan, an effect which should be studied further in a larger, controlled trial. There clearly was some amelioration of the blood counts in patients taking the glucan as compared to the pretreatment mean counts. This effect supports the data from animal studies which demonstrates that the beta-glucans improve hematopoiesis through a variety of mechanisms. ',\n"," 'This effect should also be studied in a larger, controlled trial because if confirmed, the beta-glucans could become an important adjunctive treatment in patients receiving chemotherapy to limit the cytopenias observed with these therapies. Lastly, because of the immunomodulatory properties of the glucans, these agents may have direct tumoricidal properties which deserve further investigation in a larger population in a controlled setting. Our anecdotal experience in one patient with lymphoma and enlarged cervical nodes who noted marked improvement on the beta-glucan alone is extremely interesting at the very least. We conclude that beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan can be safely administered to patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy and that this adjunctive therapy may have beneficial effects on the blood counts in these patients. Further studies are warranted in a larger patient population to confirm this latter finding and to determine if the beta-glucans have tumoricidal effects in humans. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

A phase II clinical trial was performed, starting at a dose of 85 mg/day, three times per week. Dose escalation to 110 mg or the addition of rituximab was permitted in patients without a response after 2 or more cycles. MGCD0103 demonstrated pre-clinical activity against CLL cells with a LC50 (concentration lethal to 50%) of 0.23 muM and increased acetylation of the HDAC class I specific target histone H3. Twenty-one patients received a median of 2 cycles of MGCD0103 (range, 0-12). All patients had previously received fludarabine, 33% were fludarabine refractory, and 71% had del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1). No responses according to the National Cancer Institutes 1996 criteria were observed. Three patients received 110 mg and 4 patients received concomitant rituximab, with no improvement in response. Grade 3-4 toxicity consisted of infections, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, and fatigue. HDAC inhibition was observed in 6 out of 9 patients on day 8. Limited activity was observed with single agent MGCD0103 in high risk patients with CLL. Future investigations in CLL should focus on broad HDAC inhibition, combination strategies, and approaches to diminish constitutional symptoms associated with this class of drugs. Historically, loss of tumour suppressor genes and genomic silencing via DNA mutation or deletion have been thought to contribute to tumorigenesis by permitting apoptotic escape, sustained growth, limitless replication, immunological evasion, and metastasis of the malignant cell. However, epigenetic modifications that favour transcriptionally repressive chromatin are also common in neoplastic transformation, particularly in B-cell malignancies. CpG island promoter methylation and post-translational modifications of histone proteins alter chromatin conformation, favouring transcriptional repression and genomic silencing. Eukaryotic DNA is condensed 10,000-fold via the nucleosome, a histone octamer consisting of a histone H3 and H4 tetramer and two histone H2A and H2B dimers. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins including histone acetylation are critical to transcriptional regulation of genes. Histone acetylation and histone deacyetylation regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) leads to either transcriptionally active hyperacetylated chromatin or transcriptionally repressive hypoacetylated chromatin, respectively. ',\n"," 'Four classes of HDACs remove acetyl groups from lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histones in protein repressor and chromatin remodeling complexes including HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8 (class I isotypes located within the nucleus); HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 (class II isotypes which shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus), Sirt 1 to 7 (class III istoypes), and HDAC 11 (class IV isotype). While genomic deletions and mutations irreversibly alter the sequence of a gene, histone modifications can be readily targeted by therapies that inhibit histone deacetylation. In addition to nuclear modification of histone proteins, several of the class II HDAC enzymes can also alter acetylation on cytoplasmic proteins. Given the robust number of proteins targeted by HDAC isotypes, agents that target HDAC enzymes represent a novel target for anti-cancer therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors, including depsipeptide (a potent inhibitor of class I HDAC enzymes), MS-275 (a selective class I HDAC inhibitor), and valproic acid (a non-selective HDAC inhibitor), can alter histone modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lead to selective cytotoxicity of CLL cells. Depsipeptide has led to reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, a dose-dependent increase in acetylation of total histone H4, and inhibition of global HDAC activity. Depsipeptide-induced apoptosis in CLL appears to occur through activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8, with minimal alteration in caspase 9 activity. Therefore, the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide utilizes the tumour necrosis factor-receptor pathway of apoptosis to activate caspase 8, which leads to recruitment of caspase 3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). The observation that depsipeptide operates via a caspase 8-mediated process is significant, as this pathway is not activated by other agents currently used in the treatment of CLL, which more frequently activate the mitochondrial/caspase 9-dependent pathway of apoptosis. MGCD0103 is an orally available, aminophenylbenzamide small molecule HDAC inhibitor that selectively targets class I (HDAC isotypes 1, 2, and 3) and class IV (HDAC isotype 11) enzymes. In pre-clinical testing, intermittent dosing schedules have led to sustained dose-dependent growth inhibition in a variety of human cancer cell lines and implanted tumors in mice. Previously conducted phase I trials of MGCD0103 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and solid tumours have evaluated three times per week dosing schedules with dose levels ranging from 12.5 - 80 mg/m2/day every 21 days. ',\n"," 'schedules with dose levels ranging from 12.5 - 80 mg/m2/day every 21 days. Maximum tolerated doses were 60 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2/day in AML and solid tumours, respectively, with dose-limiting toxicities consisting of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Using fixed MGCD0103 dosing, the recommended phase 2 doses were 110 mg in AML and 85 mg in solid tumours. As a result of the compelling evidence supporting the role of epigenetic silencing in CLL and the feasibility of intermittent dosing in patients with AML and solid tumours, a multi-centre phase II trial of MGCD103 was conducted in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL to determine the overall response rate. In addition, in patients not initially responding to MGCD0103, combination therapy with rituximab and MGCD0103 was explored with the therapeutic rationale that MGCD0103 and rituximab induce apoptosis through different pathways and have non-overlapping toxicities. While HDAC inhibitors induce apoptosis in CLL cells through activation of caspase 8 and 3, rituximab-induced CLL apoptosis occurs through the caspase 9 effector pathway. In addition, declines in Mcl-1 following rituximab therapy may further sensitize CLL cells to MGCD0103 cytotoxicity. Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL, following written informed consent. Leukemic B-cells were negatively selected using RosetteSep reagent (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). Cells were incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin, and 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and immunoblots were performed as described andLC50 (concentration lethal to 50%) was calculated using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Antibodies including acetylated tubulin (Sigma) acetylated H3 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), and GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Patients 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed CLL, relapsed or refractory after at least one prior nucleoside-analog containing therapy (unless nucleoside analogs were contraindicated) and requiring treatment according to National Cancer Institutes (NCI) criteria were enrolled. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, a total bilirubin <= 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <= 2.5 x ULN, and a serum creatinine <= 1.5 x ULN. ',\n"," 'The institutional review boards of all participating centres approved the trial and all patients provided written informed consent as per institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients received MGCD0103 at a starting dose of 85 mg three times per week (TIW) for four weeks. Twenty-eight days defined a cycle. Dose escalation to 110 mg TIW was permitted beginning with cycle 2 in patients who failed to achieve a complete response (CR) and who had no grade 2 or higher adverse events. In patients without evidence of response after dose escalation to 110 mg (unless dose escalation was contra-indicated due to toxicity), rituximab was administered. Rituximab dosing started at 100 mg over 4 h on day 1, followed by 375 mg/m2 days 3, 5, and then three times a week for a maximum of 12 doses. Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Anti-emetic, anti-diarrhoeal, and hematopoietic growth factor support were provided at the discretion of the treating physician. In patients with grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, MGCD0103 was withheld until improvement of the toxicity to <= grade 1. For subsequent cycles, dose reduction by either one (60mg) or two (40mg) dose levels was required for the first and second events, respectively. Dose reduction below 40 mg was not permitted and grade 4 non-hematological toxicity necessitated study removal. In patients with pre-treatment platelet count > 75 x 109/l and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 2.0 x 109/l, the development of grade 4 cytopenias persisting for more than 7 days required cessation of MGCD0103 until hematological recovery defined as >= 75% of baseline or <= grade 1. At resumption of therapy, patients were dose-reduced by one dose level to either 60 or 40 mg of MGCD0103. In patients with baseline pre-treatment platelet counts <= 75 x 109/l or ANC <= 2.0 x 109/l, cytopenias < 75% of baseline led to cessation of MGCD0103 therapy until recovery to >= 75% of baseline or <= grade 1. Treatment resumed at the next lower dose level, but dose reductions below 40 mg required study removal. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and liver function tests were monitored weekly during the first two cycles of therapy and with dose escalation to 110 mg or the addition of rituximab. Starting with cycle 3, blood counts, chemistries, and liver function tests were assessed on days 1 and 15. ',\n"," 'Twelve lead electrocardiograms were performed pre-treatment; prior to dosing, 1- and 2-h post-dose on day 1 of cycles 1-2; and prior to dosing for cycles 3 and beyond. Response was assessed according to the revised NCI Working Group Criteria after every cycle, with bone marrow biopsy repeated to confirm CR or after every 4 cycles of therapy. Hematological and non-hematological toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf). Peripheral blood evaluations of whole cell HDAC enzyme activity and cytokine analysis were assessed pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 8, and at completion of protocol therapy. Bone marrow aspirations were collected pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 8, and at end of study therapy were used to qualify changes in HDAC activity over time. Whole cell HDAC enzyme assays were performed as previously described. Plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from eBioscience San Diego, CA). This study was a multi-institutional single-arm phase II study designed to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) with MGCD0103 in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The study was designed according to Simon\\'s two-stage design, targeting a true response probability of >= 20%, with null hypothesis that the true response rate was < 5 %.\"] The study had a type 1 error rate of 5% and power of 90%. According to the study design, study closure was required if fewer than 2 responses were observed in the first 21 patients. If sufficient responses were observed in stage 1, a total study enrollment of 41 patients was planned, with observation of 5 or more responses considered worthy of further evaluation. CLL cells from untreated patients (n=8) were incubated for 72 hours with or without various concentrations of MGCD0103, and viability was assessed by MTT assay. Under these conditions, the LC50 was 0.23 muM (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.31) relative to time-matched controls. To assess acetylation of known HDAC class I and II targets, CLL patient cells (n=4) were treated with MGCD0103 at several concentrations. Lysates were prepared after a 16-h incubation, prior to the time when cell death is observed by annexin/PI flow cytometry data (data not shown). By immunoblot analysis, MGCD0103 treatment induced acetylation of the HDAC class I substrate histone H3 but not the class II target tubulin (Figure 1). ',\n"," 'These data confirm that at the doses examined, MGCD0103 causes class I HDAC target hyperacetylation followed by cell death. Twenty-one patients completed a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range 0-12). Three patients were dose escalated to 110 mg and 4 patients received rituximab beginning in cycle 4 (range, 2-8 doses) for lack of response to single agent MGCD0103. In the twenty-one patients, the median age was 63 (range, 48-80) years and 20 patients had Rai stage 3-4 disease (Table 1). Most patients were heavily pre-treated, receiving a median of 5 prior therapies (range, 1-13) and 13 (62%) patients failed to respond to the prior treatment regimen. No patients were previously transplanted. All 21 patients had received fludarabine, and seven (33%) patients failed to respond to their last fludarabine-containing regimen. The majority of patients had adverse cytogenetics, with 15 (71%) patients with either del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1), and 3 patients with both deletion 11q and 17p (Table 1). In the cohort of 21 patients, there were no complete or partial responses. Twenty patients had stable disease, and no improvement in response occurred with either MGCD0103 dose escalation or the addition of rituximab. Median pre- and post-treatment white blood cell, absolute lymphocyte, and platelet counts were 30.6 x 109/l and 34 x 109/l (white blood cells); 27.5 x 109/l and 31.3 x 109/l (absolute lymphocyte count); and 49 x 109/l and 38 x 109/l) (platelets), respectively. Four patients who received 5, 2, 2, and 1 cycles of MGCD0103 had 73.4%, 36.7%, 93.9%, and 55.4% declines, respectively, in absolute lymphocyte counts. All of these patients stopped therapy due to toxicity including infection, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. In addition, four patients with stable disease were also able to continue MGCD0103 for 5, 7, 9 and 12 cycles, respectively. Fifty-nine MGCD0103 cycles were completed. Six patients required dose reduction by one dose level to 60 mg three times a week, 1 patient required two dose reductions to 40 mg three times a week, and 16 patients had dosing delays primarily due to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), fatigue, anorexia, infections, or thrombocytopenia. There were no treatment-related deaths. Grade 3-4 hematological events included thrombocytopenia (29%), anemia (29%), and neutropenia (5%, Table 2). Non-hematological grade 3 or 4 adverse events were uncommon (Table 2), with infection (39%), febrile neutropenia (20%), diarrhoea (10%), fatigue (10%), and abdominal pain (5%) occurring most frequently. ',\n"," 'The majority of the grade 1-2 adverse events were also gastrointestinal, constitutional, or infectious, including diarrhoea (n=16), nausea (n=16), non-neutropenic infections (n=13), anorexia (n=10), vomiting (n=7), rash (n=10), fatigue (n=7), abdominal pain (n=6), weight loss (n=5), headache (n=5), and oedema (n=5). With respect to cardiac complications, no evidence of QT prolongation was observed. Only three patients experienced cardiac events. One patient, with a history of pulmonary hypertension that was probably secondary to bronchiectasis, developed grade 3 right ventricular failure with pleural effusions and oedema that was thought to be related to the pre-existing pulmonary disease. A second patient with a history of hypertension developed a grade 1 asymptomatic pericardial effusion on echocardiogram that resolved after discontinuation of the study drug and a third patient developed grade 2 ventricular tachycardia and grade 2 bradycardia in the setting of grade 4 influenza and bacterial meningitis. Infections were common, with 2 deaths attributed to pneumonia. Reported grade 3-5 infections were febrile neutropenia (n=4), pneumonia (n=3), influenza (n=2), meningitis (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), and methicillin-resistant Stapholoccocus epidermidis bacteremia (n=1). Grade 1-2 infections included pneumonia (n=3), urinary tract infections (n=3), sinusitis (n=2), otitis externa (n=1), oral candidasis (n=1), orchitis/epididymitis (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), and folliculitis (n=1). Bone marrow basal HDAC activity levels were comparable to those in peripheral white blood cells in the same patients (Table 3). The mean change in HDAC enzyme inhibition in 9 patients with pre-treatment and post-treatment (day 8) samples available was 24.5% (range -5.5% to 51.5%, Figure 2). In 6 of these 9 patients, HDAC inhibition greater than 20% was observed relative to pre-treatment values (Figure 2). In 21 patients, pre-treatment IL-6 plasma levels varied (ranging from < 1ng/l to 155.8 ng/l). IL-6 levels failed to correlate with fatigue; however, in 5 of 6 patients with grades 3-4 fever, IL-6 levels were increased 10-fold compared to pre-treatment levels. Preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors in CLL in vitro has been published by several groups. In a clinical trial with depsipeptide, a class I specific HDAC inhibitor, modest evidence of clinical efficacy was demonstrated, but problematic fatigue and cardiac toxicity has limited its further development. Due to this toxicity, alternative class I HDAC inhibitors, including MGCD0103, are under evaluation in CLL. In the current study, pre-clinical activity in CLL cells was demonstrated, with loss of tumor cell viability and hyperacetylation of histone H3 after MGCD0103 exposure. ',\n"," 'This pre-clinical efficacy justified the pursuit of the herein described multi-center phase II trial of MGCD0103 in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. Unfortunately in this phase II trial, limited single agent efficacy was observed, with stable disease in 20 of 21 patients after 0-12 cycles of MGCD0103. Prolonged administration for 5 or more cycles, dose escalation to 110 mg, and the addition of rituximab failed to improve MGCD0103\\'s activity.\"] Collectively, this study, together with the previous trial of the more potent class I HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide, suggests that alternative strategies using HDAC inhibitors in patients with CLL will be required including pursuit of non-selective or broad HDAC isotype inhibition or combination strategies based upon pre-clinical synergy studies with other novel targeted therapies. Although four patients did demonstrate reductions lymphocyte count that could be construed as clinical benefit, constitutional symptoms associated with MGCD0103 were significant and frequently led to cessation of therapy. Despite the prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-life of MGCD0103 when compared to other HDAC inhibitors, which permits three times a week rather than daily oral dosing, dose escalation and re-treatment with MGCD0103 in this trial were often prohibited by these side effects including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, and severe fatigue. Such toxicities are similarly found with other class I HDAC inhibitors including depsipeptide in patients with CLL and in previous MGCD0103 phase I and II trials in AML, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumours. In these trials, maximal or sustained HDAC inhibition with optimal steady state dose levels may not have been achievable due to toxicity, suggesting that alternative prolonged dosing schedules of HDAC inhibitors may enhance the clinical activity and HDAC enzyme inhibition with these agents in patients with CLL. In the current trial, the majority of patients could only tolerate up to 2 cycles of MGCD0103; however, four patients remained on study for 5-12 cycles, with no additional efficacy observed despite prolonged dosing in these 4 patients. In pharmacodynamic evaluations in patient-derived peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells in 6 of 9 patients with available samples on this trial, greater than 20% inhibition of HDAC activity was observed. It remains unclear if the 20% threshold is sufficient for therapeutic efficacy and further evaluation is warranted. ',\n"," 'Therefore, despite intermittent three times a week dosing of MGCD0103 that permitted several patients to remain on study for 5 or more cycles and preliminary evidence of HDAC inhibition, efficacy with this agent was limited in CLL, suggesting that either combination strategies with class I HDAC inhibitors or use of non-selective HDAC inhibitors may be necessary to fully appreciate the benefit of this class of agents in patients with relapsed CLL. Additionally, efforts to understand and effectively eliminate the constitutional symptoms observed with class I specific HDAC inhibitors in CLL will be important for prolonged therapy to be feasible. The lack of response with MGCD0103 as a single agent in CLL raises the question of how to continue development of HDAC inhibitors in CLL. Combination strategies with HDAC inhibitors are currently in development in other hematological malignancies including combinations of HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, cell cycle regulatory agents (i.e. flavopiridol), anti-apoptotic agents, bortezomib, and conventional chemotherapeutic agents. These combination strategies may synergize with respect to inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity, ultimately permitting the use of less frequent and smaller doses of HDAC inhibitors which may not only improve the clinical efficacy of these agents but also limit cumulative toxicity. While consideration of HDAC inhibitor combinations with flavopiridol are reasonable given the clinical activity of this agent in CLL, alternative agents, such as bortezomib or the hypomethylating agent decitabine, are less attractive due to the lack of single agent activity. In a subset of patients on this trial, the addition of rituximab to MGCD0103 was well tolerated, and this may also be incorporated into future combination approaches. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

',\n"," 'Based on the hypothesis that bortezomib may potentiate fludarabine activity by inhibiting DNA repair, we designed a phase I trial using this combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory indolent and mantle cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes included 12 patients with follicular, 4 with marginal zone, 3 with lymphoplasmacytic, 3 with mantle cell and 2 with small lymphocytic / chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fludarabine and bortezomib were escalated in cohorts of 3 patients. Rituximab was added to the maximum tolerated dose of fludarabine and bortezomib and added significant dose-limiting myelosuppression. The maximum tolerated dose was fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11, with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 administered every 21 days. Clinical responses were observed in 11 patients, 5 of whom were refractory to their most recent treatment regimen. Six additional patients had stable disease for a median of 10 months (range 4-30+). Cumulative myelosuppression and neuropathy was observed. Fludarabine, bortezomib, and rituximab appears to be an active regimen with manageable toxicity for relapsed NHL. The indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) traditionally include follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic and small lymphocytic histological subtypes. They are defined by their chemosensitive nature and slowly progressive course. Despite a wide variety of treatment options, most patients ultimately succumb to their disease. In comparison, mantle cell lymphoma is considerably more aggressive than the indolent NHLs and less responsive to currently available therapy. As new treatment options with novel targets and non-overlapping toxicities are developed, the armamentarium of effective salvage therapies is steadily increasing. However, the most effective and least toxic of these regimens has yet to be defined. Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid that is a specific and selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. It is the first of the proteasome inhibitors to be used clinically and has demonstrated considerable efficacy in the treatment of indolent and mantle cell NHL. This data led to the FDA approval of bortezomib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib affects malignant cells through multiple mechanisms including the regulation of proteins involved in cell cycle progression (p21, p27), oncogenesis (p53, IkB) and apoptosis (Bcl-2, cIAP, XIAP, Bax). In addition, bortezomib may act by inhibiting DNA repair kinases (DNA-PKcs, ATM). ',\n"," 'Further, pre-clinical data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may serve as a regulator for DNA damage repair, supporting the use of bortezomib in combination with cytotoxic agents. Fludarabine is a potent cytotoxic agent which acts by inhibiting DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, thus terminating DNA strand replication. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line models, synergistic cytotoxicity has been observed with the combination of fludarabine and bortezomib. Bortezomib may inhibit repair of the fludarabine induced DNA lesions, thereby enhancing its anti-neoplastic effect. Other potential synergistic mechanisms include down-regulation of XIAP and up-regulation of Bid, resulting in enhanced apoptosis. In vitro data suggest that down-regulation of the NF-kB pathway, a known result of proteasome inhibition, may reverse fludarabine resistance. Rituximab in combination with bortezomib, appears to be well tolerated given non-overlapping toxicities. Further, synergistic apoptosis has been observed pre-clinically when bortezomib was added to a rituximab-containing combination. We therefore initiated a phase I study of fludarabine, bortezomib and rituximab in relapsed and refractory indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma. This phase I trial was designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of bortezomib in combination with rituximab and fludarabine. Secondary objectives included overall response and clinical benefit rates. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and written informed consent was obtained before enrollment. Patients 18 years of age or older with a confirmed indolent NHL (including grade 1 or 2 follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic and small lymphocytic / chronic lymphocytic leukemia) who had relapsed or had been refractory (defined as no response, or progression within 6 months of completing therapy) to at least 1 standard therapy were candidates for this study. Also included were patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, aside from those with the blastic variant. Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and to have measurable disease. Baseline laboratory parameters included an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/muL, platelets >= 75,000/muL, and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients were excluded for the following conditions: radiation, chemotherapy, or monoclonal antibody therapy within the previous 4 weeks or radioimmunotherapy within the previous 3 months; previous bortezomib therapy; a history of uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension; grade 2 or higher neuropathy; prior allogeneic transplant; CNS lymphoma; serious infection including HIV disease; pregnancy or breast feeding. ',\n"," \"of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI as a sterile, lyophilized powder in vials with mannitol, which was reconstituted with normal saline to a drug concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was administered by intravenous push over 5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 followed by a 10 days rest period. Fludarabine was handled as directed by the package insert and material safety data sheet and administered at 25 mg/m2 intravenously as a 30 minute infusion daily for 3 or 5 days of each 21 day cycle. Rituximab was handled as directed by the package insert and material safety data sheet and administered at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle per a standardized infusion protocol. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or to a maximum of 8 cycles. Hematopoetic growth factors were not allowed during cycle one and were administered at the treating physician's discretion thereafter. Dose escalation is depicted in Table 1. Cohorts of 3-6 patients were treated at each dose level. For dose escalation to proceed, 3 patients had to complete cycle 1 without a DLT. If one DLT was observed, then an additional 3 patients were accrued, and further escalation occurred if no additional DLTs were seen. If DLT was observed in 2 of 3-6 patients enrolled at a specific dose level during cycle 1, that step was considered the dose-limiting level. A total of 6 patients were treated at the dose below the DLT level, thus establishing the MTD. Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. DLT was defined as any grade 3 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity and grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurring within the first cycle. Grade 4 lymphopenia and anemia were not considered DLTs. The MTD was defined as one dose level below the level determined to be the DLT. Assessment of response was performed after every 2 cycles of treatment. Response was defined using the International Workshop NHL criteria. For patients with CLL, the National Cancer Institute working group guidelines were used to determine a response. Time to disease progression was calculated as the number of months from the initiation of therapy to the first documentation of disease progression, death regardless of cause or change in therapy, whichever occurred first. Twenty-four patients were enrolled onto the study between July 2003 and July 2008. \",\n"," 'Patient characteristics are listed in Table 2. The mean age was 62 (range, 36-87) years and 13 patients were >60 years old. All patients were assessable for toxicity. Patients received an average of 3.5 cycles (range, 1-8) and 20 patients who received 2 or more cycles were assessable for clinical response. The mean number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range, 1-7). Twenty-three patients had previously received rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan, 8 patients had previously received fludarabine. Twelve patients were refractory to their most recent treatment. Of these, 10 patients were refractory to rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan and 2 to fludarabine. Five patients had failed an autologous stem cell transplant. Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities are depicted in Tables 3 and 4. No DLTs were observed on dose steps 1 through 4. With the addition of rituximab at dose level 5, 2 patients experienced DLTs including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient as well as neutropenia and neuropathy in another. After independent review and consultation with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, dose steps 5a and 5b were added in which doses of fludarabine and bortezomib were attenuated. Nine additional patients were treated, 3 at level 5a and 6 at 5b. One additional DLT, grade 3 dyspnea, was observed at the dose 5b. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity, with neutropenia being dose limiting. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 24% and 17% of cycles respectively and appeared to be cumulative in nature. Six patients received filgrastim or pegylated filgrastim support after demonstrating prolonged neutropenia during the first cycle of therapy, 4 of whom were treated on rituximab containing dose levels. Five patients were removed from the study due to prolonged myelosuppression, preventing initiation of the subsequent cycle within the protocol specified 5 week time period. As expected, all patients developed grade 3/4 lymphopenia. The major non-hematologic toxicities were neurologic and infectious in etiology. The peripheral neuropathy was predominately sensory in nature, more prone to develop in patients with previous sensory neuropathies and appeared cumulative as well. Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy developed in 9 patients, 6 of which had received prior vincristine. This contributed to the decision to discontinue protocol treatment in 6 cases. It was partially reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. One patient treated at dose level 5 experienced an increase in his pre-existing grade 1 peripheral neuropathy to grade 3 during cycle 1. ',\n"," \"This decreased to baseline with a dose reduction of bortezomib. Two additional patients experienced grade 3 orthostatic hypotension possibly due to drug-induced autonomic neuropathy. Both patients' symptoms resolved with therapy cessation. The overall incidence of grade 3 infection was 6% (5 of 86 cycles). These included 1 oropharyngeal infection, 1 cellulitis, 1 periodontal abscess and 2 episodes of culture negative neutropenic fever. In two instances, patients were removed from the trial following a >5 week period without initiation of the next course of treatment. Other grade 3 toxicites included grade 3 dyspnea potentially related to bortezomib in a patient treated at dose level 5b, grade 3 diarrhea in 2 patients, and one episode each of fatigue, hypoglycemia, and an infusion related rituximab reaction. One patient experienced grade 3 pain related to progressive disease, not believed to be neurologic in etiology. The only grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities included 5 episodes of hyperglycemia, all occurring in a single patient with diabetes mellitus after receiving glucocorticoids as part of her anti-emetic regime. Dose modifications or delays in therapy occurred in 34 of the 86 cycles (40%). Bortezomib was dose reduced in 16 cycles and individual doses were held 26 times for a delivered dose intensity of 88%. In addition, there were a total of 17 weekly delays in therapy. The most common reasons for interruptions in therapy were neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (55% of cases) as well as peripheral neuropathy (32%). Objective responses were observed in 11 patients (Table 5 and 6) for an overall response rate of 45% (95% CI: 0.28 - 0.65) with a clinical benefit rate (complete remissions + partial remissions + stable disease) of 71% (17/24) with 95% CI: 0.51 - 0.86. Two of the 3 patients achieving a complete response have no signs of relapsed disease at 1 and 3 years respectively despite both having been heavily pre-treated including receiving high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Six of the responding patients went on to receive additional therapy. One patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem transplantation and another patient received an umbilical cord blood transplant. Both remain in remission for >5 years. Two patients received additional immunochemotherapy, including fludarabine rituximab and rituximab EPOCH respectively, and 2 patients received further rituximab given in maintenance fashion. Six patients were classified as having stable disease with a median time of 10 months (range 4-30+). \",\n"," 'Of the 12 patients with disease refractory to their most recent regimen, 1 complete response, 4 partial responses, and 3 patients with stable disease (of 4, 5, and 6 months respectively) were observed. Proteasome inhibition affects a variety of cell-signaling pathways via inhibition of proteolysis. Among its pro-apoptotic effects, bortezomib may increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy through the inhibition of DNA repair. Induction of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity, resulting in activation of caspase-3, led to cleavage of the DNA repair enzymes DNA-PKcs and ATM. Further, clinical and laboratory investigations have demonstrated bortezomib to sensitize lymphoma and multiple myeloma cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, reversing drug resistance in some cases. Based on the previously demonstrated efficacy of bortezomib in indolent and mantle cell NHL as well as the potential for bortezomib to inhibit repair of fludarabine-induced DNA strand breaks, we conducted this phase I study in NHL patients with relapsed or refractory disease and determined the MTD to be fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1. The addition of rituximab added significantly to the myelotoxicity of this regimen. Rituximab related neutropenia is a rare complication associated with single agent use and may occur months after administration. Delayed onset neutropenia is also well described when administered is conjunction with chemotherapy and appears to correlate with the intensity of the regimen. In addition, its ability to potentiate the mid-cycle chemotherapy related granulocytopenia has been observed in randomized clinical trials with CHOP and fludarabine based regimens, a finding that did not translate into increased infectious complications. In our study, the patients treated at dose level 5 developed grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in 8 of 11 cycles of therapy. The severe myelosuppression occurred more often and earlier in the treatment course compared to patients treated at the identical doses of fludarabine and bortezomib without rituximab. This potentiation of granulocytopenia may be related more to an undetermined interaction of rituximab with fludarabine than with bortezomib given the similar myelosuppression between dose levels 5a and 5b. However, it is possible that rituximab may have potentiated bortezomib-related thrombocytopenia, a common toxicity of the proteasome inhibitor that has not been otherwise observed with only fludarabine and rituximab. However, further investigation to validate these observations is needed given the small numbers treated at each dose level. ',\n"," 'Hematologic toxicity also appeared related to prior therapy. Patients who had dose intensive treatment or a greater number of prior regimens containing cytotoxic agents appeared to have a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity. This was more pronounced at higher dose levels. As such, this regimen may not be ideal for patients with poor bone marrow reserve, such as those who have undergone previous stem cell transplantation. Neuropathy resulted in 11 dosing adjustments or delays and resulted in a DLT in one patient. All 3 episodes of grade 3 neuropathy occurred at dose levels where 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib was used. While the effects were reversible, this complication is predictable with the combination of fludarabine and bortezomib. Patients with pre-existing peripheral or autonomic neuropathy as well as those with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be monitored closely. However, treatment is feasible as the symptoms typically improve after therapy discontinuation consistent with previous observations. Despite the adverse effects, considerable efficacy was also demonstrated with fludarabine bortezomib and rituximab. Although the primary goal of a phase I study is not to determine efficacy, it is encouraging that 11 of 20 evaluable patients achieved a complete or partial remission. Durable responses were observed at a variety of dose levels and were observed even in the patients who did not receive rituximab, suggesting that bortezomib added significantly to the regimen. This effect was noted despite the previous use of fludarabine in 8 patients and anti-CD20 immunotherapy in 23 patients. Treatment options are limited for patients with chemotherapy or rituximab-refractory disease. Response rates between 61% and 74% have been observed with other salvage strategies including bendamustine and radioimmunoconjugates in treatment refractory patients. Further, response rates with other bortezomib containing chemotherapeutic regimens used to treat patients with relapsed indolent NHL are comparable. In our study, 5 of 12 patients who were refractory to their last treatment regimen attained an objective response. Further, 4 of 11 patients who attained an objective response were treated at dose levels not containing rituximab suggesting notable activity of the fludarabine bortezomib combination. With this encouraging efficacy, further study using this combination in patients with refractory disease is warranted. In conclusion, we found the toxicity of fludarabine, bortezomib and rituximab to be predictable and tolerable with the major DLT being neutropenia. Further, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia resulted in a significant number of treatment interruptions and delays.

The aim of this study was to learn if inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) would produce tumor responses. This was a phase II study of oral single-agent everolimus (10 mg/day) for relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies including CLL. Four of 22 patients with CLL (18%, 95% CI: 5-40%) achieved a partial remission to therapy. An unanticipated finding in this study was an increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients. The ALC increased a median of 4.8 fold (range, 1.9 - 25.1), and the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy decreased a median of 75.5% (range, 38 - 93) compared to baseline measurements. Everolimus has modest anti-tumor activity against CLL and can mobilize malignant cells from nodal masses into the peripheral circulation in a subset of CLL patients. Because CLL cells in lymphatic tissue and bone marrow can be more resistant to therapy than circulating CLL cells, the ability of everolimus to mobilize CLL cells into the circulation could be utilized in combination therapeutic regimens. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the US with an estimated incidence of 20,000 new diagnoses per year and a prevalence of over 100,000. There is now highly effective initial therapy for previously untreated, advanced stage CLL with response rates of over 90%, complete responses (CR) in more than 40% of patients, and median response durations in excess of 3 years. In contrast, outcome remains poor for patients with relapsed or treatment-refractory CLL. More effective therapies for this group of patients are needed. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is a multifunctional signal transduction kinase with a critical role in the signal transduction pathway linking growth stimuli with cell cycle progression. Rapamycin can inhibit cell growth and proliferation, induce apoptosis in some tumor cell lines, and inhibit tumor cell motility by impairing cell polarization and protrusion. Rapamycin has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro although the required concentration was higher than is achievable in vivo and the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain. There are now two rapamycin analogs, temsirolimus and everolimus, which are currently approved by the US FDA for relapsed renal cancer. ',\n"," 'Temsirolimus also has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Although a major pathogenic mechanism in development of CLL is defective apoptosis, recent research has shown that CLL is a dynamic malignancy with cellular turnover ranging between 0.1 and 1% per day. The CLL tumor burden has two distinct cellular populations, a proliferative compartment morphologically characterized by larger cells in the proliferation centers of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, and the kinetically inactive circulating cells. A targeted inhibitor of cell division such as everolimus could be effective in the treatment of CLL, especially in patients with relapsed/refractory disease who often have more rapid cellular turnover. This hypothesis is supported by data from in vitro studies that showed that rapamycin and everolimus induce cell cycle arrest in activated CLL cells without inducing apoptosis. In addition, proliferation of CLL cells requires stromal support mediated through cytokines and adhesion molecules (e.g. integrins) and many of these supportive signals are transmitted by the PI3K and Akt pathways involving mTOR. Thus, there is a sound biological rationale for testing everolimus as a treatment for CLL. We have recently completed a phase II clinical trial using everolimus to treat patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies that included 22 patients with CLL. In this paper we report the results of treatment of the CLL patients. The most striking finding was the increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and concomitant decrease in the lymph node size observed in 8 of these patients. This was a two-stage, phase II study conducted to assess response in previously treated patients with lymphoid malignancies after treatment with single-agent everolimus. The study was conducted through the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients with CLL were eligible for this trial if they met the CLL diagnostic criteria defined by the National Cancer Institute-Working Group Criteria of 1996 (NCI-WG 1996) or the criteria for the small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) variant defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), had previously received therapy for their lymphoid malignancy, and had relapsed or were refractory to their last treatment. The relapse was required to be biopsy proven within 6 months prior to enrollment. There was no limit on the number of prior therapies. ',\n"," 'prior therapies. Patients were required to be >=18 years old, and in addition to meeting diagnostic criteria, were also required to have pre-treatment measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with at least one lesion that had a single diameter of >2 cm, or an ALC >5 x109/L. Patients were to have a life expectancy of >= 3 months; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1 x 109/L; platelet count >= 75 x 109/L; hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL; serum creatinine <= 2x the upper limit of normal (UNL); serum bilirubin <= 2 UNL (if total bilirubin >2 then a direct bilirubin of <1.5 UNL was acceptable); AST <= 3 x ULN (<= 5 x ULN if liver involvement was present). Patients could not have known HIV infection. Patients were treated with 10 mg of everolimus by mouth in the fasting state every day and 4 weeks of treatment was considered one cycle. A complete blood count was performed weekly during the first cycle and then before each subsequent cycle. If the platelet count was >=40 x 109/L, the ANC >=1 x 109/L, and there were no grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0), the full dose of everolimus was prescribed for the next cycle. Patients who did not meet the retreatment criteria had treatment held until recovery followed by a stepwise dose modification to 5 mg daily, 5 mg every other day, and 5 mg every third day. Patients did not receive prophylactic white blood cell growth factors to maintain dosing but could receive them at physician discretion if neutropenia developed. Erythropoietin treatment for anemia was also permitted at physician discretion. Patients were restaged for tumor response after 2 and 6 cycles using the NCI-WG 1996 criteria for those with an ALC > 5 x 109/L and the International Workshop Criteria for patients who had never had an ALC > 5 x 109/L (SLL variant). The maximum decrease in the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy was determined from the sum of the products of the largest lymph nodes diameters on clinical examination of the largest cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes. Patients who had disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at any time went off study. ',\n"," 'Patients with stable disease after 6 cycles continued treatment at their physician\\'s discretion.\"] Patients who had a complete remission (CR) after cycle 6 were to receive 2 cycles past CR and then could discontinue everolimus and be observed or could continue on therapy at their physician\\'s discretion.\"] Patients with a partial remission (PR) after 6 cycles of therapy continued on treatment until progression if tolerated. This phase II study used a two-stage Simon design to assess the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies. Thirty-seven evaluable patients were required to test the null hypothesis that the true response rate for this regimen is at most 20% versus the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is 40% or greater. The study had 90% power, with a 9% type I error rate. A patient was considered evaluable for response if they were eligible and received treatment. The response rate was estimated by the number of responses divided by the number of evaluable patients. A 95% binomial confidence interval for the true response rate was calculated. This report is limited to the 22 CLL patients enrolled on the study because of the unique characteristics of the response of these patients to treatment with everolimus. Duration of response (DR) was defined for patients who achieved a response as the time from the date a response was first documented until the earliest date progression was documented. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined for all patients as the time from the date of registration until the date of progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of registration until the date of death due to any cause. The distributions of time to event endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and patients who were event-free were censored on the date of last follow-up. Adverse events were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Toxicity was defined as an adverse event classified as being possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Twenty two patients with CLL (10 with the SLL variant) were enrolled on this study between January 2006 and July 2008 (Table 1). All patients were eligible and evaluable for response. The median time from diagnosis of CLL to registration was 7 years (range, 2 - 22 years). ',\n"," 'Four patients (18%, 95% CI: 5-40%) achieved a PR to therapy at 1.8, 6.4, 9.1, and 14.1 months of treatment and maintained a response for 2.2, 11.0, 19.8, and 8.9+ months, respectively. Seventeen patients had disease progression, and 15 patients have died. Causes of death included disease progression (n = 11), infection possibly attributable to treatment as detailed below (n = 2), infection unrelated to treatment (n=1), and was unknown in 1 patient. The median follow-up for patients still alive was 17 months (range, 6 - 30), the median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 4.9 - 20.7) and the median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI: 2.3 - 8.3). An unanticipated and potentially important finding of this study was the increase in the ALC associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients (Figure 1). This lymphocyte mobilization was observed in 6 (66%) of the 9 patients with an ALC > 5 x 109/L at baseline and 2 (15%) of the 13 patients with an ALC <= 5 x 109/L at baseline. Among the 8 patients in whom this phenomenon was observed, all had measurable lymphadenopathy at baseline and in 6 (75%) at least one node was >= 5 cm in diameter. The ALC increased from a median baseline level of 7.1 x 109/L (range, 0.7 - 101.2) to 18.3 x 109/L (range, 1.2 - 415.3) at the first post-treatment ALC (median interval from start of therapy 29 days, range, 7 - 49)(Figure 2). Patients achieved a median of 76% (range, 38 - 93) decrease in clinically measurable node size compared to baseline. This was associated with a median 4.8 fold (range, 1.9 - 25.1) increase in the ALC compared to baseline (median, 38.4 x 109/L; range, 3.8 - 415.3) which occurred at a median interval of 43 days (range, 29 - 242) from the start of therapy. Of the 8 patients with lymphocyte mobilization, 2 achieved a clinical PR (both had SLL), 4 had clinically stable disease, 1 had disease progression, and 1 was removed from the study because of an adverse event before clinical response could be evaluated. Lymphocyte mobilization was not an anticipated finding in this study and the mechanism of this response was not studied. ',\n"," 'In one patient with lymphocyte mobilization a bone marrow (BM) examination was performed on day 6 of everolimus treatment due to concern about the patient\\'s clinical status.\"] Although the results of the BM biopsy showed minimal change compared to baseline, the majority of the BM and circulating lymphocytes had the same morphological appearance of CLL cells. This finding suggests that the increase in circulating lymphocytes was caused by an increase in CLL cells. No confirmatory immunophenotyping studies were done on the circulating lymphocytes. Patients received a median of 2 months (range, 1 week - 29 months) and a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-18) of treatment. Twenty patients have gone off treatment, 13 due to disease progression, 3 due to toxicity (1 patient with grade 2 pancreatitis, 1 patient with grade 3 fatigue, 1 cytopenia), 2 died on-study (1 patient due to sepsis possibly related to treatment, 1 patient died from disease progression), and 2 patients refused further therapy without response or progression. Nine patients experienced dose delays on 12 cycles of therapy due to hematological adverse events (10 cycles), hospitalization (1 cycle), and a delay in getting laboratory results (1 cycle). Nine patients experienced dose reductions on 11 cycles due to hematological adverse events (9 cycles), mucositis (1 cycle), and infection (1 cycle). Fifteen patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse event (7 grade 3, 8 grade 4) and 9 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse event (5 grade 3, 1 grade 4, 3 grade 5). Focusing on adverse events at least possibly attributable to the study therapy (Table 2), 14 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity (6 grade 3, 8 grade 4) and 7 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (5 grade 3, 2 grade 5). Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 23%, 32%, and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities were pneumonia (n = 2) and hypertriglyceridemia (n = 2). One patient, who died of infection with positive blood cultures, had grade 4 adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicating sepsis and grade 3 neutropenia, both complications were considered to be probably related to treatment. Another patient with grade 2 neutropenia died of sepsis possibly related to treatment. Treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL using single agent everolimus showed biological activity with 18% of patients achieving a PR. ',\n"," 'An additional finding was that 36% of patients had an unexpected and marked increase in the ALC with a concomitant decease in lymph node size. These results show that everolimus can be clinically active in some patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, and suggest that mTOR inhibition can mobilize CLL cells from tissue sites into the circulation. Both of these findings could have important implications for the treatment of CLL. Patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, especially those with purine analogue refractory disease or loss of p53 function because of gene deletions or mutations, have a poor prognosis. The 18% PR rate achieved with everolimus therapy in this study, although modest, warrants further study in light of the heavily pretreated nature of the patient population, the fact that this study used single agent everolimus, and that tumor cell mobilization was observed. In addition, the modest response rate needs to be interpreted in the context of the NCI-WG 1996 criteria that requires a minimum 50% decrease in the ALC to qualify for a response to treatment. The increase in ALC observed in 6 of the patients with CLL who had a decrease in adenopathy, prevents them from being considered responsive to treatment. This could have resulted in an underestimation of the efficacy of single agent everolimus therapy in this group of patients. The mobilization effect observed could be especially useful for selecting drugs to be tested in combination with everolimus. In the only previously published report of the treatment of patients with CLL using everolimus, the pilot trial was stopped after treatment of only 7 patients because of infectious complications. Of the treated patients, one achieved a PR and 3 had stable disease. Although not commented on by the authors, review of the published data shows that 6 of the 7 patients appear to have had progressive lymphocytosis in response to initiation of therapy with everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/day; there was no information on the effect of everolimus on lymphadenopathy. The stromal microenvironment of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow provides critical support for CLL cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to therapeutic drugs. Pre-clinical data suggests that disruption of the interaction between CLL cells and stroma can decrease drug resistance in CLL cells. In addition, the therapeutic unconjugated monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab and rituximab, which are highly effective against circulating CLL cells, have limited efficacy against bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly. ',\n"," 'Mobilization of CLL cells from tissue into the circulation is likely to remove these CLL cells from the protective stromal microenvironment and enhance the cytotoxicity of drugs such as alemtuzumab which have the additional advantage of being effective in patients with purine analogue refractory CLL with defective p53 function. Combinations of everolimus and drugs such as alemtuzumab could potentially be synergistic in patients with bulky adenopathy resulting in improved treatment outcomes. Everolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that can also be myelosuppressive. Thus, it was not surprising that infections were observed in this study of CLL patients already immunocompromised by their underlying disease and prior therapy. Indeed, infection resulted in 2 deaths. Neutropenia could have contributed to the risk of infection, but thrombocytopenia was not associated with bleeding complications. The other grade 3-4 toxicities responded well to appropriate management. These data suggest that CLL patients treated with everolimus in the future will likely benefit from prophylaxis and surveillance for opportunistic infections, and that combination therapies including everolimus should be designed to minimize marrow toxicity in this patient population. The mTOR has been shown to be an integral component of important signaling pathways in CLL cells, and inhibition of these pathways by everolimus could be expected to decrease cell growth and be cytotoxic. In contrast, the mechanism by which everolimus causes CLL cell mobilization into the circulation is unknown and will need to be investigated in order to develop interventions to optimize this effect. These investigations were not performed in this study because the finding was unexpected. The extent of mobilization and the concomitant decrease in the clinically detectable lymphadenopathy was only fully appreciated at the time of analysis of the study results. The study was designed to evaluate ALC each cycle and measurable lymph nodes after cycles two and six and every three cycles thereafter. The study was not designed to measure or record ALC more frequently; therefore, the kinetics and magnitude of the CLL cell mobilization could actually have been underestimated in this study population. Future studies should be designed to more frequently measure the mobilization effect of everolimus in CLL patients, study the cell surface immunophenotype of the mobilized cells, and determine if the CLL cells mobilized into the circulation are as sensitive to monoclonal antibody mediated cytotoxicity as cells collected prior to treatment with everolimus. ',\n"," 'In conclusion, this study shows that everolimus could be a valuable drug for use in combination therapy for CLL patients. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

Several Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including the F317L and F317V mutations. In this study, we evaluated INNO-406 in Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) post-imatinib resistance or intolerance. A dose escalation study was conducted with a starting dose of 30mg administered orally once daily. Cohorts of at least 3 patients were treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Twice-daily (BID) dosing was also evaluated. Therapy was allowed for a maximum of 24 months. INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with imatinib resistance (n=40) or intolerance (n=16). Other previous treatments included nilotinib (n=20), dasatinib (n=26), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n=9). Common mutations upon study entry included Y253H (n=6), G250E (n=4), T315I (n=4) and F317L (n=3). Among 31 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with INNO-406, the major cytogenetic response rate was 19%. In this study, no responses were seen in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at INNO-406 480mg BID were liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. INNO-406 showed anti-CML efficacy in this heavily pretreated study population. Based on the classical determinations of both DLT and MTD, the recommended phase 2 dose of INNO-406 is 240mg orally BID. Lower doses of INNO-406 may be equally effective and should be explored. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which >=95% of patients display a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome abnormality yields a fusion gene encoding a constitutively active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase that is considered essential for the pathophysiology of CML. In the United States, about 5000 people are diagnosed with CML each year. Historically, the 5-year survival rate for patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) was approximately 40%. Since the introduction in 2001 of the first specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib mesylate, the estimated 5 to 7-year survival rates for newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have increased to over 90%. As patients with CML live longer, prevalence of the disease is expected to increase over the coming years. The success of imatinib demonstrates that specific inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase has clinical benefits in the treatment of CML. ',\n"," 'However, based on the findings of a 5-year follow up assessment, imatinib resistance occurs at a rate of approximately 4% per year. Resistance is believed to be due to 3 main mechanisms: (1) increased expression of Bcr-Abl; (2) Bcr-Abl mutations; and (3) the development of Bcr-Abl-independent resistance pathways, such as Lyn kinase activation. In patients with Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or those with CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP) or blastic phase (CML-BP), imatinib treatment often fails to achieve high rates of complete cytogenetic response; these patients frequently develop resistance to therapy and relapse. In 20% to 55% of such patients, treatment resistance can be attributed to the emergence of clones with mutant forms of Bcr-Abl, which exhibit a decreased sensitivity to imatinib. More than 60 mutant forms of Bcr-Abl have been detected, the most common of which are E255K, T315I, and M351T. Mutants have varying degrees of imatinib resistance, and thus more potent Bcr-Abl inhibitors or dual Abl/Lyn inhibitors may improve treatment results. INNO-406, a dual Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may be an effective treatment for certain leukemias (Ph-positive CML and ALL). INNO-406, was developed to overcome imatinib resistance. Unlike other second-generation TKIs, INNO-406 demonstrates specific Lyn kinase activity with no or limited activity against other Src-family member kinases. Numerous Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including the F317L and F317V mutations. INNO-406 is 25 to 55 times more potent than imatinib against Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cell lines K562 and KU812 and against BaF3 cells overexpressing unmutated Bcr-Abl (BaF3/um). Autophosphorylation of unmutated Bcr-Abl is also more potently inhibited by INNO-406 than by imatinib. In vivo, INNO-406 is at least 10 times more potent than imatinib. Chemically, INNO-406 is a 2-phenlaminopyrimidine with structural resemblance to both imatinib and nilotinib. The molecular structure of INNO-406 is shown in Figure 1. This phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized dose-escalation study was conducted at 6 international sites from July 17, 2006, to November 28, 2007, to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical activity of INNO-406 administered orally daily in adult patients with Ph-positive CML or ALL post-imatinib resistance or intolerance. Patients with Ph-positive leukemias, including CML-CP, CML-AP, CML-BP, and Ph-positive ALL), and imatinib resistance or intolerance were included in the trial. The definitions of imatinib resistance and intolerance were as previously described. ',\n"," 'greater than or equal to 15,000 cells/mm3, documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 2 week) or cytogenetic (greater than 35% of Ph-positive cells in the bone marrow after at least 1 year of therapy, or an absolute rise in the percentage of Ph-positive cells of 30% over best response). Imatinib intolerance was defined as the presence of any toxicity that prevented patients from receiving therapy (according to the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 [CTCAE v3.0] grade 3 or 4 toxicity or persistent grade 2 toxicity). Patients with resistance or intolerance to other second-line TKIs, such as dasatinib or nilotinib, were also included. Definitions of CML phases were as previously reported. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be 18 years of age or older, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2, and have normal cardiac, hepatic, and renal functions. Females enrolled in the study could not be pregnant or lactating. Patients were not allowed to have received chemotherapy within 1 week or imatinib within 3 days before the start of the trial. Exceptions included hydroxyurea administration, as clinically indicated before and during the first 21 days of treatment, and corticosteroids up to 48 hours before the first study dose. Patients with comorbid states, such as opportunistic and/or uncontrolled systemic infections, impaired gastrointestinal function, psychiatric disorders, and/or sustained toxicity from prior therapies, were excluded from the study, as were those with a history of another primary malignancy of clinical significance requiring intervention. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at each study site. Patients were required to provide written informed consent. The primary objective of this phase 1 study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of INNO-406. Secondary objectives included evaluation of response, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The starting dose of INNO-406 was 30 mg administered orally once daily (QD), equaling 10% of the 30 mg/kg dose level used in a previous 4-week rat toxicity study, at which no deaths occurred (data on file). In the absence of a CTCAE v3.0 grade 2 or higher drug-related toxicity, the dose of INNO-406 was escalated by 100% in cohorts of at least 3 patients. If grade 2 drug-related toxicity occurred, INNO-406 dose was increased by 50% until the MTD was reached. ',\n"," 'The INNO-406 doses evaluated were: 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 mg QD, and then 120, 240, and 480 mg administered orally twice daily (BID). Because all of the patients in the 480 mg BID cohort experienced toxicities, a BID cohort between the 240 mg and 480 mg BID cohorts was evaluated; this intermediate cohort received 360 mg BID. Once the MTD was determined, up to 20 patients in each of the 3 CML phases and up to 20 patients with Ph-positive ALL were treated at that dose. Intrapatient dose escalation of INNO-406 was permitted in patients who had a suboptimal response to INNO-406 therapy only after the next dose level had been documented to be safe. A suboptimal response was defined as a failure to achieve either a hematologic response after 1 month or a major cytogenetic response after 6 months of therapy. This is based on observations that failure to achieve early hematologic response or major cytogenetic response after 6-12 months are associated with worse outcome. At each step, the investigators evaluated the relevant risks and benefits of continued study participation for each patient. No more than 2 dose reductions were allowed before the patient was withdrawn from the study, unless this was considered in the patient\\'s best interest.\"] Patients were removed from therapy or further assessment upon disease progression, physician decision that a change in therapy was in the patient\\'s best interest, or by patient\\'s request.\"] Other reasons for removal of patients from the study were continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal dose reduction, noncompliance, and pregnancy. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v3.0 criteria. Disease response was assessed at specified intervals by disease-specific response criteria. Response criteria were as previously described. A complete hematologic response (CHR) was defined as normal white blood cell count (WBC) with normal differential and platelet counts <450x109/L, and no signs or symptoms of leukemia, including no splenomegaly. Cytogenetic response was defined as complete (0% Ph-positive), partial (1-35% Ph-positive), and minor (36-95% Ph-positive). A major cytogenetic response included complete and partial cytogenetic responses (i.e., <= 35% Ph-positive). The incidence, severity, duration, causality, seriousness, and type of adverse events, physical examination changes, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results were recorded and tabulated. Standard pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined, together with the coefficient of variation of INNO-406 concentrations, to guide decision-making with regard to dosing level and frequency. ',\n"," 'Patients were evaluated for both complete and partial hematologic and cytogenetic responses. Mutational analyses were performed as previously detailed. INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with Ph-positive CML or ALL and resistance to (n = 40 [71%]) or intolerance of (n = 16 [29%]) imatinib (Table 1). Twenty-seven patients (48%) were females. In addition to imatinib, most of the patients had been treated previously with other TKIs, including dasatinib (n = 26), nilotinib (n = 20), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n = 9). Forty-six patients had failed at least two TKIs (imatinib and dasatinib or nilotinib); nine of the 46 patients had failed all three TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib); 10 of the 56 patients failed only imatinib. Fourteen patients (25%) were resistant to and 12 (21%) were intolerant of dasatinib. Seventeen (30%) patients were nilotinib resistant and 3 (5%) patients were nilotinib intolerant. The median duration of CML was 84 months (range, 43 to 267 months). Median durations of INNO-406 treatment were 3.7 months (range, 1 to 12 months) for the overall study group and 4.4 months (range, 1 to 12 months) for the subgroup with CML-CP. All 17 patients enrolled at 240 mg BID after determination of the MTD had CML-CP. INNO-406 was well tolerated, and QD dosing cohorts of 30 to 480 mg QD were treated without the development of DLTs. After pharmacokinetic analyses suggested that BID dosing might be beneficial, BID dosing cohorts were initiated, beginning with 120 mg BID. At a dose level of 480 mg BID, DLTs, including elevations of transaminases and thrombocytopenia, were observed. Transaminase elevations were still noted at an INNO-406 dose of 360 mg BID; these included grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in 4 patients and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations in 2 patients. Seventeen patients were then enrolled at 240 mg BID as part of a protocol-specified expansion cohort, which was limited to patients with CML-CP. In the 17 patients treated with 240 mg BID, transaminase elevations were still observed but were less severe. No patients had drug-related grade 3 AST elevations and only 1 patient had a drug-related grade 3 ALT elevation. Drug related grade 2 ALT elevations occurred at the 240 mg BID dose level in 9 patients, and a grade 2 AST elevation developed in 1 patient. ',\n"," 'The elevated transaminase levels observed at 240 mg BID resolved when INNO-406 dosing was withheld temporarily and then resumed at a lower dose. Based on these results, an INNO-406 dose of 240 mg BID is proposed for phase 2 studies. In addition to elevated transaminases, the other most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse event noted was thrombocytopenia (Table 2). When both drug- and non-drug-related thrombocytopenic events were considered, 2 and 3 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia, respectively, including 1 patient who initiated INNO-406 treatment with preexisting grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts recovered when INNO-406 was withheld and then resumed at a lower dose. This study incorporated a planned central evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the first cycle of therapy to assess for QT prolongation. During this period of intense monitoring, the QTcB increased to grade 2 in 4 patients and the QTcF increased to grade 2 in 1 patient. Only 1 patient, who entered the study with a waiver due to a prolonged QTc, developed a QTc >500 msec during this routine monitoring after cycle 1. The patient experienced no further events after discontinuing INNO-406. The NCI categories of adverse events that were experienced by >=10% of patients were metabolic/laboratory (73.2%), gastrointestinal (64.3%), pain (58.9%), constitutional symptoms (48.2%), infection (33.9%), dermatology/skin (28.6%), blood/bone marrow (25.0%), lymphatics (25.0%), neurology (23.2%), pulmonary/upper respiratory (17.9%), cardiac general (12.5%), hemorrhage/bleeding (10.7%), and musculoskeletal/soft tissue (10.7%). Five patients have died since beginning treatment; all deaths were related to leukemia progression. Four deaths were among 16 patients in CML blastic phase or Ph-positive ALL; 1 death was among 8 patients in CML accelerated phase; no deaths so far have been recorded among 31 patients in chronic phase. The 5 deaths did not appear to be correlated to dosing regimen: 1 at 30 mg daily, 2 at 120 mg daily, 1 at 480 mg BID, 1 at 360 mg BID. No cases of pleural or pericardial effusions were noted. Table 3 provides a detailed summary of cytogenetic responses. All of the patients who achieved a cytogenetic response had CML-CP. No responses were observed in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with CML-CP. Three patients had a complete cytogenetic response, one at each of the INNO-406 dose schedules of 120 mg QD, 120 mg BID, and 240 mg BID. ',\n"," 'The remaining 3 patients had a partial cytogenetic response: 2 patients at 240 mg BID and 1 patient at 480 mg BID. None of the six major cytogenetic responders had baseline cytogenetic clonal evolution. Thus, 4 of the major cytogenetic responses occurred in patients treated with INNO-406 doses of 240 mg BID or greater. This represents a major cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled, and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CML-CP. For the patients with major cytogenetic responses, the pretreatment regimens and the associated reasons for changes in therapy are listed in Table 4, which also provides the mutation status at baseline (eg, prior to INNO-406 exposure). Two additional patients achieved a minimal cytogenetic response. Complete and partial hematologic responses were observed in 3 patients. Illustrative of the pharmacokinetic data seen in the full analyses, the pharmacokinetic parameters of INNO-406 in the 240 mg BID cohort are presented here. This cohort was selected based on clinical safety and efficacy evaluations that took events at the higher doses into consideration. As illustrated in Figure 2, accumulation of INNO-406 was observed on day 15 for both the 360 and 480 mg BID cohorts. For the 240 mg BID cohort, the mean time to achieve peak concentration (Cmax = 487 ng/mL) was 1.3 hours (standard deviation [SD] = 0.5). Pharmacokinetic analyses performed in the entire study population also demonstrated an increase in Cmax with increasing INNO-406 doses for both QD and BID dosing. The half-life was relatively short; mean (SD) half-lives for BID dosing on day 1 and day 15 were 1.99 hours (0.817) and 2.28 hours (0.751), respectively. For BID dosing, the mean (SD) accumulation factor was 2.73 (4.96). The maximum concentration and area under the curve (Cmax and AUC) were dose proportional; however, dose proportionality for AUC was not demonstrable with BID dosing. Mutational analysis performed at the central laboratories revealed mutations in 22 of 49 patients (45%) analyzed. Common mutations included Y253H in 6 patients, G250E in 4 patients, T315I in 4 patients, and F317L in 3 patients. This phase 1 study of INNO-406, a novel, potent dual BCR-AbL/Lyn TKI, evaluated dose levels ranging from once-daily doses of 30 to 480 mg and from BID doses of 120 to 480 mg. The DLTs observed included liver dysfunction and myelosuppression. ',\n"," 'The proposed INNO 406 dose scheduled for phase 2 study is 240 mg orally BID, and this value is based on the classical determinations of DLT and MTD from phase I studies. Lower dose schedules of INNO-406 may be as effective and should be explored. In this heavily pretreated study group of 56 patients, INNO-406 therapy resulted in 6 major cytogenetic responses (3 complete and 3 partial), all in 31 patients treated for CML-CP, for a major cytogenetic response rate of 19%. Of the 56 patients treated in this study, 71% were resistant to and 29% were intolerant of imatinib. In addition, 26 patients experienced resistance to or intolerance of dasatinib, and 20 patients, resistance to or intolerance of nilotinib. In the majority of patients, therefore, prior treatment with multiple Bcr-Abl TKIs had failed. As many of the patients in this study were being treated in the third-line setting, a lower response rate would be expected than seen in the second-line setting represented by the dasatinib and nilotinib studies. In this study, no responses were seen in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with CML-CP. Four of the responses occurred in patients in the cohort that received a starting INNO-406 dose of 240 mg BID or greater. This represents a major cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CML-CP. Major cytogenetic responses have been reported in 40% to 45% of patients with CML-CP treated in the second-line setting with dasatinib or nilotinib. It is unclear what response would be expected with dasatinib or nilotinib in a study population that included both second- and third-line setting patients. Myelosuppression and pleural effusions are serious adverse events that have been seen with dasatinib, and myelosuppression and liver dysfunction, with nilotinib., 25 These events were observed infrequently with INNO-406. The safety profile of INNO-406 is therefore unique, offering a potential advantage in the treatment of patients who have developed toxicities during treatment with other Bcr-Abl TKIs. Of note, a planned central evaluation of ECGs during the first cycle of INNO-406 therapy revealed only 1 patient with a QTc >500 msec; this patient, who had an elevated QTc at baseline, entered the study with a waiver. ',\n"," 'Mutational analysis revealed mutations prior to the start of INNO-406 in 22 of the 49 patients analyzed (45%). Among these were 4 patients who had T315I mutations, which are known to confer resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. None of the 4 patients with T315I mutations responded to INNO-406. Outcomes of CML treatment have improved dramatically since the introduction of imatinib mesylate. The rising incidence of imatinib resistance and intolerance has resulted in the need for alternative agents. Nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are second-generation TKIs that have been developed to overcome imatinib resistance. All 3 agents have similar efficacy with slightly different adverse effect profiles. There is a need for additional agents that are more potent than both imatinib and the existing second-generation TKIs. As patients are being treated longer, they are more commonly cycling through different treatment regimens. This study demonstrates that INNO-406 is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg BID. Lower dose schedules may also be equally effective and deserve further evaluation. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of INNO-406 in patients who have developed resistance to or intolerance of imatinib and/or other TKIs. INNO-406, an oral dual Abl/Lyn kinase inhibitor, is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg BID in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. ',\n"," '.

Over time, however, virtually all CLL patients become fludarabine-refractory. To elucidate whether microRNAs are involved in the development of fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the expression of 723 human miRNAs before and 5-days after fludarabine mono-therapy in 17 CLL patients which were classified as responder or refractory to fludarabine treatment based on NCI criteria. By comparing the expression profiles of these two groups of patients, we identified a microRNA signature able to distinguish refractory from sensitive CLLs. The expression of some microRNAs was also able to predict fludarabine resistance of 12 independent CLL patients. Among the identified microRNAs, miR-148a, miR-222 and miR-21 exhibited a significantly higher expression in non-responder patients either before and after fludarabine treatment. After performing messenger RNA expression profile of the same patients, the activation of p53-responsive genes was detected in fludarabine responsive cases only, therefore suggesting a possible mechanism linked to microRNA deregulation in non-responder patients. Importantly, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides induced a significant increase in caspase activity in fludarabine-treated p53-mutant MEG-01 cells, suggesting that miR-21 and miR-222 up-regulation may be involved in the establishment of fludarabine resistance. This is the first report that reveals the existence of a microRNA profile that differentiate refractory and sensitive CLLs, either before and after fludarabine mono-therapy. A p53 dysfunctional pathway emerged in refractory CLLs and could contribute in explaining the observed miRNA profile. Moreover, this work indicates that specific microRNAs can be used to predict fludarabine resistance and may potentially be used as therapeutic targets, therefore establishing an important starting point for future studies. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common hematologic neoplasia in the Western world and is characterized by a clonal expansion of CD5+ B-cells. The disease may have a long and indolent course, not requiring treatment for years, or it may rapidly progress. Initially most patients respond to purine nucleoside analogs, which today represent pivotal agents for first and second-line treatment. However a significant fraction of patients do not respond or become resistant to fludarabine in the years and prognosis for this group of patients is poor. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. It has been reported that p53 dysfunction, deriving from 17p13 deletion, predicts non-response to fludarabine therapy and poor prognosis. ',\n"," 'Other genetic factors associated with poor prognosis, such as del(11q22.3) and immunoglobulin (Ig) V(H) unmutated status, have been also associated with shorter progression-free survival after chemotherapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes, through their wide action as post-transcriptional gene expression modulators. In CLL, miR-15/16 were shown to be located within 13q14 deletion; they were shown to act as tumor suppressor genes, possibly through the modulation of BCL2 and various other target genes. A germline mutation affecting miRNA maturation was detected in few cases of familial CLL as well as in the New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse strain, a mice developing a B lymphoproliferative disease that is a model for human CLL. A set of miRNAs was able to distinguish CLLs from normal CD5+ B-cells and 13 miRNAs associated to CLL prognostic groups were identified through the identification of the molecular profiles of CLLs with IgVH mutated or unmutated status combined with ZAP70 levels. Likewise, miR-29c and miR-223 have been used to create a quantitative PCR-based score able to improve CLL patients stratification in terms of treatment free survival and overall survival, when combined with two other prognostic factors. Recently, Zenz and colleagues found that fludarabine-refractory CLLs were characterized more frequently (53%) by lower levels of miR-34a than sensitive CLLs (9%). MiR-34a has been implicated in CLL response to DNA damage through a p53-mediated induction, while miR-106b has been linked to Itch inhibition, and consequent p73 activation, in deacetylase inhibitors treated CLLs. Fludarabine is an active agent in CLL and, it is frequently used nowadays in combination regimens in first and second line treatment, especially in younger and fit patients. Fludarabine as single agent produces better response rates than chlorambucil and represents a reasonable choice as single agent in frail or elderly patients. Because specific miRNAs may be involved in patients response to fludarabine treatment and in the development of fludarabine resistance, we designed this study aimed at identifying the miRNA expression profile associated with the response to fludarabine, used as a single agent, in the treatment of patients with CLL. To investigate the possible involvement of miRNAs in fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the miRNA expression profile of 17 CLL patients, before and after 5 days of treatment with fludarabine as single agent. ',\n"," 'NCI criteria, 9 of the patients exhibited a clinical response (CR), i.e. they attained either complete or partial response, while 8 patients were resistant to the treatment and were classified as non responders (NR). Characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table 1. An additional blind cohort of 12 patients was recruited among patients who were treated with fludarabine (Table 1), to test the efficacy of specific miRNAs as response predictors. We evaluated the miRNAs expression in 33 samples obtained from CLL patients before and after treatment, hereafter called pre and post, through the hybridization on a miRNA platform (Agilent technologies) able to assess the expression levels of 723 human miRNAs (MiRBASE release 10.1). First, we identified the miRNAs induced or repressed by fludarabine treatment by comparing post CLLs to the pre-treatment samples (fold change >1.5 and p-value < 0.05). We compared pre and post samples in the entire groups or in the NR and CR sub-groups separately, which revealed 97, 67 and 60 differentially expressed miRNAs, respectively. Among these, using Venn Diagram intersection, we identified 37 miRNAs that were differentially expressed either in the CR cohort and in the NR cohort of samples (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). A hierarchical clustering algorithm, performed using the list of 37 miRNAs, correctly classified the pre versus post fludarabine samples (Figure 1). The complete list of miRNAs that were identified as differentially expressed either in the CR cohort or in the NR cohort of samples or both can be found in Additional file 2: Table S2. The post versus pre treatment analysis revealed that 37 miRNAs were similarly modulated by fludarabine in both NR and CR patients. This set of miRNAs indicated common mechanisms modulated by fludarabine, but could not reveal mechanisms underlying resistance to treatment. However, many additional miRNAs exhibited a different modulation in CRs versus NRs, which could be used to derive a miRNA signature associated with fludarabine resistance. To investigate this hypothesis, we searched for miRNAs whose expression was significantly different between these two cohorts of CLL patients. Analyses of pre and post treatment samples were performed separately. The lists of differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained by statistical analysis of microarray data (Table 2 and 3). ',\n"," 'The comparison of CR and NR patients led to the identification of 10 differentially expressed miRNAs in the pre-treatment setting (p < 0.05), listed in Table 2. This set of miRNAs was used to classify the patients by a clusterization algorithm. Eighty-two percent of patients were correctly classified by a cluster analysis (all but three: CLL 11, 18 and 22) (Figure 2A). The comparison of CRs and NRs in the post-treatment setting led to the identification of 11 miRNAs differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive patients (p < 0.05) (Table 3). Cluster analysis of these miRNAs was able to correctly classify 88% samples (all but two: CLL 4 and 22) (Figure 2B). We validated the microarray results for miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) on the same group of 16 post samples, adding also 3 new samples. We chose these miRNAs considering the extent of their modulation and because they are differentially expressed both before and after the treatment. The expression level of every miRNA in every post CLL was assayed in triplicate and normalized on U6 RNA expression levels. Microarray results were confirmed by RT-qPCR in every group of CLLs (Additional file 3: Figure S1). To verify whether the three validated miRNAs (miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222) might be able to predict the efficacy of fludarabine treatment and might therefore become useful in directing patients therapy, we collected a new cohort of 12 patients (test set). These patients were treated by fludarabine as single agent because of disease progression. Samples were collected immediately before the treatment and the miRNA expression was assayed by RT-qPCR. In this new cohort, results were even more clear than in the microarray training set of samples (Figure 3A). Patients classified as NRs displayed a significantly (p < 0.05 at two-tailed t-test) increased expression of miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222 if compared to patients sensitive to treatment. Interestingly, we were also able to predict the response to treatment of newly diagnosed patients by using a score based on the combination of miR-21, 148a and 222 expression levels. Using this score based on quantitative expression of 3 miRNAs, prediction was 100% accurate (Figure 3B). To better elucidate the molecular context responsible for the differential expression of miRNAs in NR versus CR patients, we performed a mRNA expression profile on a subgroup of the samples. ',\n"," 'Experiments data were obtained for pre and post fludarabine treatment of 14 patients (the same employed for miRNA analysis, except CLL-04, CLL-09 and CLL-16A, whose RNA was not available), 7 of them were CRs and 7 NRs. We hybridized the samples on a human mRNA platform (Agilent Technologies) able to assess the expression levels 41,000 human transcripts. We performed an analysis aimed at identifying the genes induced or repressed by the pharmacologic treatment, with a particular interest in genes modulated only in CRs or NRs. To this end, we normalized the expression of every gene in each post sample to the expression of the same gene in the matched pre sample. We identified the mRNAs that exhibited a significant differential modulation (p-value < 0.05) after fludarabine treatment, separately analyzing refractory and sensitive CLLs (data not shown). Then, we identified the most significant pathways modulated by fludarabine through a Pathway Enrichment analysis of the two gene lists. Interestingly, the p53 pathway emerged as the most significantly induced pathway in the cohort of CR patients (Table 4). For example, G1/S and G2/M DNA damage checkpoints, p53 stabilization and p53-dependent response, BH3-only proteins pathways were all significantly enriched in the CR cohort of CLL patients. Conversely, the same pathways were not enriched or were less significant in NR patients, indicating that NR CLLs had a dysfunctional p53 pathway. A pathway representative of p53 cell cycle control was generated, coloring the genes with the expression levels in CR and NR groups (Figure 4A), while the average expression level of all the genes involved in p53 pathway is graphically represented in Figure 4B. The above results suggest that an abnormal miRNA expression may be involved in the generation of fludarabine resistance. Among the various miRNAs differentially expressed between NR versus CR patients, miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a emerged as significantly up-regulated in two different cohorts of refractory patients, both before and after fludarabine administration. MiR-21 has a well-established role in protection from apoptosis and drug-response modulation and miR-222 is an important cell cycle regulator through its action on p27. We therefore investigated whether their inhibition could improve fludarabine cell death activity in the human MEG-01 cell model. We employed the MEG-01 cell line because it carries a 13q14 deletion affecting miR-15a/miR-16-1, typical of CLL, and a mutant TP53 gene. ',\n"," 'MiR-16 is indeed down-regulated (fold-change 2.3, p = 0.07) in pre-treatment fludarabine-refractory CLLs, and, as above indicated, NRs are defective in the p53 pathway. These cells may therefore mimic features which are responsible for resistance to fludarabine. We hypothesized that anti-miR-21, 148a and 222 could be implicated in fludarabine-induced apoptotic process. We therefore assayed the MEG-01 cells for Caspase 3/7 activation (Caspase 3/7 Glo assay, Promega); MEG-01 cells were treated for 24 hours with LNA anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-222 or anti-miR-148a followed by addition of fludarabine for additional 24 hours. A significant (p < 0.01) increase of caspase 3/7 activity was detected for miR-21 and miR-222 (Figure 5A, B) while no difference was observed for miR-148a (Figure 5C). We hereby concluded that the high miR-21 and miR-222 levels may be responsible for a weaker apoptotic effect of fludarabine in refractory patients, while the mechanism of action of miR-148a remains to be established. We analyzed the expression profile of 29 CLL patients who were treated by fludarabine, a pivotal drug in the modern treatment of CLL. To better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of fludarabine resistance, we investigated the miRNA expression alterations of patients who received fludarabine as single agent, thus avoiding the potentially confounding elements that are inevitably present when fludarabine is used in combination with other drugs. Moreover, samples were obtained before and after first fludarabine treatment from the same patient, making it possible to directly evaluate the effect of the drug in vivo. Our results revealed that many miRNAs are modulated by fludarabine treatment, as shown by the 37 miRNAs that are modulated following the treatment in both CR and NR patients, while 23 and 30 miRNAs were differentially modulated only in CRs or NRs, respectively, suggesting that these two cohorts of patients show signs of differences in the execution of molecular pathways modulated by fludarabine. Indeed, in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these miRNAs, we analyzed the molecular pathways modulated by fludarabine in sensitive and refractory CLLs that emerged by mRNA expression analysis. The discovery that many p53 pathway genes (i.e. ',\n"," 'CDKN1A, BBC3/PUMA, PCNA, GADD45A) were activated in CRs but not in NRs provides further support to the notion that fludarabine treatment of patients with CLL induces a p53-dependent gene expression response and that a defective p53 pathway in refractory CLLs, due to 17p deletions, p53 mutations and other p53-linked dysfunctions, is associated with fludarabine resistance. It is therefore possible that the differential expression of miRNAs between CR versus NR patients may be affected by a defective p53 pathway. Interestingly, it has been reported that miR-221/222 cluster is repressed by p53, implicating that a non-functional p53 pathway may lead to its up-regulation, as detected in NR patients. An example of an aberrantly expressed miRNA influenced by p53 in fludarabine-refractory CLL has been recently reported by Zenz and colleagues, who observed a higher frequency of fludarabine refractory CLLs in the group of low-expressing miR-34a, than in similar patients with high expression of this miRNA. MiR-34a was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of p53. Although we did not find a significant differential expression level of miR-34a in NR compared with CR CLLs, our data concur with those of Zenz et al., in fact 3 patients with the 17p deletion involved in this study displayed no miR-34a expression (data not shown). By comparing the miRNA expression profile of sensitive and refractory CLLs, we have been able to identify expression signatures that could correctly classify more than 80% of the CR vs NR cases, either before or after treatment. Interestingly, after validation by quantitative PCR of the most significant miRNAs (miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a) in an independent population, the prediction of response to therapy for pre-therapy samples was impressive: a predictive score based on miRNA expression levels reached an overall accuracy of 100%. This information may have important clinical implications because it might spare subsequent treatment in patients identified as resistant during disease progression. MiRNAs aberrant expression may not only represent a phenomenon able to reveal an underlying molecular defect, such as p53 dysfunction, but it may also represent one of the possible mechanisms responsible for fludarabine resistance. In this study, we found that some miRNAs, namely miR-222, miR-148a and miR-21 were differentially expressed between NR and CR CLLs both before and after fludarabine treatment and were all up-regulated in the NR group. These findings, not previously described in CLL, appears to be truly significant. ',\n"," 'Indeed, miR-222 can target the cell growth suppressive cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p57 and the c-KIT receptor (source: Tarbase) thus promoting cell cycle progression. Among the recently validated targets there are the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BMF, the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which are both involved in tongue carcinoma metastasis promotion and whose expression is frequently altered in cancer. An higher expression of miR-222 has been associated with poor survival in pancreatic cancer and the enforced expression of miR-221/222 improved the growth of prostate carcinoma xenografts in mice. Moreover, anti-sense inhibition of miR-221 could increase susceptibility to gemcitabine. MiR-21 up-regulation appears to be an important mechanism of malignant transformation, since it was found up-regulated in several types of neoplasia (see Spizzo et al. for a list); it accounts, among the known validated targets, numerous tumors suppressor genes, such as TPM1, PDCD4, maspin (SERPINB3) and PTEN (source: Tarbase). New interesting targets of miR-21 were recently identified through the validation of proteomic results. It was also correlated with poor prognosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma, colon, breast and pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, the use of the anti-miR-21 AMOs increases susceptibility of colangiocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine and elicit a pro-apoptotic response in glioblastoma and breast cancer cells. Here, we report that inhibition of miR-222 and miR-21 in the MEG-01 human cells using an anti-miRNA oligonucleotide increases susceptibility to fludarabine, as shown by the significant increase in caspase activity. Our findings suggest a direct role of miR-222 and miR-21 in conferring resistance to fludarabine chemotherapy independently from the p53 pathway, which is dysfunctional in this human cell line. Less clear is the role of miR-148a. MiR-148a is up-regulated in NR CLL patients either before and after fludarabine treatment and it was identified also as resistance predictor in pre CLLs. However, its mechanism of action is not clear, as only two gene targets are presently experimentally validated. One is the isoform 1 of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b1) and the other is the pregnane X receptor gene whose repression, in turn, reduces the expression of CYP3A4 enzyme. Our assay revealed that its mechanism of action may not be linked to apoptosis inhibition in resistant patients. Therefore, its role in fludarabine resistance remains unknown. ',\n"," 'This study revealed that a characteristic miRNA expression profile, as assessed before and soon after start of treatment, can discriminate between fludarabine sensitive and fludarabine resistant CLLs. We confirm the importance of a defective p53 pathway in conferring fludarabine resistance. This mechanism may be relevant in affecting miRNA expression; however, we suggest that an aberrant miRNA expression, i.e. up-regulation of miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222 in NRs, may be important in establishing resistance independently from p53, protecting cells from apoptosis. Indeed, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 may increase sensitivity to fludarabine in vitro in a p53-mutant cell line. The differential expression of a small number of miRNAs can have an effect on the capability to respond to fludarabine in CLL patients and can be used for response prediction. Therefore our data may help identify those elderly patients unlikely to respond to fludarabine used as single agent and may assist in the definition of the induction treatment in younger patients, given the availability of non cross-resistant drugs, such as bendamustine. This information may have an impact in the development of personalized therapeutic approaches. Seventeen patients (training set) plus 12 patients (test set) followed at our centre and treated with fludarabine as single agent (25 mg/sqm/day for 5 consecutive days for six courses given at 28 day intervals) were enrolled in this study after obtaining informed consent. The training set patients received fludarabine as first line treatment in 4 cases and as second line treatment after chlorambucil in 13 cases. All the patients had typical morphologic features (i.e. majority of small lymphocytes with clumped chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli) and a high immunophenotypic score (i.e. CD5/CD19+, CD23+, CD22 weak positive, surface immunoglobulin weak+, FMC7-), consistent with an unequivocal diagnosis of CLL. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed as previously described as part of the diagnostic workup before treatment. Response to treatment was defined according to NCI criteria and patients were divided in two groups, i.e. those attaining a clinical response (CR) including partial and complete responders and those who did not respond to treatment (NR). For miRNA/mRNA expression studies, peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were separated to a >97% as previously described. In each patient of the training cohort, cells were collected one day before the start of the first course of fludarabine and on day 5 of treatment. ',\n"," 'In the 12 patients constituting the test set, cells were collected one day before treatment start.

Microarray results were analyzed by using the GeneSpring GX 10 software (Agilent Technologies). Data transformation was applied to set all the negative raw values at 1.0, followed by a Quantile normalization and a log2 transformation. Filters on gene expression were used to keep only the miRNAs/mRNA expressed in at least one sample (flagged as P). Then, samples were grouped in accordance to treatment (pre and post fludarabine) and response to treatment (NR and CR). Differentially expressed genes were selected as having a n-fold expression difference between their geometrical mean among the groups of interest and a statistically significant p-value (<0.05) by Welch t-test statistic. For gene expression statistical analysis, the Benjamini and Hoechberg correction for false positives reduction was used. Differentially expressed genes were employed in Cluster Analysis, using the Manhattan correlation as a measure of similarity and the complete linkage rule for genes and samples clusterization. The identification of mRNAs modulated after fludarabine, in matched samples, was done using the filter on 0-10th percentile in at least 75% of patients, for the miRNAs down-modulated by treatment, and a filter on 90-100th percentile in at least 75% of patients, for the miRNAs up-modulated by treatment.

The amount of target, normalized on U6 RNA amount, was calculated using 2-DeltaCt (Comparative Ct) method as implemented by Biorad Genex macro for excel program. Significance in qRT-PCR results was determined by t-test. Box plot graphs were created using Microsoft Excel program. For miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a, a CR vs NR threshold value was determined by calculating and selecting the first integer number above the 98th percentile of expression values (as described in quantitative RT-PCR method) distribution in CR group. For each miRNA, a score of 0 was assigned when expression was below the threshold and a score of 1 when above. The sum of these scores for the three miRNAs was used to assign patients to one of two classes (CR or NR): for scores 0 to 1, the patient was predicted as CR; for scores 2 to 3, the patient was predicted as NR.

',\n"," 'Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in phase II clinical development for treatment of various forms of cancer. When administered with a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed dosing schedule, flavopiridol exhibited striking activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study aimed to evaluate pharmacogenetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and outcomes associated with flavopiridol therapy. Thirty-five patients who received single-agent flavopiridol via the PK-directed schedule were genotyped for 189 polymorphisms in genes encoding 56 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Genotypes were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as covariates in a population PK model. Transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in uptake assays in HEK-293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1. Polymorphisms in ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and SLCO1B1 were found to significantly correlate with flavopiridol PK in univariate analysis. Transport assay results indicated both flavopiridol and flavopiridol-glucuronide are substrates of the SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 transporter. Covariates incorporated into the final population PK model included bilirubin, SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. Associations were also observed between genotype and response. To validate these findings, a second set of data with 51 patients was evaluated, and overall trends for associations between PK and PGx were found to be consistent. Polymorphisms in transport genes were found to be associated with flavopiridol disposition and outcomes. Observed clinical associations with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated indicating for the first time its relevance as a transporter of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. A second 51-patient dataset indicated similar trends between genotype in the SLCO1B1 and other candidate genes, thus providing support for these findings. Further study in larger patient populations will be necessary to fully characterize and validate the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other transporter and metabolizing enzyme genes on outcomes from flavopiridol therapy. Flavopiridol (Alvocidib, NSC 649890), is a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that broadly targets cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including the cyclin 9/cyclin T complex (pTEF-b), preventing activation of RNA polymerase II. Flavopiridol initiates cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis through down-regulation of Mcl-1 and X-linked inactivator of apoptosis (XIAP) . These preclinical characteristics provided the rationale for clinical investigation of flavopiridol in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as advanced CLL is commonly associated with elevated Mcl-1 and dysfunctional p53, rendering standard treatments such as alkylating agents, fludarabine and rituximab ineffective. Single agent flavopiridol administered with 72-, 24- and 1-hour infusion schedules produced limited activity in hematologic and solid tumor diseases. ',\n"," 'Phase I and II studies using flavopiridol in combination with other agents utilizing the various schedules obtained mixed results, although partial and complete responses in these trials indicated potential synergy of flavopiridol with chemotherapy. We previously reported overall response rates of 40-50% in patients with refractory CLL when flavopiridol was administered as a single agent using a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed schedule. A phase II registration trial is underway for unmet need in refractory CLL patients using this PK-directed schedule. The activity of the PK-directed schedule in CLL, compared to that of the previously evaluated schedules, clearly indicted the importance of flavopiridol PK for clinical activity, and associations were in fact observed between PK and clinical outcomes, including response, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). However, a substantial amount of variability in PK, as well as in response and toxicity, was unexplained by demographic, patient and disease characteristics. We therefore sought to determine the role of pharmacogenetic factors in flavopiridol PK and treatment outcomes within this patient population. Flavopiridol elimination occurs via excretion and metabolism and is known through in vitro studies to be influenced by the multi-drug resistance protein-2 (MRP2, ABCC2) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2), which contribute to biliary excretion of both parent drug and glucuronide metabolites. Glucuronide conjugation to the 5- and 7-hydroxy positions of flavopiridol by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoforms 1A1 and 1A9 (UGT1A1 and UGT1A9, respectively) accounts for the majority of metabolic transformation of flavopiridol. Polymorphic diversity in these and other genes may influence flavopiridol disposition, activity and toxicity in a manner similar to irinotecan disposition. Limited polymorphism effects on flavopiridol interactions have been reported, including a lack of observed effects on clinical PK and in vitro substrate specificity. Although polymorphisms were not directly evaluated by Innocenti and colleagues, their clinical report suggested flavopiridol:metabolite ratio as a possible predictor of diarrhea with flavopiridol treatment and provided a rationale for evaluation of a genetic link with UGT isoforms. In this report, we present pharmacogenetic (PGx) data for drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) in a subset of 35 patients treated in a phase I study of a PK-derived 4.5-hour dosing schedule of single-agent flavopiridol in relapsed CLL. These data comprise a focused analysis of candidate genes known through in vitro studies to interact with flavopiridol, as well as a broader exploratory evaluation of additional DMET genes. ',\n"," 'interact with flavopiridol, as well as a broader exploratory evaluation of additional DMET genes. The results indicate a novel link between flavopiridol PK and SLCO1B1, as well as functional evidence for OATP1B1 (the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 protein product of SLCO1B1) transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. Preliminary analysis of these associations in a second dataset comprising 51 patients provided additional support for the validity of associations between PK, transporter and UGT1A1 genes and their potential clinical relevance. Importantly, pharmacogenetic factors explain a significant portion of inter-patient variability and improves the accuracy of a developing population PK model for this agent. Samples were obtained from patients who provided informed written consent and were enrolled on clinical protocol NCI-5746 (NCT00058240, ClinicalTrials.gov). The sample collection and analyses reported in this study were outlined in the clinical protocol, as approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient demographics and disease characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes and PK results, were reported previously. DNA was obtainable from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 35 of the 52 patients on study. Demographics, baseline labs and disease characteristics for these patients are presented in Table 1. Genes known from in vitro studies to specifically affect flavopiridol disposition include UGT1A1, UGT1A9, ABCC2 and ABCG2. These and an additional set of 52 other genes that code for metabolic enzymes and transporters commonly involved in drug disposition were evaluated for the presence of known polymorphisms by direct sequencing and with a high-throughput SNPlex assay (Applied Biosystems). Genomic DNA was extracted from patient PBMCs and used to sequence promoter TATA box regions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 and specifically to identify the presence of the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*22 polymorphisms. Primers for UGT promoter sequencing were as follows: 1A1-forward, 5\\' - GGAAGTACTTTGCTGTGTTCACTCAAG; 1A1-reverse, 5\\' - AAGGGTCCGTCAGCATGACATCAA; 1A9-forward, 5\\' - CTTAACATTGCAGCACAGGGCATGTT; 1A9-reverse, 5\\' - CGTACTTGTGCTTTCCATTGAGCATGGG.\"] All sequence data was deposited in GenBank. To validate sequence results of the TATA box regions, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) specific primers were used in a fluorescence/gel-migration assay. Polymorphism-specific primers were utilized in the SNPlex assay to identify the presence of 189 other SNPs in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. A complete list of the genes and SNPs evaluated was presented previously. A population PK (popPK) model for 50 patients on study was previously reported. ',\n"," 'This model served as the starting point to evaluate SNPs and other covariates for the subset of 35 patients with PGx data using NONMEM VI (Icon, Hanover, MD). With first order conditional estimation, a base structural model was built with proportional and additive residual error considering both between-subject variability (BSV) and between-occasion variability (BOV) on PK parameters, since PK data was available on two occasions from patients who received escalated doses. Initial screening of the genetic data was completed with the allelic association test in HelixTree software (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT) which produced unadjusted p-values for correlation with each of the base model-predicted PK parameters. Of the 189 SNPs (191 total including the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*29 promoter polymorphisms from direct sequencing), 16 SNPs in 4 genes known previously to interact with flavopiridol (UGT1A1/9, ABCC2 and ABCG2), were retained for further analysis. From the remaining 175 total SNPs in 52 genes that were known to be involved in drug disposition, we filtered out from consideration SNPs with p-values>0.05 and minor allele frequencies less than 0.15. For direct fitting of selected polymorphisms to PK parameters, SNPs were converted to dichotomous categorical variables whereby the heterozygous category (M/m) for the major (M) and minor (m) alleles was combined with either the major or minor allele category as previously reported. Demographic, baseline laboratory covariates, and the total of 43 SNPs from above screening were then introduced with general additive modeling (GAM) and visual inspection of diagnostic plots using R v.2.9.0 and Xpose 4.0.4. These covariates identified by visual inspection and GAM as potentially meaningful (according to the Akaike information criterion, AIC) were introduced into the population model for further evaluation of the SNP associations. Using GAM, four sets of covariates including SNPs were retained for further evaluation in a full structural model. For completeness, each individual covariate was fit to the structural model using the power (equation 1) or fractional change (equation 2) models, where thetai is the individual PK parameter estimate, thetapop is the population parameter estimate for the typical individual, and etai is the sum of BSV and BOV parameters approximately log-normally distributed with standard deviations omega about a mean of 0. ',\n"," 'CONji is the value of the continuous covariate j for individual I, CONj-med is the population median value of covariate j for all individuals, CATji is the value of the categorical covariate j for individual i, and Thetaj is an estimated parameter. All covariates were evaluated in this way with the full 50-patient dataset, except for the SNPs which were evaluated after removal of individuals for whom no genetic data was available. To identify a final multivariate model for all of the PK parameters simultaneously, we used selection methods that depend on changes in the objective function value. Using a cutoff of p<=.05, which corresponded to a minimum decrease of the objective function value (OFV) of 3.84 upon inclusion of each individual covariate based on the likelihood-ratio test, multivariate analysis with forward stepwise inclusion, backward stepwise deletion, and forward selection followed by backward elimination were applied to finalize the covariate model. Model selection in multivariate analysis was based on 1) minimum reduction of OFV by 3.84 (P<=0.05) for forward inclusion, 2) reduction of OFV by 6.64 or greater (P<=0.01) for backward deletion, and 3) decrease in residual error and/or BSV of the evaluated PK parameter. Interaction between covariates was examined by scatter plot of covariate values and change of OFV between models with single or combined covariates. For bias evaluation the final model was fitted to replicate datasets using the bootstrap resampling technique in Wings for NONMEM, and PK parameter estimates and random effects for each of the replicate datasets were obtained. Two hundred replicate bootstrap datasets were generated and used for evaluation of parameter estimate precision. Model precision was evaluated by comparing mean parameter values and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CI) of the replicates with NONMEM outputs. The human SLC01B1 gene was isolated from the HEP-G2 cell line using methods similar to those previously published. Briefly, RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent and each half of the gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pcr-blunt II Topo vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The second half of the gene was digested with NotI and SnaBI and combined with the first half in the pcr-blunt II topo vector. The full length clone was then digested with KpnI and NotI and transferred into pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen). ',\n"," 'Base pairs that were different from the reference sequence (NCBI Genbank ID, BC114376) were mutated using QuickChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) via the manufacturer\\'s protocols to match the reference and non-synonymous polymorphic variant sequences.\"] Gene orientation and homology of reference, rs11045819 (T155P), rs2306283 (D130N), and rs4149056 (V174A) SLCO1B1 SNPs were confirmed through direct full length sequencing of clones prior to experimentation. A list of primers used for cloning, sequencing and mutagenesis (for introduction of nonsynonymous SNPs) is presented in Table 2. Flavopiridol was obtained from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Flavopiridol-glucuronide (flavo-G) was extracted from patient urine and purified. Total urine through 24-hours after the start of flavopiridol dosing was collected from patients enrolled in an IRB-approved phase II protocol (NCI-7000). Octanol extraction followed by C-18 solid phase extraction was employed to isolate flavo-G from flavopiridol and other urine components. To quantify recovered flavo-G and verify purity, samples were incubated with beta-Glucuronidase as previously described and quantified via LC-MS/MS analysis with methods modified from those previously reported. Purity was estimated at >95% via mass and UV chromatography. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK-II) and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 C in Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 microg/ml streptomycin.\"] Plates (24-well) were seeded with 2x105 cells/well and transfected with the reference and polymorphic OATP1B1-containing vectors using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent per the manufacturer\\'s protocols (Roche).\"] Transfection efficiency and gene expression were evaluated with GFP vectors and real-time PCR, respectively. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were dosed with 10 microM flavopiridol or flavo-G in OptiMEM I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) incubation media containing 4% bovine serum albumin for 10 and 30 minutes, respectively, at 37 C. After incubation, cells were washed with 4 C versene, trypsinized, and resuspended in 37 C versene at a total volume of 350 ul. A 150 microL aliquot of the cell suspension was lysed with 30 microl 6% Triton X-100 in PBS, and protein concentration was determined using Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The remaining 200microL cell suspensions were precipitated with 1mL, 4 C acetonitrile containing 200nM genistein, followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min. ',\n"," 'The supernatant (1mL) was removed and dried in a vacuum concentrator then samples were resuspended in 150microL 95:5 water:acetonitrile plus 0.1% acetic acid, vortexed, and centrifuged. Supernatants (100 microL) were analyzed using liquid chromatography and mass spec conditions as described previously. SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, Sigma, St Louis, MO) and lenalidomide (obtained by extraction from donated patient capsules as previously reported) were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Analytical methods for LC-MS/MS quantification lenalidomide was used as previously published. For SN-38 LC-MS/MS quantification, a previously published method was modified and partially validated. Calculated uptake velocities were normalized to total protein in each well, and results were compared against empty vector controls using Student\\'s t-test.\"] To identify associations with genetics, the means of flavopiridol and flavo-G PK parameters were compared based on SNP genotypes using Student\\'s t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\"] For comparisons of PGx and clinical outcomes, SNP genotypes and response or toxicity grading was evaluated using Fisher\\'s exact test.\"] P-values were not further adjusted for multiple testing. DNA of adequate quality and quantity for analysis was available from 35 of the 52 patients treated on study, and both SNPlex and direct sequencing data were generated for these individuals (see Table 1 for demographics and pre-treatment characteristics of this patient subset). In addition to the 4 genes of interest, 17 genes and 27 SNPs met our criteria for further study (see Table 3). Among these, SLCO1B1 was selected for further evaluation given its known physiological relevance for a broad set of drugs and its potential role of transporting flavopiridol into liver for subsequent metabolism and excretion. A total of 577 plasma concentration-time values from 50 of 52 patients in the clinical study were included for PK data analysis using two-compartmental kinetics with first-order elimination, as described previously. Based on this previous analysis, BSV was initially assumed on each parameter in the model. However, removal of BSV for V1 did not significantly change OFV (increase of 1 unit). After removal of BSV on V1, addition of BOV on single or multiple parameters was tested in the model. Addition of BOV on clearance (CL) resulted in the most significant change in OFV. The final base model thus included BSV on CL, inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and volume of peripheral compartment (V2), and BOV on CL. Base model parameter estimates and random effects are presented in Table 4. ',\n"," 'Demographic and lab covariates from GAM screening were subsequently evaluated in the base model with univariate analysis (see Table 5). With the modified random error in the base model, bilirubin was indicated as the most significant covariate with a direct positive effect on Q. Addition of bilirubin decreased OFV by 8.07 and BSV (on Q) from 63.64% to 55.41% (see Figure 1). To evaluate genetic covariates, the dataset was reduced by removing patients for whom no genetic data was available. This reduced the dataset from 50 to 35 subjects and from 577 to 388 records. Univariate analysis on genetic covariates with this dataset identified the 14 most significant covariate-parameter relationships (see Table 6). Using the selection methods discussed above, we retained in all of the final models SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. The relationships between these SNPs and their respective base model-estimated PK parameters are displayed in Figure 2. Although associations between PK and SNPs in ABCC2 may have been expected due to known in vitro interactions of MRP2 and flavopiridol, no such evidence existed prior to this study for the role of SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 in flavopiridol transport. To determine if the observed associations between flavopiridol PK and SLCO1B1 PGx were functionally relevant for flavopiridol disposition, we measured uptake of flavopiridol and flavo-G in cells transfected with SLCO1B1. Transfection efficiencies were estimated at approximately 60% using GFP-containing control vectors. Mean uptake velocities were 261+-12 fmol/mg protein/10 min and 38+-10 fmol/mg protein/30 min for flavopiridol and flavo-G, respectively, in MDCK-II cells. Flavopiridol transport rates in HEK-293 cells were approximately 2-3 fold higher than in MDCK-II cells suggesting its transport may be affected by the different membrane and transporter compositions in the two cell lines. Flavo-G transport rates were similar in both cell lines. Figure 3 shows normalized uptake velocities of flavopiridol and flavo-G in both HEK293 and MDCK-II cells transfected with either SLCO1B1 or empty vector. Expression of the transfected SLCO1B1 gene was verified with real-time PCR (data not shown). Functional expression of OATP1B1 was verified by evaluating uptake of a positive control substrate, SN-38. A second agent, lenalidomide, was used as a negative control substrate. Total intracellular accumulation and Initial transport velocities of SN-38, flavopiridol, and flavo-G were significantly increased in HEK293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1, compared to empty control vectors, whereas no increased uptake was shown for lenalidomide. ',\n"," 'We further evaluated the uptake of flavopiridol in MDCK-II cells transfected with the SLCO1B1 polymorphic variants with amino acid changes relative to the reference sequence (i.e. nonsynonymous SNPs). These included rs11045819 (T155P), rs2306283 (D130N), and rs4149056 (V174A). The results indicated significant decreases in flavopiridol transport rates (t-test p-value<0.05) for the rs11045819 and rs4149056 variants, but the transport rate of the rs2306283 polymorph was similar to that in the reference SLCO1B1 transporter. Figure 4 displays these results. To arrive at a final model with significant PGx, lab and demographic covariates, the reduced data set was used to reevaluate the demographic and lab covariates retained after univariate analysis with the full dataset (see Table 6). Bilirubin effect on Q was apparent and remained the most significant demographic or lab covariate with the reduced dataset. However, significant effects of blood urea nitrogen on CL and alanine aminotransferase on V2 that were observed in the full dataset disappeared with use of the reduced dataset. The remaining four significant demographic or lab covariates and the two significant SNPs (SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710) were then evaluated by forward addition and backward deletion. Only the two SNPs and bilirubin were retained as significant covariates with the reduced dataset. Relative to the base model, the final model displayed an OFV reduction of 34.11. Table 7 lists the final model parameter estimates. The bootstrap method was used to assess bias in the final covariate model. From the reduced data set, 200 replicate data sets were generated and used for the evaluation of the stability of the final covariate model. Table 8 lists the results of the bootstrap procedure, presented as mean and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals of the parameter estimates and random effects of the final model. Mean estimated parameter values from the bootstrap were within 11% of the parameter estimates of the original data set indicating reliability in the developed model. Flavo-G PK parameter estimates reported previously in 27 pts on study were evaluated to identify PGx associations. The trends observed indicated that fewer TA repeats in the UGT1A1 promoter were weakly associated with lower flavo-G Cmax (2.17+/-0.99 vs. 5.08+/-4.12 microM) and AUC (26.43+/-30.26 vs. 66.16+/-64.37 hr* microM) (p = .057 and .077, respectively). Only two transporter SNPs were associated with flavo-G PK. ',\n"," 'The SLCO1B1 rs2306283 SNP correlated with flavo-G plasma concentrations (the total time in hours flavo-G concentrations were below 1.5 microM, p = .019), and the ABCG2 rs1564481 SNP was associated with flavo-G AUC (p = .050). We also evaluated flavopiridol AUC with respect to PGx, and one trend was observed with the ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP (p = 0.08). Bilirubin levels were not associated with SNPs in UGT1A1, but the SLCO1B1 rs3829310 minor C allele was associated with higher baseline bilirubin (p = .011). These relationships are presented in Figure 5. To determine if the presence of polymorphisms was significantly associated with outcomes, clinical response and the primary toxicities (TLS, diarrhea and CRS) were evaluated against PGx. Results indicated SNPs in SLCO1B1 and ABCG2, but not in UGT1A1/9 or ABCC2, were associated with response. SNPs significantly associated with improved response included the SCLO1B1 rs11045819 (CC genotype, p = .041) and ABCG2 rs1564481 (T allele, p = .037). The SLCO1B1 rs2306283 SNP alone did not meet the significance criteria (T allele, p = .061), but the combination of this and the SLCO1B1 rs11045819 SNP was significant (p = .007). No SNPs met the significance criteria when compared against TLS, although the most closely associated SNP was SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (C allele, p = .056). Similaraly, the most closely associated SNPs with diarrhea and CRS were SCLO1B1 rs2306283 (T allele, p = .055) and ABCG2 rs1564481 (T allele, p = .074). To evaluate the validity of the findings from the 35-patient dataset, a second dataset was evaluated for associations between PGx and PK. The validation set comprised data from 66 CLL patients who were treated with the same flavopiridol dosing regimen in a separate phase II study (NCI-7000, NCT00098371). As with the phase I study, enrolled patients provided informed written consent, and plasma and PBMC samples were obtained according to The Ohio State University IRB approved protocol. Clinical results of this study were reported previously. Plasma and DNA samples from this study were analyzed using the methods described above to generate flavopiridol and flavo-G concentration-time data, PK parameter estimates, and PGx data for each patient. Covariates found to be significantly associated in univariate analysis with the phase I dataset, including demographic and baseline laboratory covariates and SNPs in UGT1A1, ABCC2, ABCG2 and SLCO1B1, were compared with the phase II pharmacokinetic data. Significant associations and trends were observed with the validation dataset. ',\n"," 'For flavopiridol PK, these included significant associations between the SCLO1B1 rs2306283 SNP and Q (p = 0.02) and between both the ABCG2 rs2622624 and rs3114018 SNPs and CL and V1 (rs2622624, p = 0.008 and 0.04; rs3114018, p = 0.004 and 0.006 for CL and V1, respectively). The SLCO1B1 rs3829310 SNP was weakly associated with flavopiridol CL and AUC (p = 0.08 and 0.08, respectively). The ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP showed a similar trend with AUC (p = .08). For flavo-G, significant associations included Cmax and AUC with the UGT1A1*28 promotor SNP (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Bilirubin levels were significantly associated with the SLCO1B1 rs3829310 and SLCO1B1 rs2291075 SNPs (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). Figure 6 displays a subset of these relationships. Safe and effective use of flavopiridol will require a thorough understanding of the factors influencing the onset of hyper-acute tumor lysis syndrome and inter-individual variability in response. We previously reported that at least some of the variability in outcomes may be explained by PK, yet significant portions of this variability remain unexplained. In this first evaluation of pharmacogenetics using the flavopiridol PK-derived schedule, we identified a novel flavopiridol-transporter interaction and confirmed its functional relevance in vitro. Furthermore, a subset of the polymorphisms evaluated in this study was significantly associated with outcomes. The striking activity of this dosing schedule in CLL and flavopiridol\\'s emerging activity with combination chemotherapy in other diseases demand these pharmacogenetic and other factors be identified and further characterized.\"] To expand on our previous evaluation of flavopiridol using the PK-directed schedule, we sought to characterize the role of PGx in flavopiridol disposition. We combined focused and exploratory approaches, whereby PK data from a phase I dataset was evaluated against SNPs in candidate genes previously shown to metabolize or transport flavopiridol in in vitro studies, as well as SNPs in genes not known to interact with flavopiridol. The candidate genes evaluated included ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. Indeed, at least one SNP in each of these genes was significantly associated in univariate analysis with flavopiridol and flavo-G PK. In multivariate analysis with the phase I dataset, a single SNP in ABCC2 (rs8187710) remained significant. This is a non-synonymous SNP resulting in a C1515Y alteration and is part of a haplotype with the rs17222723 SNP (also a non-synonymous SNP with a V1188E residue change). ',\n"," 'This haplotype has been reported to be associated with PBMC accumulation of lopinavir, susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This is a relatively infrequent SNP, and only 5 of 35 and 4 of 51 individuals were genotyped for the polymorphic A allele in the phase I and II datasets, respectively. Significant associations between this SNP and PK parameters were not observed in the phase II dataset. Although UGT1A1 SNPs were not included in the final popPK model, both flavopiridol and flavo-G were correlated with the UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism, and fewer TA repeats (6 and 7) were associated with lower flavo-G concentrations and AUC in both the phase I and II datasets. One of the most broadly studied substrates of UGT1A1 and 1A9 is irinotecan/SN-38, which shares metabolic pathways and has a similar toxicity profile (diarrhea) with flavopiridol. Interestingly, the *3 polymorphism of 1A9 was previously shown to be associated with SN-38 but not flavopiridol disposition. Innocenti and colleagues measured ratios of flavo-G:flavopiridol and identified an indirect relationship between flavo-G levels and diarrhea. Zhai and colleagues reported PK and UGT1A1 polymorphism data in 49 patients with refractory neoplasms treated with 1-hour IV flavopiridol. However, their results indicated no correlation of the TATA box promoter UGT1A1*28 genotype with flavopiridol PK or diarrhea severity. While we did not identify correlations with diarrhea for flavopiridol and flavo-G PK, we observed one association with PGx and diarrhea. The 35-patient dataset evaluated in this study was small with regard to exploratory PGx, and therefore an additional dataset from 51 patients was used to evaluate the validity of the findings. While the associations identified in each dataset were not identical, similar trends were observed between PK parameters and SNPs in the candidate genes. Furthermore, the clinical associations we observed with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated in vitro. SLCO1B1 is important for the disposition of statin drugs and various anti-cancer agents including irinotecan. It was recently highlighted by the International Transporter Consortium as one of the seven most relevant transporters for drug development due to its broad substrate specificity, potential for drug-drug interactions, and clinically relevant polymorphisms. Importantly, functional transport data indicated this gene may play a role in hepatic uptake of both flavopiridol and flavo-G. ',\n"," 'All five of the SLCO1B1 SNPs evaluated in the phase I dataset were significant in univariate analysis, and two of these (rs11045819 on V1 and rs4149056 on CL) were the strongest associations observed of any covariates evaluated for flavopiridol PK in multivariate analysis. These are non-synonymous SNPs affecting the amino acid sequence in OATP1B1. Previous studies indicated these variants were associated with reduced uptake activity of the OATP1B1 substrates estrone-3-sulfate, estradiol-17beta-d-glucuronide, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, pravastatin, the SN-38 metabolite of irinotecan and rifampicin in. These reports are consistent with our in vitro data which indicated these SNPs significantly reduced flavopiridol transport, while the other nonsynonymous SNP evaluated (rs2306283) had no measureable effect. Interestingly, this was the only SLCO1B1 SNP significantly associated with flavo-G PK. A recently reported study in MDCK-II cells with this SNP indicated increased transport of bromosulfophthalein and decreased transport of cholyltaurine. Collectively, the data may suggest that the altered protein sequence affects OATP1B1 transport of flavopiridol and flavo-G differently. Further in vitro evaluations of these and other SNPs will be required to characterize their functional impact with respect to flavopiridol and flavo-G disposition. Additionally, the data presented suggests flavopridol may be a weak substrate of SLCO1B1 in comparison with SN-38 under the evaluated experimental conditions. However, characterization of the kinetics of flavopiridol and flavo-G transport via SLCO1B1 will be necessary for understanding the full impact this gene has on overall flavopiridol disposition. The observed associations between PGx and outcomes in this study are encouraging as potential indicators for patient response. While no SNP met the significance criteria for association with TLS, the polymorphism most closely associated with this toxicity was SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (ANOVA p = .056). The strength of the associations between PK, outcomes and multiple SNPs in SLCO1B1 and the confirmation of functional OATP1B1 transport of both flavopiridol and flavo-G support the potential for this gene to be clinically relevant in patients receiving flavopiridol treatment. Overall, analysis of the phase II dataset revealed significant associations with the candidate genes that were supportive of the findings from the phase I dataset. In particular, trends in flavopiridol AUC with respect to the ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP and flavo-G Cmax and AUC with respect to the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism were strikingly similar between the two datasets (see Figures 5 and 6). Again, further validation of these associations will be essential in larger datasets. ',\n"," 'This work modifies and develops further our previously reported population model for the PK-directed schedule of flavopiridol. We demonstrate the most significant covariates in the phase I dataset to be polymorphisms in two transporter genes, SCLO1B1 and ABCC2, and the phase II validation set revealed significant associations with polymorphisms in ABCG2. While larger data sets are necessary to fully characterize the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other genes on flavopiridol PK, our findings are supportive of a clinically significant role for PGx in flavopiridol disposition. The composite data to date suggests inter-individual variability in outcomes from flavopiridol therapy will be due to a combination of pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and potentially other factors related to tumor cell sensitivity to flavopiridol\\'s cytotoxic effects.\"] Inter-individual variability is of particular concern for chemotherapeutic drugs with relatively narrow therapeutic windows. The developing model for flavopiridol PK may ultimately help to explain this variability by incorporating pharmacogenetic and other significant factors. With sufficient data and validation, this model may ultimately serve as a tool for predicting PK and associated outcomes in individuals prior to therapy. If sufficiently robust, such a tool would be clinically useful in identifying individuals likely to respond and/or experience severe TLS or other toxicities upon receiving flavopiridol. ',\n"," '.

Thus, in this study we tested the activity of dasatinib in patients with relapsed CLL. Patients were eligible for this phase 2 trial if they had documented CLL/SLL and had failed at least one prior therapy with a fludarabine-containing regimen and if they required therapy according to NCI-WG criteria. The starting dose of dasatinib was 140 mg daily. Fifteen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 59 and a median of 3 prior regimens. All patients had received fludarabine, and 5 were fludarabine-refractory. Eleven of the 15 (73%) had high risk del(11q) or del(17p) cytogenetics. The primary toxicity was myelosuppression, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 10 and 6 patients, respectively. Partial responses by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI 6-44). Among the remaining 12 patients, 5 had nodal responses by physical exam, and 1 patient had a nodal and lymphocyte response but with severe myelosuppression. Pharmacodynamic studies indicated apoptosis in peripheral blood CLL cells within 3-6 hours after dasatinib administration, associated with downregulation of syk mRNA. Dasatinib as a single agent has activity in relapsed and refractory CLL. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the Western world and remains incurable outside of the bone marrow transplant setting. While the median survival for all newly diagnosed patients is over 10 years, there is significant patient to patient variability. For patients who relapse after initial treatment, survival varies from about 3 years in good risk patients treated aggressively to 9-13 months in fludarabine-refractory patients. The reasons for progression and treatment resistance are currently under intensive investigation. CLL cells are believed to proliferate and escape apoptosis in large part from signal pathways originating from the B-cell receptor (BCR). Although the precise mechanisms likely differ between heavy chain mutated and unmutated CLLs, in both forms of the disease Src family kinases (SFKs) are overexpressed, are aberrantly located in the cytosol outside of lipid rafts, and appear to play a crucial role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. In unmutated CLL cells, the signaling from the BCR follows a pattern similar to that in normal B-cells. ',\n"," 'These cells respond to antigen engagement with translocation of the BCR to lipid rafts, where the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located in the intracellular tails of the BCR become phosphorylated by the SFK Lyn. The BCR then phosphorylates Syk kinase, resulting in downstream activation of PI3K, Akt and Mcl-1 as well as MEK/ERK. These events result in enhanced proliferation and survival. In mutated CLL cells, little response to BCR engagement is seen, and no migration of the BCR to lipid rafts is seen. Instead, these cells show constitutive activation of Lyn kinase outside lipid rafts in the cytosol with continual signaling of proliferation and survival pathways. In both mutated and unmutated CLL cells, inhibition of Lyn kinase by selective inhibitors enhanced apoptosis of these cells in vitro through a caspase-dependent mechanism, further demonstrating the key role of Lyn in CLL. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor derived from an aminothiazole scaffold and was originally developed as a pan-Src kinase inhibitor. Once dasatinib was found to bind Abl with an affinity over 100 times that of imatinib mesylate, its development focused on CML, with successful clinical trials leading to its FDA approval in 2006 for the treatment of CML resistant to imatinib. However, dasatinib also inhibits Lyn kinase in vitro with an IC50 of 11 nM, similar to the 1-10 nM IC50 of dasatinib for BCR-ABL. The inhibition of Lyn kinase by dasatinib has been tested in K562 cell lines resistant to imatinib mesylate, and in these cells, apoptosis correlated with inhibition of Lyn phosphorylation. Dasatinib has been extensively studied in CML, initially at doses of 35 mg to 70 mg BID. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the peak concentration of dasatinib occurred at approximately 2 hours while the half life was approximately 5 hours. Dasatinib was well tolerated. In a Phase I trial of dasatinib, CML cells from patients resistant to imatinib mesylate showed rapid and sustained inhibition of Lyn kinase. With the understanding that Lyn kinase may be critical for CLL survival, and given Lyn could be inhibited by dasatinib at tolerable doses, we initiated this phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The use of 140 mg once daily was chosen due to emerging data that the once daily schedule was potentially less toxic and at least as effective in patients with CML. ',\n"," '2 study of dasatinib given once daily to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. The study was undertaken from 2007 to 2008 at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, institutions of the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. The primary objective of the study was to determine the overall response rate by NCI-WG criteria. Secondary objectives were to determine the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, spectrum of toxicities, and pharmacodynamic studies to demonstrate Lyn kinase inhibition and caspase activation by dasatinib in peripheral blood CLL cells. Eligible patients needed to have relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, defined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, with an immunophenotype positive for CD5, CD19, and CD23, with the exception that patients with CD23 negative cells could be eligible as long as cyclin D1 staining was also negative (ruling out mantle cell lymphoma). Patients needed to be at least 18 years of age, have failed at least 1 prior fludarabine containing regimen or at least 2 non-fludarabine containing regimens, have an ECOG performance status of 2 or better, creatinine <3.0 mg/dl, SGOT <3 x ULN (upper limit of normal), ANC >1,000/ul, platelets >50,000/ul, and reticulocyte count <10%. Patients were required to be in need of treatment according to NCI-WG guidelines. Women were excluded if pregnant, breast-feeding, or unwilling to use an acceptable form of contraception if of child-bearing potential. Additional exclusion criteria included uncontrolled angina, a prolonged QT interval at baseline (QTc >450 ms), clinically significant arrhythmias, significant hypertension, or known HIV infection. Drugs known to interfere with platelet function had to be stopped at least 7 days prior to starting dasatinib. The institutional review board of the participating institutions (Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center IRB) approved this study and provided oversight for the duration of the trial. The data were analyzed primarily by P.C.A., E.C.A., D.N., L.W., and J.R.B, but all authors had access to the primary clinical trial data. The clinical trial registration number and name are NCT00438854 and \"Dasatinib in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\". All patients were required to give written informed consent, and the trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients began protocol treatment with a starting daily oral dose of dasatinib of 140 mg (a combination of two 20 mg and two 50 mg pills) and could continue treatment for up to 24 months if responding and without significant toxicity. ',\n"," 'Dasatinib was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Treatment was intended to be continuous, with no planned rest period or breaks. Non-hematologic toxicities were graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3.0, and hematologic toxicities according to the 1996 NCI-WG guidelines. In the event of unacceptable toxicity, defined as any grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicity or any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity, the treatment was held until resolution of the toxicity to grade 1 or less. According to the degree of toxicity, drug could be re-instituted at the same dose or with a dose reduction to 100 mg or 80 mg daily. If the 80 mg daily dose was not tolerated, the patient was taken off protocol due to toxicity. Supportive measures such as blood product support and growth factor administration were allowed at the discretion of the treating physician, with no prophylactic anti-infective therapy mandated. Patients with progression of disease were removed from study. Prior to study treatment, patients underwent the following baseline evaluations: history, physical exam (nodes measured by ruler), complete blood count (CBC), chemistries, liver function tests, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in women, ECG, CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics with analysis by FISH for del(11q), +12, del(13q), and del(17p). Expression of ZAP70 by CLL cells was determined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. In the first month of treatment, CBC, chemistries, and liver function tests were performed at least weekly along with ECGs to assess the QTc interval. For the first 6 months, similar laboratory studies were required at least monthly along with an ECG for QTc assessment. At 2 month intervals up to the 6-month time-point, CT scans were repeated to help assess their impact on response (though not required for NCI-WG criteria). Also at the 2-month time point, a bone marrow biopsy was performed on all patients as a part of response assessment. After 6 months, CT scans were required every 6 months. A bone marrow biopsy was required to confirm a clinical CR or at the time of disease progression, but was not required if patients were removed from the study due to other reasons such as toxicity. ',\n"," \"For a subset of patients who consented to participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study, plasma samples were obtained prior to the first dose of dasatinib and at 3, 6 and 24 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of dasatinib were measured as previously described. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients at baseline, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours after the first dose of dasatinib and prior to day 8 of therapy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were enriched by depleting non-lymphoid cells using the RosetteSep Human B Cell Enrichment Cocktail (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). For analysis of apoptosis, samples of enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes (EPBLs) were stained with anti-Caspase 3 antibody-FITC (Beckton Dickinson) and then fixed in paraformaldehyde and ethanol. Tunel staining was performed using the APO-BRDU Tunel Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), except that anti-BRDU-Alexa Fluor 488 was replaced with anti-BRDU-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). For analysis of protein and phosphoprotein levels, EPBLs were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Sigma). The total protein concentration was identified using the BSA kit (Peirce). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for detection of phophoprotein levels. For p-Lyn, the human phospho-Lyn (Y397) DuoSet IC (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) kit was utilized using 2 ug of total protein lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions. For p-Syk, an ELISA plate was coated with rabbit anti-human p-Syk primary capture antibody (Cell Signaling) and the plate was blocked with BSA. A total of 2 ug of total protein sample lysate was incubated and the plate washed. A mouse anti-human Syk antibody (Sigma) was then added followed by goat anti-mouse biotin and, then streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (both from R & D Systems). The plates were read colorimetrically and the amount of phosphoprotein was expressed as a ratio to the total protein concentration. RNA from EPBLs was extracted, processed, and applied to Affymetrix Human Plus 2.0 microarrays according to standard protocol. Nucleic acid quality was confirmed using gel electrophoresis. The primary objective of this phase II study was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL treated with dasatinib. The primary measures of efficacy of tumor response were: complete remission (CR), nodular partial remission (nPR), or partial remission (PR), as per NCI-WG criteria. \",\n"," 'The true ORR is reported as percentage and 90% CI calculated using the binomial exact test. Patient clinical characteristics are summarized using numbers and percentages for categorical variables, median and range for continuous variables. Duration of on study time was defined from the date patients went on study to the date they were taken off study. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined from the date on study to date of progression, death in remission, initiation of non-protocol therapy in the absence of progression, or censored on the last visit if patients are still on study. Time to progression (TTP) was defined from the time of on study to the date of progression or censored on the off study date if patients had stopped the study. Patients still on study at the time of manuscript preparation were censored at the last visit date. OS was defined from the date on study to date of death or censored on the last visit if patients were still alive as the time of analysis. The method of Kaplan-Meier was used to summarize duration of on study, time to progression, time to treatment failure, and overall survival from the date of on study. In order to identify the differences between gene expression levels of pre and post treatment genes among patients 2 and 3, we first normalized the data at median, then specified the two comparison groups. The threshold of coefficient variation (standard deviation/mean) was set at 1 and 1000 for lower and upper limit as filtering criteria and gene probes differentially expressed at a level of significance (p<.05) were identified. Among the 15 patients enrolled between January 2007 and June 2008 (Table 1), there were 10 male and 5 female subjects with a median age of 59 years (40-78 years). Most were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and had advanced stage disease (7 with Rai stage 3 or 4). All patients had previously received fludarabine, and 5 patients were refractory. Pretreatment bone marrow biopsies demonstrated extensive infiltration (50-95% replacement) with CLL cells in 14 of the 15 patients. By cytogenetic/FISH analysis, there were 3 patients with del(17p), 5 patients with del(11q), and an additional patient with both del(17p) and del(11q). ZAP-70 expression was analyzed in all patients, and 10 patients were classified as positive with >50% expression, while the other 5 patients demonstrated low ZAP-70 expression. ',\n"," 'All 15 treated patients were evaluable for toxicity, and hematological toxicities were frequently encountered (Table 2). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (ANC <1,000/ul) occurred in 10 patients. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (NCI-WG criteria) occurred in 6 patients, but there were no bleeding events reported. Overall, myelosuppression was quite variable among the 15 patients, and 5 were removed from study within 4 months due to this toxicity rather than progression of disease. Two grade 3 infections were observed, both pneumonias that resolved with supportive care, and there were no grade 4 or 5 infections. The other most common non-hematologic toxicities encountered were nausea and fatigue, primarily grades 1 and 2 (Table 2). Four patients developed pleural effusions, which were transient and easily managed by holding the dasatinib and/or using diuretics and steroids. One patient had grade 4 cardiac toxicity due to an asymptomatic QTc of 516 ms, which resolved with repletion of potassium and magnesium. The one grade 4 renal toxicity was a serum potassium of 9.9 mmol/L that was spurious due to leukocytosis, as has been previously reported. For 11 of the 15 patients, study drug was interrupted at some point due to toxicity, with a median duration of interruption of 1.5 weeks with a range of 0 to 8 weeks. Partial responses (PR) by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI 6-44%). Among the 15 patients, 9 (60%) had nodal responses (2 CR and 7 PR) by physical exam (PE), 5 without a 50% reduction in lymphocytosis (see complete table provided as supplemental data). CT scans confirmed a 50% reduction of all nodal and extranodal masses in 4 of the patients (Figure 1), with the other 5 showing less than 50% reduction. The 4 patients with 50% reduction in blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) also had at least 50% nodal responses, but 1 of these patients had severe myelosuppression such that the response could not be counted as a partial response by NCI-WG criteria. The blood responses tended to show both patterns of early and late improvement in lymphocytosis, with response within 7 days in one patient and ongoing improvement after 6 months in others (data not shown). The median duration on study was 14 weeks. ',\n"," 'Ten patients came off study prior to 12 months, 3 of these with progression and 4 due to toxicity, while 3 withdrew consent without progression or significant toxicity. At 12 months, 5 patients remained on study with one starting to progress but the other 4 continuing on treatment in response or with stable disease. The median TTF was 6.7 months. A total of 14 patients experienced treatment failure. Of the 14 patients, 10 of them had disease progression and 4 of them initiated new treatment without progression of disease. The median time to disease progression was 7.5 months. A total of 10 patients experienced disease progression and the rest were censored on the date off study (Figure 2). The median OS of all patients is 27 months. Of the 15 patients, 9 of them have died. Analysis of ALC and lymph node responses showed that for the 5 patients with del(11q), 3 had a blood response and 5 had a nodal response. In fact, two of the three patients achieving NCI WG PR had del(11q). One of the 5 patients with del(17p) responded in lymph nodes but not in blood. Analysis of response by ZAP-70 status showed no clear pattern. Among the 10 ZAP-70 positive patients 1 responded in blood and 5 responded in lymph nodes. One of the 3 patients to respond according to NCI-WG responses was ZAP-70 positive. The pharmacokinetics of dasatinib varied widely among the 3 patients tested, with the 3-hour level in plasma ranging from 19 to 112 ng/ml (see table provided as supplemental data). As expected given the five hour half-life of dasatinib, the 6-hour levels were far below the 3-hour levels, and the 24-hour trough levels were almost undetectable in all three patients. Using staining for TUNEL and activated caspase 3, apoptosis was seen in all three patients assessed, with maximal apoptosis 6 hours after dasatinib (Figure 3, and data not shown for caspase 3). While patient 1 had modest apoptosis, apoptosis was dramatic in 15-20% of enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients 2 and 3. Also within these three patients, we utilized Elisa to determine if levels of Lyn, p-Lyn, Syk, and p-Syk varied in the hours after taking dasatinib. Patients 1 and 3 had relatively low levels of p-Lyn relative to patient 2 prior to dasatinib (Figure 4). ',\n"," 'While levels of p-Lyn remained low in patients 1 and 3, the elevated p-Lyn in patient 2 decreased dramatically after dasatinib. Conversely, p-Syk levels, which were similar in all three patients prior to dosing, increased in patients 1 and 3 and slightly decreased in patient 2 following dasatinib. Of note, patient 2 had a partial response, while patients 1 and 3 did not experience clinical responses (see the associated ALC response at Day 8 provided at the bottom of Figure 4). Finally, the levels of Lyn kinase, p-Lyn, Syk, and p-Syk were compared at baseline and Day 8 of therapy. No association of baseline levels, or change between baseline and Day 8 levels, was seen with clinical response (data not shown). In order to gain biologic insight into whether a dasatinib-induced change in transcriptional program was associated with the brisk apoptosis seen in patients 2 and 3, microarray gene expression profiling was conducted in EPBLs (enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes) and the expression of genes compared in samples obtained before and 6 hours after taking dasatinib. We identified 123 probe sets, corresponding with 106 genes, which were differentially expressed. Of these,102 probe sets were significantly downregulated and 16 probe sets were significantly upregulated in EPBLs 6 hours after taking dasatinib. Functional annotation analysis of genes was performed using the interface DAVID of the National Institutes of Health. The 102 probe sets which were downregulated corresponded to 92 genes. Within the categories of lymphocyte activation/differentiation and leukocyte activation, the genes spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), FK506 binding protein, early growth response 1 (EGR1), NLR family CARD 3, and Notch 2 were significantly (p < .05) downregulated (gene array provided as a supplemental figure). The 16 upregulated probe sets corresponded to 14 unique genes. Among these, the genes GNAS1 and NFKB2 were significantly (p < .05) upregulated (gene array provided as a supplemental figure). Here we report the first full study of dasatinib in CLL, although a case report has recently been published that shows a complete response in a patient treated with single-agent dasatinb. This phase 2 study of single-agent dasatinib in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL demonstrated 3 partial responses by NCI-WG criteria among 15 patients treated. Overall 9 patients had shrinkage of lymph nodes or extranodal masses to less than 50% of their original size, and 4 patients had reduction of ALC by >50%. ',\n"," 'Dasatinib clearly has activity in relapsed CLL/SLL, and responses occurred in subgroups with poor prognostic indicators, particularly those with del(11q). Less activity was observed in patients with del(17p), and although 75% of patients were ZAP-70 positive, only 1 in 3 responders was ZAP-70 positive, suggesting that activity may be better in ZAP-70 negative patients. The small numbers in these subgroups make conclusions difficult, and subsequent studies with greater numbers of patients should reveal any true associations. Dasatinib was reasonably well tolerated in this group of patients. The toxicity most frequently encountered was myelosuppression, with 10 patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred, but bleeding was not a problem, and both myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia resolved promptly after holding the drug. A lower dose of dasatinib or intermittent dosing might reduce the myelosuppression observed. Two patients did require treatment for grade 3 infections but these were easily managed and not unexpected given the patient population. The only other notable toxicities were nausea, pleural effusions, and fatigue. The nausea could be treated with anti-emetics, and the pleural effusions resolved with dose interruptions, diuretics, and steroids. The fatigue generally was mild and tolerable. The greater activity of dasatinib in lymph nodes was not expected but welcome, since patients with advanced refractory disease often have significant lymphadenopathy and few treatment options. The reason for this increased activity in nodes is unclear but several possible explanations exist. Dasatinib may preferentially target proliferating CLL cells which are characteristically found in lymph nodes compared to blood. Another possible explanation is that dasatinib interferes with stromal support of CLL cells in lymph nodes. The mechanisms of stromal support in CLL are complex and multifactorial. For example, it has been established that B-cell survival is enhanced by CD40 signaling. CD40 is a transmembrane receptor that interacts with CD40 ligand present on CD4+ lymphocytes in lymph nodes, and this interaction results in the activation of PI3K and PLCgamma2 followed by the up-regulation of NF-KB and other anti-apoptotic mediators such as survivin, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The intracellular mediator of CD40 signaling is Lyn kinase, and it may be that the inhibition of Lyn by dasatinib interrupts this pathway of stromal support. ',\n"," 'More compelling is a report of an in vitro model which mimics nodal biology, where CD40 stimulation results in relative resistance to chemotherapy agents such as fludarabine through up-regulation in CLL cells of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1, all anti-apoptotic proteins. In this model, exposure to dasatinib completely prevented the entire anti-apoptotic program and rendered the CLL cells sensitive to fludarabine despite concurrent CD40 stimulation. Hence, dasatinib inhibition of Lyn may be particularly important in lymph node biology, and may show greater activity as a chemotherapy sensitizer in combination therapy. To date, the testing of dasatinib in combination with other drugs in CLL has only been performed in vitro, but these reports have been favorable. In one report, CLL cells from patients were treated in vitro with dasatinib, fludarabine, or in combination. Whereas modest apoptosis was seen with each agent alone, combination treatment with both agents enhanced apoptosis by 50%. Dasatinib led to global inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation with down regulation of Akt, ERK1 or 2, MAPK, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and p38. A similar result was demonstrated in a second report, which showed that CLL cells resistant to fludarabine or chlorambucil become sensitive to these agents when also exposed to dasatinib. It seems apparent that, while dasatinib alone may not consistently initiate apoptosis in all CLL cells, the drug clearly inhibits survival pathways that become critical for CLL cells after attack by more conventional chemotherapy agents. The current trial was originally based on the understanding that dasatinib, at concentrations achievable in humans, inhibits Lyn kinase which is overexpressed in CLL and mediates signal transduction from the BCR to downstream effector molecules. To understand the activity of dasatinib further, we investigated levels of p-Lyn and p-Syk and the subsequent apoptosis of EPBLs in a subset of our patients. We were able to demonstrate among 3 patients studied, that one patient had constitutive Lyn phosphorylation that decreased after dasatinib, while the other two patients showed minimal change in levels of p-Lyn. In the patient in whom Lyn was inhibited, no p-Syk was seen and a clinical PR was observed. The other two patients, both of whom showed increased p-Syk following dasatinib dosing, did not show clinical responses. These results are consistent with a recent report that CLL cells exposed to dasatinib in vitro demonstrate widespread p-Lyn inhibition but undergo apoptosis only when p-Syk and PLCgamma2 are also inhibited. ',\n"," \"Interestingly, we identified changes in the transcriptional program of EPBLs associated with apoptosis after dasatinib exposure. Among the genes that underwent downregulation were SYK, which is implicated in lymphocyte signaling and survival and for which inhibitors are currently under clinical study in CLL, FK506BP, which modulates the apoptotic signal of TGF-beta in CLL, EGR1, whose expression is associated with survival in CLL, NLR Card 3, which is downregulated 6 hrs following T-lymphocyte stimulation, and Notch 2, which similarly undergoes downregulation in CLL cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, genes which were upregulated included GNAS1, whose T393C polymorphism has been correlated with prognosis in CLL in one study but not in another. Also, NFKB2, which upregulates the anti-apoptotic bcl-2, was upregulated following exposure to dasatinib and may indicate the cell's molecular attempt to evade apoptosis. Our in vitro results can only be considered suggestive, and further studies need to be done to clarify the relationships between apoptosis and the various signaling molecules. In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this study that dasatinib has single agent activity in relapsed and refractory CLL, particularly in lymph nodes and in high-risk del(11q) patients. Given this encouraging clinical data as well as reports of in vitro studies providing evidence for greater efficacy in combination with other agents, our future studies of dasatinib in CLL are focusing on combination therapy. This is the first completed clinical trial testing the effectiveness of dasatinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We chose to test dasatinib in CLL because pharmacodynamic evaluation of this agent has demonstrated inhibition of Lyn kinase at very low nanomolar concentrations, and Lyn kinase has been shown to be a key enzyme in CLL survival. Recent in vitro studies have confirmed that dasatinib inhibits proliferation and triggers apoptosis in CLL cells. Our trial demonstrates responses according to strict NCI-WG criteria in 3 of 15 treated patients, which indicates effectiveness in this population of patients. We also report in vitro evidence that dasatinib inhibits phosphorylation of Lyn kinase with subsequent inhibition of Syk kinase associated with apoptosis at 6 hours, suggesting the mechanism of action. \",\n"," '.

Patients over age 18 with a diagnosis of relapsed, chemotherapy-sensitive disease underwent transplantation with a matched sibling donor and conditioning with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2/d x 3) and fludarabine phosphate (25 mg/m2/d x 5). GVH prophylaxis included cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus low-dose methotrexate. Forty-four evaluable patients with a median age of 53 and median of two prior regimens were accrued. Sixteen patients had follicular NHL and 28 had histologies including 7 indolent B cell lymphomas, 4 mantle cell, 15 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 2 prolymphocytic leukemia pts. The six-month treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 2.4% and three-year TRM was 9%. Three-year event-free and overall survival were.75 and .81 for the follicular patients, .59 and .71 for the CLL/PLL patients, and .55 and .64 for the other histologies. The incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) was 29% and extensive chronic GVHD was 18%. This report demonstrates that allogeneic sibling transplantation with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen is safe and efficacious for patients with advanced indolent B cell malignancies enrolled on a Cooperative Group study. The treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) has traditionally been associated with high response rates, but a generally accepted inability to induce durable remissions and cure in the vast majority of patients with advanced disease. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) share similar characteristics as treatable but incurable malignancies with conventional approaches. Mantle cell lymphoma is a more aggressive malignancy that has recently demonstrated sensitivity and durable remissions following high dose therapy with intensive chemotherapy regimens and transplantation. These approaches have produced encouraging results in this disease and demonstrate improved progression-free and overall survival compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens plus the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab when used as a component of initial therapy. As with its use in mantle cell lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to conventional regimens for indolent lymphomas or CLL has increased the response rate and disease-free survival in these diseases. The addition of rituximab also led to an improvement in overall survival when it was included as a component of salvage therapy in one large study. ',\n"," 'Additional treatments such as 131Iodine tositumomab or 90Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan labeled anti-CD20 bound isotopes are also effective, but not necessarily more so than employing maintenance therapy with unlabelled anti-CD20 antibodies Although these improvements have been gratifying for patients afflicted with these malignancies, eventual progression to refractory disease and death remains a problem. Over the past 20 years, reports have emerged of the value of high-dose therapy with transplantation in treating these illnesses. Early studies with autologous transplants were especially encouraging when the infused marrow product was rendered tumor free by pcr analysis after ex vivo purging with anti-CD20 antibodies. Concerns remain about the risk of late complications such as the emergence of myelodysplasia or acute leukemia in patients treated with this approach and for a number of years, such treatment had fallen out of favor. Recent data has suggested that the use of antibody-mediated in vivo tumor cell purging might be lead to long remissions and possible cure without the high risk of treatment related complications associated with allogeneic transplants, but the durability of these responses and the long term risks of secondary malignancies remain uncertain. Data has emerged from both registry and large single institution studies that allogeneic donor transplants, whether with an ablative or non-ablative approach can be associated with prolonged remission and apparent cure for low-grade NHL patients. Reduced intensity regimens have demonstrated low morbidity and mortality rates associated with these approaches even after relapse following an autologous transplant. As a result of these encouraging single-institution results, CALGB undertook a prospective multi-center trial for patients with relapsed low-grade or mantle cell lymphoma, CLL, PLL, or SLL using matched related donors and a reducedintensity regimen. The current report describes the results of this Phase II study with a single conditioning regimen, GVHD prevention, and supportive care strategy. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate a six-month treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of less than 30% in a multi-center trial for patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL and PLL. The secondary objectives of the trial were to measure the response rates at six and 12 months post-transplant, the event-free and overall survival of this study population and assess the development of the total and T cell chimerism rates in the peripheral blood and marrow at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days. ',\n"," 'the cumulative risk of acute and chronic graft vs host disease, and identifying other treatment-related toxicities such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome and duration of cytopenias. Classical definitions of GVHD were used including a designation of chronic GVHD as that which occurred after day 100. All patients were < 70 years of age, had histologically documented chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or mantle cell lymphoma as follows. Diagnosis of CLL was made according to the NCI 1996 criteria. Histologic documentation of CLL or PLL required a lymphocytosis > 5,000/microl with < 55% prolymphocytes for CLL; patients with >= 55% prolymphocytes were classified as PLL. Histologic documentation of low-grade NHL was made according to the REAL Subtypes: small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular center lymphoma (grade I or II), diffuse predominantly small cell type, or marginal zone B-cell. Patients must have failed at least one prior regimen or have >=3 of the IPI risk factors; age > 60; PS>1; LDH>normal; presence of > 1 site of extra-nodal disease; or stage III/IV disease. Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma required histologic documentation with at least one of the following: immunophenotype with expression of CD5 and CD19 without CD23; cytogenetic analysis with presence of t(11;14); over-expression of cyclin D1, or bcl1 re-arrangement. All patients had stable or responsive disease to their most recent treatment and were >= 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Patients may not have received a prior autologous transplant and not have symptomatic pulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or serious infection. All patients had a matched sibling donor by low-resolution typing at HLA A, B, DR. All patients were staged with a physical exam, CT or PET/CT scan, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and organ function testing. Laboratory values included granulocytes >= 500/microL, platelets, >= 50,000/microL, calculated creatinine clearance, >= 40 cc/min, total bilirubin, <= 3 x ULN, AST, <= 3 x ULN, negative u-HCG or serum HCG if of child-bearing potential, DLCO > 40% and LVEF > 30%. Each participant signed an IRB-approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. Fludarabine was given at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day on Days -7 through -3. Cyclophosphamide was given at a dose of 1 g/m2/day IV on days -5 through -3. ',\n"," 'A target goal of 5-8 x 106 matched sibling donor peripheral blood CD34+ cells were collected following four or five days of G-CSF administration at 10 ug/kg/d on days -5 to -2 or -1, and infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus on day -1 with tapering begun on Day +90 as tolerated with a goal of stopping by Day +150. The rate of taper was adjusted for the presence of signs and symptoms of GVHD. Tacrolimus was tapered more quickly (Day +60 to Day +90) if donor chimerism of CD3 cells was < 50% at Day +60 or if disease progression occurred. A competing risks model was used to simultaneously estimate the probabilities of acute or chronic GVHD and death. A similar competing risks model was used to simultaneously estimate the probabilities of acute GVHD and death. Patients with progressive disease and no evidence of GVHD were tapered off tacrolimus at the time progressive or stable disease was noted. If there was no evidence of active GVHD, then donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given no sooner than 30 days after complete cessation of GVHD prophylaxis treatment. The initial dose of DLI was 1 x 107 CD3 cells/kg. Subsequent doses of DLI could be given at intervals of no less than 30 days in the absence of response or GVHD with doses of 5 x 107 CD3 cells/kg. Antibiotic Prophylaxis consisted of fluconazole, acyclovir, and TMP/SMX per institutional standards. CMV monitoring and therapy were based on positive cultures or pcr testing. G-CSF was administered at a dose of 5 ug/kg/day from day +5 until an ANC of >1000/ul was achieved for 3 consecutive days. Study monitoring, data quality and statistical evaluation were undertaken by the CALGB Statistical and Data Management Centers. The primary endpoint of the study was treatment-related mortality within six months of the day of stem cell infusion (Day 0). The primary hypothesis was that the probability of experiencing a TRM was less than 30%. The null hypothesis, H0, that the TRM rate, p. is less than or equal to .15 (H0: p <0.15) was compared with the alternative hypothesis, HA, that p is greater than or equal to 0.30 (HA: p> 0.30). ',\n"," 'TRM was assessed at three stages with 15 patients accrued per stage and a maximum of 45 patients entered onto the study as long as the stopping criteria for the study were not met. The significance level and power of this design were 0.08 and 0.85, respectively. The time to event distributions for overall and event-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method while the discrepancy between two time to event distributions was tested using the log-rank test. Donor chimerism in peripheral blood as well as CD19, CD3, and CD14/15 selected cells were determined using a pcr-based method that routinely achieved 1% sensitivity. CD19, CD3, and CD14/15 cells were selected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Miltenyi magnetic particles (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of each cell subset was determined by flow cytometry. Two short tandem repeat (STR) loci were amplified for each donor-recipient pair (selected from VWF, D21S11, D18S51, D16S539, PENTA D, D3S1358, FGA, D7S820, D2S1338, D10S2325, D12S391, SE33, PENTA E). Amplicons were separated using an automated nucleotide sequencer (ABI 3100 Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the quantity of each informative allele from duplicate samples was determined using GeneMapper fragment analysis software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Forty-seven patients from 13 different CALGB transplant centers were registered onto this study (Table 1). Three patients never began therapy and will not be included in this analysis of 44 patients who were treated per protocol between August, 2001 and April, 2006. Histologies included 16 follicular, 7 other indolent B cell disease, 4 mantle cell, 15 CLL and 2 PLL pts. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 2.5 years (range 0.4 to 12.4 years). The median number of prior therapies was 3 for the entire group (range 1-6) including a median of 3 for those patients with CLL/PLL or Mantle Cell/Other histologies and 2 prior therapies for the 16 patients with follicular NHL. Four patients had received prior irradiation and 1 of 27 NHL patients had an ECOG performance status greater than 1. Forty-one percent of NHL patients had > 1 site of extra-nodal disease. The majority of patients had either a short duration of initial remission, young age, high-risk disease, or were transplanted following multiple therapies. Overall 6-month treatment-related mortality was 2.3% (1 subject) at day 117 from GVHD and sepsis indicating strong statistical evidence in support of the study hypothesis (Table 2). ',\n"," 'Three additional patients died of non-relapse causes at 18, 19, and 36 months from GVHD and sepsis for a three-year treatment-related mortality rate of 9%. One additional patient died of fungal pneumonia in conjunction with treatment for chronic GVHD 7 years following transplant, while another died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma for an overall non-relapse mortality of 13.6% after a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Twenty-five percent (11/44) of patients experienced grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities, primarily from infection or GVHD. Additional serious toxicities included one pulmonary embolus, one grade 4 sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, and two second malignancies; one of the pancreas and a second of the distal esophagus. The median duration of an ANC < 1000/ul was 8 days (range 0-19) and thrombocytopenia < 100,000/ul was 12 days (range 0-38). Twenty-seven of the 44 patients required no platelet transfusions. The median number of red cell transfusions during the transplant period was 1 (range 0-9) with 13 patients requiring no RBC transfusions. Infectious complications were documented in 67% of patients; viral infections in 32%, including CMV reactivation in 15% of patients and CMV infection in 2 patients, bacterial in 41% and fungal in 20% of patients (more than one type of infection was seen in multiple patients). An additional 30% of patients had site-specific infections for which no organism was identified. As described in Table 3, the median % of peripheral blood donor T-cell chimerism at days 30, 60 and 180 were 88, 94, and 97% respectively. Comparable values for unfractionated (lymphoid + myeloid population) peripheral blood chimerism at days 30, 60, and 180 were 80, 85, and 99% respectively. While these median values were high, a significant percentage of patients demonstrated a persistent mixed chimerism picture out to day 180. Greater than 90% peripheral blood donor T cells was seen in 45, 61, and 64% of patients at days 30, 60, and 180 post-transplant. Likewise, > 90% unfractionated peripheral blood donor chimerism was seen in 26, 36, and 65% of patients at days 30, 60, and 180 respectively. (Table 3) Thus, if full donor chimerism was defined as > 90% donor cells, then 64 and 65% of patients showed full donor engraftment in the unfractionated and lymphoid compartments respectively by six months. Bone marrow and peripheral blood gave similar chimerism results at each time point. Finally, no correlation was observed between chimerism status and relapse. ',\n"," 'The overall incidence of grades 1-4 acute GVHD was 61% of which 11% was grade 2, 16% grade 3, and 2.3% grade 4. Twenty-nine point three (29.3) percent of patients experienced limited and 18% had extensive chronic GVHD. Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as time to progression or death due to any cause (Table 4). There have been 18 events. Twelve patients have relapsed at 3 (3 pts), 4 (1 pt), 6 (2 pts), 9(1 pt) 15 (2 pts), 20 (1 pt), 29 (1pt) and 45 (1 pt) months post transplant. The other 6 events were deaths in the absence of relapse due to GVHD (2), sepsis (2), fungal pneumonia in the setting of chronic GVHD (1) and adenocarcinoma (1). While most patients with lymphoma achieved optimal response within the first three months post-transplant, the CLL/PLL cohort demonstrated a slower pace of response with the median time to CR being 3.5 months, but one patient reported as requirig 9 months and another 22 months post-transplant. Six of 17 patients with CLL/PLL, 3/16 with follicular and 3/11 patients with other indolent B cell malignancies have relapsed. Four patients received DLI for progressive disease and subsequently died of their malignancy. The other relapsed patients were felt to be ineligible for DLI either because of uncontrollable relapse or pre-existing GVHD. One additional patient received DLI for a stable partial response and one for loss of chimerism. Both remain in complete remission more than four years post transplant. For the 30 patients still alive, the median follow-up is 4.6 years. The EFS at 3 years for follicular patients was 0.75 (.46-.90), compared to 0.59 (.33-.78) for CLL/PLL and 0.55 (0.23-.78) for the other and mantle cell histologies combined (Figure 1). Fourteen deaths have occurred from progressive disease (7), infection and GVH (6, one of which occurred following a second transplant for relapsed disease), and a second malignancy (1). Overall survival at 3 years is 0.81 (.51-.93) for the follicular histologies, 0.71 (.43-.87) for CLL/PLL and 0.64 (.30-.85) for the other and mantle cell histologies, respectively (Figure 2). Despite the recent advances in standard therapies, treatment outcomes for patients with indolent B cell malignancies remain suboptimal, as life expectancies are clearly reduced by these diagnoses. ',\n"," 'For those patients who are seeking a cure, stem cell transplantation has been available for many years, although late recurrences and the development of secondary myelodysplasia have undermined the utility of autologous transplants while treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and lack of suitable donors have limited the use of allogeneic transplants. Recently, the use of reduced intensity regimens has markedly reduced early morbidity and mortality following allogeneic transplantation. While early relapse and later complications of chronic graft vs host disease and infection remain a problem, the overall success with these reduced intensity regimens have all indicated a plateau on the survival curves with 4 year or longer disease free remission rates exceeding 60% for chemotherapy-responsive patients. The data from Khouri is especially encouraging with the use of transplant and high-dose rituximab as the progression-free survival (PFS) in that trial exceeded 80% at five years with a very low incidence of acute and chronic GVHD for matched related transplant patients. A treatment regimen including the identical schedule and dosage of rituximab is currently being evaluated in a multi-center trial sponsored by an intergroup collaboration between the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT-CTN), CALGB, ECOG, and SWOG. In the current report, the fact that a multi-center group was able to conduct an allogeneic transplant study that yielded excellent outcomes with only a 2.3% six month TRM was very encouraging. Recent mortality rates from other trials are similar, but at the time the study was planned, there was no Cooperative Group experience with reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant on which to base an expectation of TRM. Morbidity was also low, with an overall incidence of grade IV non-hematologic toxicities of 25% including an 11% incidence of pulmonary complications that consisted of pneumonitis, infection, and alveolar hemorrhage. Severe hepatic and renal toxicities were rare and the overall incidence of infections included 5% CMV infection and 15% reactivation, 41% bacterial, and 20% documented fungal processes. The overall incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD was 29%. Thirty percent of patients had limited and 18% had extensive chronic GVHD. While these numbers are somewhat higher than those reported by groups that have used alemtuzamab as a component of the conditioning regimen, reactivation of CMV is less frequent, and the need for donor lymphocyte infusion for relapse appears lower in the current study. ',\n"," 'At day 30 post-transplant, only 26% of patients demonstrated > 90% unfractionated peripheral blood donor chimerism and 45% demonstrated > 90% T cell donor chimerism. By day 180, the % of patients with > 90% unfractionated and T cell donor chimerism had increased to 65 and 64% respectively. At the same time points, the median percentage of donor T cell chimerism was higher and reached 85 and 94% by day 60, and 99 and 97% by day 180. Thus, while the median % of donor cells is high in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments by day 180, only about 2/3 of patients achieved full donor chimerism in both components of the peripheral blood by as late as 6 months following transplant. If the approach encouraged by Thomsen and colleagueswas followed, this could lead to donor lymphocyte infusions for as many as 1/3 of the patients, even in the absence of disease progression. Peripheral blood and marrow values correlated well with one another. The lack of correlation between relapse and chimerism status may reflect small numbers of patients in our study or alternatively, indicate that partial chimerism may in fact be sufficient to maintain an anti-tumor effect while associated with a low rate of long term GVHD in most patients. Our results are somewhat different from the report by Thomson where relapse was lower in those patients who converted from partial to full donor chimerism after DLI infusions compared to those who remained with a mixed chimerism status despite DLI. They also reported a higher remission and durable remission rate in those relapsed patients who received DLI than we observed, perhaps due to earlier intervention at a time of less advanced disease. Alterations in the immunosuppression regimens used or early infusion of DLI might enhance the rate and frequency of full donor chimerism, but one would expect this to be associated with an increased rate and severity of GVHD. Despite these concerns, the Thomson results were excellent, with 76% of patients remaining progression-free at four years with only 18% having extensive chronic GVHD. There were 14 deaths reported to date in the CALGB study including nine in patients who had relapsed and required additional therapy. One patient died from a pancreatic cancer, 2 years post transplant. Five patients died of infection related to GVHD at 4, 18, 19, 36, and 72 months post transplant. ',\n"," 'Significant challenges remain to the successful application of this approach. While the use of well-matched unrelated donors has not had a negative impact in recent reports of transplant studies for acute leukemia, data on approaches using such donors in low-grade malignancies is just emerging. Recent reports by the EBMT and CIBMTR have indicated that while use of unrelated donors resulted in a somewhat higher incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, the overall rates of progression, morbidity, and mortality compare favorably to outcomes following fully-ablative transplants. It is notable, however, that the recent paper by Thomson reported higher rates of progression-free survival in their matched related than unrelated patients, even with a reduced intensity regimen. While 53 is relatively old for allogeneic transplants, it is young for low grade NHL and CLL populations and in future trials, one would anticipate an even higher median age and likely a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Whether the relapse rate could be reduced further by more intensive therapy remains a question to be considered given the high rate of toxicity and low success rate associated with frank relapse followed by DLI in the current study. Of the six patients who received DLI, four died from progressive disease despite the onset of significant GVHD while the two patients infused with DLI for loss of chimerism and stable partial remission remain in CR more than two years beyond DLI infusion. This suggests that careful monitoring for relapse and early use of DLI may be a more effective strategy than delaying such efforts until frank recurrence is observed. Although the number of enrolled patients with low-grade NHL or CLL are less than in the Khouri or Thomson trials, our results are remarkably similar, especially for the follicular lymphoma patients. Even in more aggressive diseases such as prolymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma, there appears to be a plateau on the event-free survival curves, albeit with median follow-up that remains less than four years. While the number of patients is small, we have only had one patient relapse beyond 2 years in this study, suggesting that most responses will be durable. This is consistent with the results published by the M.D. ',\n"," 'Anderson group in which non-ablative allogeneic transplant appeared to confer a higher likelihood of prolonged disease-free survival in mantle cell patients, especially in those with relapsed or refractory disease, compared to what had been achieved with autologous transplantation. Also of note is the prolonged time to best response that can be seen in these patients, particularly those with CLL. This likely reflects in part the slow time to establishing full donor chimerism which is associated with the graft vs leukemia effect that is known to occur in these patients but which can take months to develop. Our results testify not only to the efficacy of this approach, but confirm that this treatment can be undertaken safely and effectively in a large number of transplant-centers by following rigorous protocols.

',\n"," 'Acadesine has shown in vitro to selectively induce apoptosis in B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. We conducted a phase I/II open-label clinical study, to determine the safety and tolerability of acadesine given intravenously as a 4-h infusion to CLL patients. Patient population included CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease who had received one or more prior lines of treatment including either a fludarabine or an alkylator-based regimen. Twenty-four patients were included: eighteen in Part I treated at single doses of 50-315 mg/kg, and six in Part II, three with two doses at 210 mg/kg and three with five doses at 210 mg/kg. A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg; 210 mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal biological dose (OBD). Grade >=2 hyperuricemia occurred commonly but was not clinically significant and resolved with the administration of prophylactic allopurinol. Other adverse events included transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia (not clinically significant), renal impairment, and transient infusion-related hypotension (clinically significant). Trends of efficacy such as a reduction of peripheral CLL cells and reduction in lymphadenopathy were observed; however, the results were variable due to the small population and the range of doses tested. A MTD of 210 mg/kg was established with single acadesine dose. Multiple dose administrations at the OBD were tested with an acceptable safety profile, showing that acadesine might be a valuable agent for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent type of leukemia in the Western world, affecting mainly the elderly. CLL follows an extremely variable clinical course, with overall survival times ranging from months to decades. The symptoms and signs of the disease arise from a clonal excess of B cells caused mainly by defects that prevent programmed cell death (apoptosis). Available treatments for CLL generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse and CLL remains an incurable disease. Fludarabine-based regimens have significantly improved the efficacy of CLL treatment, and recently, a large randomized trial showed that the addition of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in treatment-naive patients (as first-line therapy) and PFS in relapsed patients. However, current chemotherapy is not selective for CLL cells, and attendant T-cell apoptosis leads to adverse reactions, including severe and prolonged immunosuppression. ',\n"," \"Conventional treatment of CLL is also associated with temporary myelosuppression with a concomitant increased risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding/bruising. Almost all patients relapse or become resistant to existing therapies, especially those with genomic alterations such as deletion 17p and/or mutations in TP53. Both have been shown to predict for poor response to chemotherapy and to be associated with poor OS. Acadesine (Acadra ), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-d-ribofuranoside or AICA-riboside, is a water soluble nucleoside with a different mechanism of action compared to currently approved nucleoside analogs (e.g., fludarabine). When added to cell cultures or administered to animals or humans, acadesine is phosphorylated to its ribotide, AICA-ribotide (ZMP). ZMP is a natural endogenous intermediate in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Acadesine induces apoptosis of CLL cells cultured ex vivo in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range 50 muM to 1 mM, and with an IC50 of 380 +- 60 muM. Incorporation of acadesine into the cell and its subsequent phosphorylation to ZMP are necessary to induce apoptosis. Moreover, acadesine is not reliant on the p53 tumor suppressor or ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) proteins to drive apoptosis, and hence, the absence/loss of function of these proteins in patients with CLL should not affect the activity of acadesine. This is an important issue because alterations of either p53 or ATM are related to resistance to chemotherapy in CLL. Also, no significant differences in acadesine-induced apoptosis have been observed in ex vivo analysis between unmutated and mutated CLL samples and either between ZAP70 positive and ZAP70 negative cases. Ex vivo, B cells were found to be much more sensitive to acadesine-induced apoptosis than T cells. Given that fludarabine causes both B- and T-cell apoptosis, the latter leading to the common and severe complication of immunosuppression, the B cell targeted mode of action of acadesine could provide a safety benefit over other commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens and a valuable treatment alternative to certain groups of patients with CLL who are refractory to other treatments. This phase I/II study was approved by the competent institutional review board and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00559624). A total of 24 patients were enrolled in the study. All of them provided written informed consent, prior to any study related procedure not part of the patient's normal medical care. \",\n"," \"part of the patient's normal medical care. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of CLL according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group Criteria, with refractory or relapsed disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status <=2, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. They had received one or more prior lines of treatment which must have included either a fludarabine- or cladribine-based regimen or an alkylator-based regimen. Refractoriness was defined as any patient who had failed to achieve a complete response (CR), nodular partial response (nPR), or partial response (PR) according to the NCI Working Group Guidelines for CLL. Fludarabine refractoriness also included patients who achieved a CR, nPR, or PR of <=6 months duration. Other inclusion criteria were adequate renal function, defined by serum creatinine <=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and a calculated creatinine clearance of >=60 mL/min. This was a Phase I/II, open-label, study to evaluate an escalating dose and number of doses of acadesine in patients with CLL. The primary endpoint of the study was to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of acadesine in CLL patients, and the secondary endpoints were to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of acadesine and its metabolite, ZMP, and to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) of acadesine in patients with CLL. OBD for single-dose administration of acadesine was considered as the dose enabling a plasma concentration in the range of that causing apoptosis in in vitro models determined from the PK and safety data, and was defined as the dose below that at which dose escalation is stopped in Part I of the study and this dose will be the starting dose used in Part II of the study which will assess repeat dosing with acadesine. Patients were enrolled in the study in cohorts of three patients or more, depending upon the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Day 1 dosing was staggered between all patients in each cohort by a minimum of 48 h. In Part I, patients received a single dose of acadesine on Day 1. In Part II, patients received up to 5 doses of acadesine over a period of up to 15 days starting on Day 1. The starting dose for Part I was 50 mg/kg given as a 4 h (+-30 min) intravenous (iv) infusion on Day 1 only. \",\n"," 'Patients were assessed for safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) for up to 3 weeks after dosing (to Day 22). Investigators were advised to treat patients with prophylactic allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia in all patients in Part I from Cohort 2 onward; additionally, a specific dose and duration of treatment of allopurinol was specified for Part II. The decision to escalate to the next dose in a separate cohort of patients was based on the assessment of safety, including any DLTs, PK modeling of exposure to ZMP, and PD response data, where available, by the independent Data Monitoring Board (DMB). Dose escalation in Part I of the study followed a modified Fibonacci dose escalation design, with 100 % dose escalations allowed until a confirmed grade 2 toxicity (as defined by NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 for all toxicities except anemia and thrombocytopenia where CTCAE version 2.0 adapted for leukemia studies was used) considered related to treatment occurred. Once this occurred, future dose escalations were incremental (67, 50, 40, 33 %, etc.). In Part II, patients were treated with 2 or 5 consecutive doses at the MTD/OBD identified in Part I of the study. Incidence, causality, and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), local tolerability, changes in laboratory values (including liver enzymes, blood glucose and uric acid) and vital signs were assessed. They were assessed for their relationship to acadesine and classified for severity according to the CTCAE v3.0 for all events except anemia and thrombocytopenia which were assessed according to CTCAE v2.0 (which uses % changes relative to study baseline/entry). In Part I of the study, blood samples for PK analysis (for both acadesine and its metabolite ZMP) were taken pre-dose and 0, 30, 60 min, 2, 6, 20, 72, 96, and 168 h, 14 and 21 days post-dose in all cohorts. In Part II, PK samples were also taken at pre-dose and 0 min and 20 h post-dose for any interim doses, and 72, 96, and 168 h and 14 and 21 days after completion of the last dose for each patient. Acadesine and ZMP concentrations were determined by a validated bioanalytical HPLC-MS/MS method, with lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) set at 20 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL for acadesine in human plasma and ZMP in whole blood, respectively. ',\n"," 'A noncompartmental PK analysis of the acadesine and ZMP concentrations was undertaken using the WinNonlin software, Professional Version 5.3 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Although no International Working Group (IWG) disease response assessments were included in the protocol, bi-dimensional nodal area (sum of right neck, left neck, right axillary, left axillary, right inguinal and left inguinal nodes) and uni-dimensional lymph nodes (liver and spleen length) were measured. The PD effect of acadesine in patients with CLL was assessed by B-cell and T-cell counts in peripheral blood. Samples were taken at pre-dose and 20, 72, 168 h, and 21 days post-dose in all cohorts. In Part II, PD samples were also taken at pre-dose and 20 h post-dose for any interim doses, and 72, 168 h and 21 days after completion of the last dose for each patient. From January 2008 to January 2011, 24 CLL patients with refractory or relapsed disease were enrolled onto this phase I/II clinical trial. The pretreatment characteristics are listed in Table 1. Patients were between 56 and 79 years old, all diagnosed with CLL between 4 and 21 years (inclusive) prior to study entry. The majority were males (15 patients, 63 %) and had received between 1 and 13 previous lines of therapy (mean 2.7). All patients had an ECOG score of <=2 and had received either a fludarabine- or cladribine-based regimen or an alkylator-based regimen, in accordance with the eligibility criteria. Individual Rai and Binet staging and relapsed/refractory status at screening are displayed in Table 2. In Part I of the study, patients received a single dose of acadesine on Day 1 at escalating doses: 50 mg/kg (6 patients), 83.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 139.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 210 mg/kg (3 patients), and 315 mg/kg (3 patients). At the 315 mg/kg dose level, 2 of the 3 patients experienced a DLT. Also, PK data indicate that at 315 mg/kg, a plateau in acadesine conversion to ZMP was reached. Therefore, 210 mg/kg was designated per protocol MTD and OBD for single acadesine administration based on the decision of the DMB. The dose administered in Part II (210 mg/kg) was based on the results of Part I. ',\n"," 'In view of the possible risk of acadesine-related renal adverse events or laboratory evidence of creatinine elevation, either as part of a clinical tumor lysis syndrome or occurring as isolated renal impairment, acadesine in Part II Cohort 1 was to be administered with a minimum of a 72-h interval between each dose. Thus, 3 patients received 2 doses (on Days 1 and 4) and 3 patients received 5 consecutive doses (on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, and 15). Acadesine infusions were well tolerated. No acadesine-related deaths occurred in the study, and no patients withdrew from the study due to AEs (all causality, either related or not related to the study drug), in either the single or repeated dose part of the study. In Part I, a total of 78 AEs were reported in 15 (83 %) patients, and approximately half of all AEs were reported as drug-related (42 AEs, 54 %. See Table 3). Six SAEs were reported in 2 patients in the 50 mg/kg (3 SAEs) and in 2 patients in the 315 mg/kg (3 SAEs) cohorts. In Part II, a total of 48 AEs were reported in 6 patients, over half of all AEs were reported as drug-related (31 AEs, 65 %. See Table 3), and there were no SAEs. Among all study patients, a single CTCAE grade 4 AE was reported (hyperuricemia) and 9 CTCAE grade 3 events (in 6 patients) were reported. In part I of the study, one patient at 50 mg/kg experienced hyperuricemia (CTCAE grade 4, DLT but not reported as an SAE). As a result, prophylactic allopurinol was administered to patients in the higher dose cohorts, and no further hyperuricemia AEs occurred. Two patients, one at 210 mg/kg and one at 315 mg/kg, reported acadesine-related transient hypotension, CTCAE grade 1 and 2, respectively, starting after acadesine infusion and resolved the day after acadesine dosing (Day 2) with no clinical sequelae. Only the patient treated with 315 mg/kg required treatment (a sodium chloride iv infusion) and had concomitant AEs of presyncope (vasovagal syndrome) and nausea, both CTCAE grade 1. In Part I, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs in Part I were anemia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2, reported in 3 patients, all of them with hemoglobin values below the normal range at pre-dose) and diarrhea, reported in 2 patients, of CTCAE grade 1 (see Table 3). ',\n"," 'At 315 mg/kg, 2 out of 3 patients experienced DLTs: the first patient experienced a tumor lysis syndrome (classed as a SAE, CTCAE grade 3), which resolved within 13 days with rasburicase treatment. The second patient, diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma and a large abdominal lymphomatous mass, reported renal impairment/increased creatinine (both reported as SAEs and CTCAE grade 3), which resolved quickly (returning to grade 1 within 14 days) with conservative treatment (no dialysis required). In the repeat dose phase, no SAEs were observed. There was evidence of transient increases in creatinine after dosing in the 5 x 210 mg/kg repeat dose cohort: one DLT was reported in one patient (increased creatinine; CTCAE grade 2) and an AE was reported in another patient (increased creatinine; CTCAE grade 1), both patients having normal creatinine levels at baseline. One patient treated with 2 doses at 210 mg/kg reported acadesine-related hypotension (CTCAE grade 2), which resolved spontaneously within 24 h, without treatment and without clinical sequelae. In Part II, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs during repeat dosing were anemia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2; reported in 5 patients, 4 of them with hemoglobin values below the normal range at pre-dose), thrombocytopenia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2, reported by 2 patients, one of them with platelets pre-dose levels below the normal range), and nausea (reported by 3 patients; CTCAE grade 1 or 2). There was reduction in the size of palpable lymph nodes after single and repeat dosing with acadesine, although it should be noted that formal IWG response criteria assessments were not planned in this phase I/II study. In Part I, 11/18 patients showed evidence of anti-leukemic activity, in terms of decreases in B cells and/or decreases in the size of lymph nodes (decreases >20 % at any time after dosing with respect to pre-dosing values in either B-cell counts or lymph nodes size. See Table 4). In Part II, 5/6 patients showed evidence of anti-leukemic activity according to the same criteria. For example, a patient with Del13q14 and Del17p, treated at 50 mg/kg, experienced a sustained reduction in B-cell counts, which at Day 22 post-treatment was 58 % lower than at baseline. Also, one patient treated with five doses at 210 mg/kg experienced a reduction in B-cell counts up to 65.7 % on Day 8 post-baseline. This patient had lymph nodes involvement and paraneoplastic skin manifestations. ',\n"," 'The lymphocyte count has continued to drop, and 18 months after acadesine treatment, lymphocyte count is below 5,000/muL, and there are no signs of disease in lymph nodes or skin. Although we only had data from 3 patients per cohort (6 in cohort 1), we compared the B- and T-cell mean values at every post-treatment time with values at pre-treatment. Changes in T-cell counts were inconsistent across the cohorts and no overall significant trend was apparent. For B cells, statistically significant decreases occurred at some time points in some cohorts (see Table 4). In cohort 1, decrease in B cells at Day 2 was statistically significant using parametric (p = 0.012, Student t test) or nonparametric (p = 0.043, Wilcoxon signed rank test) method. Similarly, when pre-dose B cells were compared to Day 2 results in all 15 patients from the single-dose cohort where both values are available, a significant difference was found by both statistical methods (p = 0.038 and p = 0.027, respectively). This suggests a trend in decrease in B cells and tends to confirm the results from in vitro experiments, where acadesine induced apoptosis selectively in B cells. Results showed that acadesine and ZMP were rapidly distributed in the bloodstream, and acadesine was rapidly converted into ZMP. Maximum acadesine concentrations were observed at the end of the infusions and from then on concentrations started to decrease. The LLOQ for acadesine was reached between 20 h and 15 days. Maximum concentrations of ZMP were found between the end of the infusion and 30 min-1 h later due to the time elapsed between acadesine administration and its transformation into ZMP. Blood ZMP concentrations started decreasing progressively from 1 h on (after the end of the infusion), reaching the LLOQ between 5 and 22 days after administration (Fig. 1). At the OBD (210 mg/kg single dose), maximum concentration (Cmax) for acadesine was 38,736 ng/mL and 270,988 ng/mL for ZMP (median of the 3 patients treated in the cohort). The Area under the curve (AUC0 24) was 123,124 ng h/mL for acadesine and 2,066,170 ng h/mL for ZMP (median of 3 patients treated in the cohort). ',\n"," 'Considering that the sum of the Cmax molar plasma concentrations of acadesine and ZMP, obtained at the end of the 4-h infusion, would be equivalent to the dose used in an in vitro cell culture, at the OBD dose (210 mg/kg single dose) target acadesine concentrations were achieved (median acadesine + ZMP concentration was 0.9 mM, higher than the 0.5 mM concentrations used to induce apoptosis in in vitro cell cultures)). Time of maximum drug concentration (Tmax), maximum drug concentration (Cmax), area under the time-concentration curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0 24), and half life (t1/2) for all cohorts are summarized in Table 5. The PK analysis of both acadesine and ZMP demonstrates a high degree of inter-subject variability. For both cohorts in Part II, there was no important accumulation of acadesine or ZMP upon multiple dosing. Following single-dose infusion of acadesine, there was a trend toward a plateau in ZMP levels after increasing the acadesine dose from 139.5 to 210 mg/kg. PK data at 315 mg/kg and PK modeling indicate a plateau in acadesine conversion to ZMP. Thus, the OBD determined from the PK and safety data was 210 mg/kg. This study was the first administration of acadesine in cancer patients:specifically CLL. A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine in patients with CLL at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg. The key safety findings with regard to AEs and clinical laboratory results were asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient renal impairment/increased creatinine, and infusion-related hypotension. Hyperuricemia has been documented in previous studies with acadesine administered to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury, and given that acadesine is metabolized to uric acid, hyperuricemia was not unexpected in patients with CLL. Prophylactic allopurinol adopted from cohort 2 (Part I) resulted in no further hyperuricemia occurring in the study. Four patients had renal impairment during the study (two received 315 mg/kg and two 5 x 210 mg/kg). All of them recovered with appropriate management and none of them required dialysis. Two independent nephrologists reviewed data from all patients and conclude that the renal dysfunction associated with acadesine treatment exhibited functional characteristics rather than nephrotoxic features, based on the rapid reversibility and full recovery of the renal dysfunction even after several acadesine consecutive doses. They proposed renal function monitoring and prophylaxis measures that will be implemented in the following clinical trials with acadesine. ',\n"," 'Modest (grade 1 or 2), transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, with recovery to baseline levels occurring in most patients within last days of acadesine administration, were reported in 3/18 and 5/6 patients treated in Part I and Part II of the study, respectively. All but one these AEs were drug-related, and none of them were clinically significant. Acadesine-related transient hypotension occurred in 3 patients in this trial. The hypotension typically occurred after acadesine infusion and lasted several hours with no clinically significant sequellae. Recovery occurred either spontaneously or with conservative (iv fluid administration) management. Of note, there was no evidence of renal toxicity or hypotension in pre-clinical studies or in cardiac studies in more than 2,000 patients who were administered acadesine. This is the first time that the PK of acadesine has been investigated in patients with CLL. The results indicate a high degree of inter-subject variability. Several possible factors may be contributing to this observation, for example: the underlying disease, associated co-morbidities, and co-medication. The OBD, that is, the dose enabling a plasma concentration in the range of that causing apoptosis in in vitro models determined from the PK and safety data, was 210 mg/kg. In terms of disease activity, there were no conventional IWG responses in this study; such assessments were not prospectively planned as is typical in a phase I trial. However, there was evidence of anti-leukemic activity in 16/24 patients based on a more than 20 % reduction in either B-cell count or size of palpable lymph nodes. In vitro anti-leukemic activity independent of genetic alterations has been previously described with acadesine by Pairet and collaborators. Our study size is too small to draw definitive conclusions, but indications of anti-leukemic activity were seen in patients with poor prognosis genetic alterations, suggesting that acadesine might be a potential treatment option in this sub-group. The absence of significant reduction in T-cell counts with acadesine in this study is in agreement with ex vivo data which showed B cells were more sensitive to acadesine-induced apoptosis than T cells. This is in contrast with current chemotherapy agents, such as fludarabine, which cause long-lasting T- and NK-cell depression. Although early indications from this study are that acadesine does not induce T-cell apoptosis to the same extent as existing treatments, larger scale studies will be required to confirm this in the wider population. ',\n"," 'In conclusion, this study has defined the DLT, MTD, and OBD of acadesine and also shows provisional evidence of acadesine anti-leukemic activity, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. Assessment and monitoring of renal function is essential in patients receiving acadesine. The modest myelosuppressive profile observed with acadesine (if confirmed in larger trials) may make it either an attractive combination partner for standard of care agents used in CLL patients or a candidate for post-induction intervention. The p53-independent mechanism of action of acadesine makes it an attractive compound in patients bearing alterations of this pathway, which represent a significant group in advanced patients, and for whom few therapeutic options are available. Preliminary data also show that acadesine has in vitro toxicity toward other B-cell malignancies, such as mantle cell lymphoma (especially when combined with monoclonal antibodies) and multiple myeloma.

But unlike myeloid leukemia, B cell leukemia and lymphoma are less sensitive to allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy. Moreover, the beneficial graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect may be associated with moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches augmenting the anti-tumor efficacy of DLI and dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD are needed. The anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) FBTA05 may improve the targeting of tumor cells by redirecting immune allogeneic effector cells while reducing the risk of undesirable reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD. Based on this underlying treatment concept and on promising data taken from preclinical results and a small pilot study, an open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II-study is conducted to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the investigational antibody FBTA05 in combination with DLI for patients suffering from rituximab- and/or alemtuzumab-refractory, CD20-positive low- or high-grade lymphoma after allogeneic SCT. During the first trial phase with emphasis on dose escalation a maximum of 24 patients distributed into 4 cohorts will be enrolled. For the evaluation of preliminary efficacy data a maximum of 12 patients (6 patients with low-grade lymphoma and/or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / 6 patients with high-grade or aggressive lymphoma) will attend the second phase of this clinical trial. Promising data (e.g. induction of cellular immunity; GVL predominance over GVHD; achievement of partial or complete responses; prolongation of time-to-progression) obtained from this phase I/II trial would represent the first milestone in the clinical evaluation of a novel immunotherapeutic concept for treatment-resistant low- and high-grade lymphoma and NHL patients in relapse. NCT01138579 Approximately half of the patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and the majority of patients with low-grade lymphomas cannot be cured by conventional therapeutic treatment regimes. Intensive chemotherapy followed by stem cell support has improved survival of patients with chemotherapy sensitive lymphoma. The majority of these patients, however, will still relapse, even after high-dose therapy and subsequently have limited therapeutic options. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can induce long-term remission due to a graft versus lymphoma (GVL) reaction, this occurs predominantly in a highly selected population of indolent lymphoma patients. \",\n"," 'A GVL reaction is less pronounced in patients with aggressive lymphoma, resulting in a high relapse rate. In patients not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, palliative treatment is restricted by resistance to chemotherapy and complications of infection. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies with improved anti-tumor efficacy need to be developed for such patients. Immunotherapies with monoclonal antibodies (mABs) directed against the CD20 antigen have previously been shown to be highly effective. Rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and Biogen IDEC Inc, Cambridge, MA), an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) 1 chimeric mAb, induced overall response rates (ORR) up to 50% in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade B cell lymphoma. In first line-treatment, rituximab induces response rates up to 75% in patients with follicular or low-grade NHL. But despite these encouraging results, there are still numerous patients who do not respond or finally relapse. Efforts to further increase the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies resulted in the development of trAb FBTA05 which mediates effective tumor cell cytotoxicity even at low CD20 expression levels, and probably even more importantly, induces a lasting anti-tumor immunity. FBTA05 is a heterologous antibody, composed of two potent heavy chain subclasses, a mouse IgG2a and a rat IgG2b chain, each with their respective light chains. It therefore possesses two specific and one functional binding site. FBTA05 binds with one binding arm to the CD3 antigen on T cells and with the second binding arm to the CD20 antigen, which is expressed exclusively on normal and malignant B cells, but not on hematological precursor cells or other human cell types. In addition, the third functional site within the hybrid Fc region binds to Fcgamma receptor type I, IIa and III which are expressed by accessory cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells) of the immune system. In this \"tri-cell complex\", an important \"crosstalk\" between T cells and accessory cells can occur, which includes co-stimulatory signals necessary for a physiological T cell activation cascade. The simultaneous activation of different immune cells at the tumor site results in efficient killing of tumor cells by several complementary mechanisms (e.g. release of cytokines, perforin-mediated lysis and phagocytosis). The antibody-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells by accessory cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) is believed to result in the processing of tumor antigens and presentation on the surface of these cells. ',\n"," 'result in polyclonal humoral and cellular immune responses, a T cell response even against unknown, tumor-associated peptides may be induced. The combined attack of various immune cells with different killing mechanisms induced by FBTA05 leads to a significant tumor cell elimination when compared to monospecific antibodies or conventional bispecific antibodies. In addition, the induction of a variety of effector mechanisms may result in a protective long-term anti-tumor immunity. The postulated mechanism of action of the trAb FBTA05 is shown in Figure 1. Prior to the start of the current phase I/II dose escalating study, FBTA05 was administered in a compassionate use setting to patients with recurrent and refractory B cell malignancies following allo-SCT, and within a phase I/II trial (IV-A05-LL-01, EudraCT No: 2006-006694-24) to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL in an autologous setting. In compassionate use a limited number of advanced cancer patients were treated with FBTA05. These, included 4 patients with refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), 4 patients with refractory high-grade non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (HG-NHL) and 1 patient with refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). The treatment comprised escalating doses of FBTA05 with a range of 10-2,000 mug per single infusion. The maximum cumulative dosage administered per patient ranged between 130-13,610 mug of FBTA05. The duration of treatment was between 5-76 days. Following FBTA05 treatment, patients received DLI. Due to the nature of the different indications, the number of peripheral B cells prior to the start of FBTA05 infusions showed a large variation. An anti-tumor response (decrease of leukemic cells and shrinking of lymph nodes) was observed in 3 of 4 CLL patients. In 1 case of HG-NHL, a halt of progression for almost 4 months was observed. The effect of FBTA05 in the other patients was not evaluable due to other concomitant treatment or disease (fungal infection). Relapse finally occurred in all patients. The main side effects were restricted to fever, chills, bone pain and transient increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGT). Only one case of GVHD (grade 3) was observed after FBTA05 and DLI and this was in the ALL patient. In context of the administration of the highest cumulative dose of FBTA05 (6,240 mug), a transient granulocytopenia was detected in a HG-NHL patient. The cytokine profile was characterized by a transient increase of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs) were not detectable. ',\n"," 'According to the current experience with the anti HER2/neu directed trAb ertumaxomab there is a correlation between the formation of HAMA and human anti-rat antibodies (HARAs), so HARA development in these patients would seem to be unlikely. Due to the changes in the development program of the sponsor (Fresenius Biotech GmbH) the phase I/II dose escalating study (IV-A05-LL-01, EudraCT No: 2006-006694-24) was prematurely terminated after treatment of 3 patients in the first cohort (maximum dose 100 mug FBTA05). Thus, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) could be established and only limited data on drug safety are available. In general, the intravenous infusion of FBTA05 was assessed to be safe and well tolerated, even at higher antibody doses. However, due to the limited number of patients treated, to variable disease progression in individual patients and to a variety of different concomitant treatments used, this information needs to be interpreted with caution. Antibody based therapies (rituximab, alemtuzumab), especially in combination with chemotherapeutic regimes, offer some advantages in patients with CLL and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Nevertheless, most patients finally relapse. Especially patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have a very poor prognosis in case of early relapse after chemotherapy combined with rituximab. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further develop alternative treatment options whereby the CD20 antigen represents a solid target for innovative therapeutic approaches: (i) it is expressed on most B-cell lymphomas, (ii) it is only expressed on B cells, but not precursor cells or human tissues and (iii) it is not shed or secreted upon antibody binding. The trAb FBTA05 provides a novel and unique approach for the targeted treatment of CD20 expressing neoplasias. The potency of FBTA05 has been demonstrated by efficient in vitro killing of human B cell tumor cells, as well as cells derived from CLL patients expressing only low levels of CD20. FBTA05 in combination with DLI has already been administered to patients in compassionate use prior to the start of the scheduled phase I/II study and assessed to be feasible, safe and well tolerated even at high antibody and T cell doses. Most importantly, some anti-tumor responses were observed in 3 CLL and 1 NHL patient. It is well established that DLI, given as a single treatment is effective in hematological relapse post-SCT, but it is suggested that concerted treatment with additional drugs may further improve treatment outcome. ',\n"," 'Thus, the combination of DLI and the anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trAb FBTA05 might be a promising treatment option for patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allo-SCT. Since both, the desired GVL and the unwanted detrimental GVHD responses are mediated by T lymphocytes present in DLI preparations, FBTA05 has the capacity to enhance these GVL effects as autologous and allogeneic T cells are targeted to tumor sites. At the same time as GVL of allogeneic T lymphocytes is strengthened by FBTA05 engagement the risks for GVHD development are reduced. Therefore, by adding FBTA05 to the established allogeneic DLI treatment regime patients may even benefit more from this combined therapeutic approach. Furthermore, FBTA05 should be given prior to DLI administration to allow the already bound anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trAbs FBTA05 to attract incoming allogeneic T lymphocytes directly to the CD20-expressing tumor cells. In other words, this treatment setting may favor GVL enhancement by simultaneously minimizing GVHD risks. This application sequence may be also important to control cytokine release due the increased number of CD3+ T target cells of FBTA05 in the blood circulation after DLI infusion. The opposite application order for FBTA05 and DLI would not mediate this positive effect of pre-coating tumor cells with trAb FBTA05 in vivo for attracting incoming allogeneic T lymphocytes. Moreover, preclinical and first clinical data confirmed this beneficial sequence for FBTA05 and DLI application. The present trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational trAb FBTA05 in combination with DLI for treatment of relapsed or refractory disease in CD20 positive CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL after allogeneic transplantation. The primary objective is the determination of the MTD of FBTA05 in phase I (dose-escalation part). In phase II (efficacy part), it is the preliminary evaluation of efficacy of a treatment schedule with FBTA05 and DLI in patients with CD20 positive either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL after allo-SCT. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of safety and pharmacodynamics of FBTA05 in combination with DLI, the induction of cellular immunity in terms of GVL or GVHD, and the determination of further efficacy data in terms of time to progression (TTP), duration of response and clinical benefit. The primary endpoint in Phase I is the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), in phase II the objective response rate. ',\n"," 'The secondary endpoints are safety and efficacy. Regarding safety, the recommended dose of FBTA05 in combination with DLI for further efficacy studies will be determined. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), the presence of HAMAs after FBTA05 application, the need to discontinue FBTA05 infusion, vital functions, the physical examination findings, laboratory parameters, concomitant medication and as pharmacodynamic endpoints the serum levels of cytokines will be recorded. In terms of efficacy the clinical benefit rate, the duration of response, the time to progression, the overall survival, the ECOG performance status, the tumor specific response, lymphocyte subsets, activation signs and memory status of T cells will be analysed. To evaluate differences in drug response to CLL/low grade NHL or high grade NHL, patients are enrolled into study cohorts according to their respective disease entity (either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL). As shown in Figure 2, the complete treatment course consists of a drug induction part (safety part) with defined FBTA05 doses of 10 mug on day 0, 20 mug on day 3 and 50 mug on day 7, as well as a drug maintenance / escalation part (course I and II, see also Table 1). The final antibody infusion of each part is followed by a dose-escalated application of donor lymphocytes. Each cohort includes at least 2 patients. In a strict sequential order, treatment and dose escalation (cohort A-D, Table 1) is performed independently for each disease entity (either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL). Thus, treatment of any subsequent patient 2 or 3 at a certain dose level will be started only after the safety part treatment of the previous patient of the same disease entity is completed, and the External Safety Board (ESB), acting as a Dose Steering Board (DSB), agrees to the enrolment of the next patient. The same dose escalation procedure will be applied throughout the study for all Cohorts (A-D). If one dose-limiting toxicity is seen, a total of 3 patients of the same disease entity must be treated at that dose level. If two dose-limiting toxicities are seen at any dose level, treatment for this disease entity is terminated and the MTD will be established at the next lower dosing level. If 2 of 3 patients of the same disease entity in Cohort A show dose-limiting toxicities, the MTD has been reached and lower dose levels may have to be investigated. ',\n"," 'After the phase I part of the study an interim analysis will be performed. Based on the outcome of this analysis the recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part will be proposed by the ESB and the investigators on the basis of the MTD and any other relevant safety issues. The recommended dose will not exceed the maximal dose foreseen in the protocol approved by the competent authority. The report of the interim analysis with the recommended dose will be presented to the ethics committee and competent authority. A maximum of 6 patients per disease entity will receive treatment during phase II. If the last Cohort at MTD level in phase I already included 2 or 3 patients for CLL/low grade NHL, respectively high-grade NHL, an additional 4 or 3 patients per disease entity will be enrolled in phase II. There will be a maximum of 24 patients in the MTD evaluation part of phase I: 12 patients for CLL / low-grade NHL, 12 patients for high-grade NHL. There will be a maximum of 12 patients in phase II of the study: 6 patients for CLL / low-grade NHL, 6 patients for HG-NHL. A total of maximal 30 patients will be included in the study. Patients of both genders, any ethnic origin and at least 18 years old are included in the study if they meet the criteria given in Table 2. All participating patients have to sign the written informed consent. Patients can be withdrawn from the study for medical reasons at any time and must be withdrawn in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity. Patients can recall their consent at any time without any negative implications for their further treatment. The investigational drug FBTA05 is provided by the TRION Pharma GmbH (Munich, Germany) as a sterile, pyrogen-free, color-free and preservative-free solution for infusion. The concentrate contains 0.2 mg/ml antibody per 100mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6), with 0.02% Tween 80. Depending on the dose level, FBTA05 is further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution for i.v. infusion. FBTA05 is administered with a constant rate over 6 hours by intravenous (i.v.) infusion. To avoid infusion reactions typically occurring after i.v. antibody infusions, i.v. Paracetamol (1,000 mg) and i.v. Dimetinden (4 mg) are administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of infusion. Three hours after the start of FBTA05 infusion, i.v. Paracetamol (500 - 1,000 mg) is repeated. ',\n"," 'Post-infusion, Paracetamol and Dimetinden are administered, as needed. In phase I, each patient (cohort A - D) will undergo the same safety part and receive induction doses of FBTA05 on day 0 (10 mug), day 3 (20 mug) and day 7 (50 mug). During the maintenance part, FBTA05 applications are scheduled for course I on day 14 (+- 1 day), 21 (+- 1 day), 28 (+- 1 day) and 35 (+- 1 day), for course II on day 42 (+- 1 day), 49(+- 1 day), 56 (+- 1 day) and 63 (+- 1 day). Thereby dose escalation of FBTA05 will be performed according to the respective Cohort A - D (Table 1). Donor lymphocyte infusion is scheduled in each cohort at the end of the safety part (day 7), as well as at the end of course I (day 35) and course II (day 63). The numbers of infused T cells are escalated according to the respective preparative regimen applied for allo-SCT as shown in Table 3. DLI will not be performed in case the of GVHD or active infection at the time of DLI, or in the rare cases that DLI is not available for technical reasons. In this case antibody application will be continued as scheduled without DLI. In phase II the recommended dose will be applied according to the respective treatment schedule as determined in phase I. Patients are required to complete screening procedures and 14 treatment visits (11 applications of FBTA05; 3 applications of DLI), so far as the dosage regimen is tolerated according to MTD assessments. Two weeks after the last infusion (week 12), patients will attend an end-of-study visit (EOS). In follow up, patients will attend 4 additional post-study follow-up visits (6, 9, 12 and 24 months after start of treatment). Patients enrolled in phase II will follow the identical screening, treatment and post-study follow-up schedule as for phase I. An ESB, composed of three independent experienced clinical experts is responsible for the evaluation of the patients. Together with the investigators they decide, whether individual patients may continue the study, and whether or not dose escalation can be applied. The ESB is involved in the assessment and declaration of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) as well as the evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). ',\n"," 'Moreover, based on the results of the interim analysis at the end of the phase I, the ESB together with the investigators will propose the recommended dose (RD) for phase II. The condition for a DLT is fulfilled in the case of termination of treatment due to an adverse reaction. Thereby, the treatment schedule for a patient must be terminated if any toxicity grade >= 3, condition or adverse event (e.g. body temperature >= Grade 3 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) (40 C), systolic BP < 75 or > 210 mm Hg, pulse < 50 or > 150 bpm or a dyspnoea grade IV) does not normalize within 3 hours. Furthermore, treatment will be terminated in case of an anaphylactic reaction, including, but not limited to severe angioedema, severe bronchospasm, severe urticaria or anaphylactic shock which occurs during the infusion. An adverse reaction, including clinical conditions of CTC Grade >= 3 or clinically relevant laboratory abnormality of CTC Grade >= 3 which occurs after the infusion and does not resolve until the planned date of the next infusion will also be grounds for termination of treatment. To assure the safety of the study patients a substantial examination program is performed. The patients are under hospital surveillance at least 1 hour prior to infusion and for 24 hours after the start of infusion. Physical examinations are performed at all scheduled visits and vital parameters (e.g. blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen-saturation and body temperature) are monitored throughout the infusion time until 24 hours after start of infusion. Moreover, patients are evaluated with regard to clinical signs, symptoms (including AEs) and subjective well-being. Laboratory parameters for safety analysis and immune monitoring are evaluated at every study visit. Moreover, during treatment, blood will be drawn prior to the start of infusion, at the end of the 6-hour drug infusion period and at 24 after the start of infusion. Blood chemistry parameters include sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, bilirubin (total), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, or SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, or SGPT) gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphastase, antithrombin III, albumin, creatinine, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), quick prothrombin time, fibrinogen and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Hematology parameters encompass hematocrit, hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, reticulocytes, platelets and differential WBC. ',\n"," 'An extensive immune monitoring program determines lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8 T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes) including effector, central memory as well as regulatory T cells and cytokine release profiles comprising interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Experimental ELISPOT-analysis to evaluate the induction of tumor specific immune responses after treatment with FBTA05 is restricted to CLL samples. Bone marrow biopsies are done before the start of treatment, moreover at the EOS and, 12 and 24 months after the start of therapy. Disseminated tumor cells will be determined by analyzing bone marrow aspirates taken from the iliac crest. Changes in the presence of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow will be assessed according to NCI criteria. Tumor assessment via imaging techniques (sonography, compute tomography, magnetic resonance tomography or positron-emission tomography) is clinical practise for the advanced stage of disease and will be performed at the screening, end of study visit and follow up visits scheduled 6, 9, 12 and 24 month after onset of the study. Assessment will be done according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The study is exploratory and is not powered to address any predefined hypotheses. The safety analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least one FBTA05 infusion. The efficacy analysis will be performed on both the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least the first three infusions and the first DLI (safety part). Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by use of appropriate descriptive techniques. The FBTA05 trial is supported by the Bavarian Immunotherapy Network (BayImmuNet) and the Munich m4-Biotech Cluster.

',\n"," 'Before start of the trial, the trial protocol, informed consent document and any other trial documents were submitted to the independent ethics committee and the regulatory authority (Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, PEI). Ethics approval was granted on 14 January 2010, PEI approval on 16 July 2010. The trial protocol was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov and was given the number NCT01138579. The procedures set out in this trial protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation and documentation of this trial, are designed to ensure that all persons involved in the trial abide by Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles described in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial will be carried out in keeping with local legal and regulatory requirements. The idea to redirect immunity via bispecific antibodies is currently one of the most compelling concepts in cancer treatment. In the meantime, various bispecific antibody formats have entered clinical trials indicating their enormous therapeutic potential. In the present phase I/II trial, the anti-CD3 x anti-CD20 trAb FBTA05 is applied in combination with DLI in patients with CD20-positive CLL, low- and high-grade NHL relapsed or refractory after allo-SCT. The primary goal of this combined FBTA05/DLI treatment approach is to further improve an already successful allogeneic DLI regime for patients with resistant B cell malignancies who relapsed after allo-SCT. In addition, Riechelmann and co-workers showed that opsonization of autologous effector cells (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells) with anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 trAb catumaxomab led to beneficial results (i.e. tolerability, safety and response) in patients with intractable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Based on these findings and anticipating our own preliminary clinical data from a small pilot study, the planned treatment schedule is designed to enhance the targeting of tumor cells by allogeneic T lymphocytes while reducing the risk of undesirable GVHD reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD as already shown in preclinical models. Of note, these studies about the enhancement of graft-versus-tumor effects and the reduction of GVHD by means of combined DLI/trAb application was thoroughly performed upon administration of C57 splenocytes with or without pretreatment of anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 trAb BiLu in (BALB x C57BL/6) F1 H-2d/b mice that were previously inoculated with a lethal dose of B16-EpCAM melanoma cells. Importantly, the C57 spleen cells were syngeneic to the B16-EpCAM tumor cells, but haploidentically mismatched to host cells. ',\n"," 'Treatment with BiLu protected recipient mice from the alloreactive C57 splenocytes, as GVHD-related death was observed in only 20% of mice whereas almost all mice inoculated with naive C57 splenocytes w/o BiLu pretreatment died of GVHD. In total 50% of all treated mice were disease-free in this experimental settings. BiLu treatment w/o cell therapy also had a substantial anti-tumor effect, as a similar proportion of treated mice were disease-free under these conditions. Thus, future trials could also address the feasibility to pass on DLI in relevant clinical settings. Here, this clinical study with a combined trAb/DLI treatment might provide further insights into the capacity of this therapeutic regime to deplete malignant B cells, activate the immune system and induce secondary cell-mediated immunity.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01105247.) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. Therapy for symptomatic CLL has consisted predominantly of chemotherapeutic agents, including chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and combinations of these agents that are effective for palliation but do not improve survival. The addition of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to chemotherapy (fludarabine alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide) results in higher response rates, extended remissions, and improved overall survival. However, a subgroup of patients with deletion of 17p13.1 have a poor response to chemoimmunotherapy, and patients with tumors expressing unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain genes have shorter remissions than those with mutated genes. Furthermore, chemoimmunotherapy is not curative, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased toxicity and reduced antitumor activity. Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, CLL lacks a common genetic target. However, B-cell-receptor signaling has emerged as a driving factor for CLL tumor-cell survival. \",\n"," \"Downstream of the B-cell receptor and of critical importance to its function is a member of the Tec family of kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK mutations in humans cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which leads to the absence of peripheral-blood B cells, decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin, and increased susceptibility to infections. BTK is essential for activation of several constitutively active pathways of CLL-cell survival, including the Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathways. In addition, BTK is essential to chemokine-mediated homing and adhesion of B cells. Given the importance of B-cell-receptor signaling in CLL and the central role of BTK in this pathway, an attractive strategy is to target inhibition of this kinase. Ibrutinib (Pharmacyclics) is an orally bioavailable, potent inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.5 nM) that covalently binds to the cysteine-481 amino acid of the BTK enzyme. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib treatment inhibits numerous processes, including ERK signaling, NF-kappaB DNA binding, cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-mediated CLL-cell proliferation, and tumor-cell migration. Ibrutinib does not have toxic effects on normal T cells; this distinguishes it from most regimens used for CLL. A phase 1 study of ibrutinib showed mild-to-moderate toxicity and clinical antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell cancers; 11 of the 16 patients in the study had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. These preliminary results prompted the initiation of a phase 1b-2 study of ibrutinib in CLL; this study involved two different therapeutic doses in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Eligibility criteria included the following: a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as defined according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and World Health Organization classifications; a need for treatment; adequate renal and hepatic function, defined by a creatinine level of no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and an alanine aminotransferase level of no more than 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range; and an absence of active infection. The first and second cohorts were required to have received at least two previous therapies, including a purine analogue. A third cohort was composed of patients with high-risk disease that did not respond to a chemoimmunotherapy regimen or that progressed within 24 months after completion of the regimen. \",\n"," 'neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter were required initially. However, an amendment to the protocol allowed enrollment of 22 patients with any degree of cytopenia if it was due to bone marrow involvement. Exclusion criteria were any type of cancer that limited survival to less than 2 years, gastrointestinal disease that might inhibit ibrutinib absorption, and medicines associated with torsades de pointes. Testing to detect interphase cytogenetic abnormalities, immunoglobulin-gene mutational analysis, and measurement of beta2-microglobulin levels were performed during the screening period by a central reference laboratory. This phase 1b-2, open-label, multicenter study was designed to determine the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. In addition, we sought to examine the influence of features of a poor prognosis on the clinical response to ibrutinib. An institutional review board approved the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) at each study site. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent. The study is ongoing. Two cohorts of patients (27 patients in cohort 1 and 24 patients in cohort 3) were assigned to receive a fixed daily dose of 420 mg of ibrutinib, and one cohort (34 patients in cohort 2) was assigned to receive a daily dose of 840 mg, with both doses administered orally on a continuous schedule until the onset of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment in the three cohorts occurred consecutively from May 2010 through August 2011. On the basis of early data from cohort 1, cohort 3 was added to study the effect of 420 mg in patients with high-risk disease. The primary end point was the safety of the two fixed-dose regimens, assessed according to the frequency and severity of adverse events. Safety monitoring, which included a clinical history taking, physical examination, and laboratory tests, was performed weekly for the first month, every other week for the second month, and monthly thereafter. Adverse events were graded with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf). Hematologic toxic effects were graded according to the system of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (2008). ',\n"," \"The secondary end points were the overall response rate, progression-free survival, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. A response assessment that included a radiologic examination was performed at the end of cycles 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 24. A bone marrow biopsy was performed to confirm a complete response. The response in patients with CLL was evaluated according to the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with the exception that lymphocytosis was not the sole criterion for disease progression (a summary of the response criteria is available in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). For patients with persistent lymphocytosis, a partial response in all other measures was characterized as a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response in patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma was evaluated according to the International Working Group criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2007). Putative biomarkers of response and overall survival were exploratory end points. We conducted pharmacokinetic studies to determine the exposure to ibrutinib after treatment at both dose levels. The pharmacokinetic measures were derived from the nominal plasma concentration-time curves. Pharmacodynamic testing was performed to assess the level of drug binding to BTK (BTK occupancy) after treatment. A cell-permeable, fluorescently tagged derivative of ibrutinib was used to visualize BTK before treatment and 4 and 24 hours after treatment, as previously described. The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics and Janssen. All the authors and the sponsors were responsible for designing the study protocol and analysis plan. All the authors and their respective research teams collected all the data, and the sponsors confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled it for summation and analysis. The authors had full access to the data and analyses for compilation of this report. Manuscript drafts were prepared by the authors with editorial assistance from a professional medical writer paid by Janssen. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of the study to the protocol, and all the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for discrete variables, were used to summarize the findings in each of the defined cohorts. All analyses included patients who received the study drug. The overall response rate with a 95% confidence interval was calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for time-to-event analysis (curves and corresponding quartiles). \",\n"," \"Data on progression-free survival were censored when patients received new anticancer therapy or at the last clinical assessment, for patients who were lost to follow-up. No imputation of missing values was performed. In an exploratory analysis, characteristics associated with response and progression-free survival and overall survival were compared by means of Fisher's exact test in each subgroup. Analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. A total of 85 patients were enrolled at eight sites. The baseline characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1, and in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. The patients, who were generally considered to have high-risk disease, had received a median of four previous therapies. A total of 65% of the patients had advanced-stage disease, 33% had 17p13.1 deletions, and 36% had 11q22.3 deletions. At a median follow-up of 20.9 months (range, 0.7 to 26.7), 54 patients (64%) were still receiving treatment, and 31 (36%) had discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation (detailed in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix) included disease progression in 11 patients (13%); the patient's or investigator's decision in 13 (15%), of whom 5 patients then underwent stem-cell transplantation; and adverse events in 7 patients (8%), including 3 patients who had pneumonia, 2 who had sepsis, 1 who had staphylococcal bacteremia without physiological signs of sepsis, and 1 who had gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The steady-state concentration-time profiles of ibrutinib after administration of 420 mg or 840 mg per day are shown in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The exposure to ibrutinib increased proportionally from a dose of 420 to 840 mg per day. No differences in the time to the peak ibrutinib concentration in the blood (median Tmax, 2 hours [range, 0.5 to 6]) or the terminal half-life (7.8+-3.6 hours with 420 mg per day and 8.1+-3.4 hours with 840 mg per day) were apparent between doses. Post-treatment assessments indicated full occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib at both dose levels. The median level of BTK occupancy was 96 to 99% (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix); it was observed as early as 4 hours after the dose was administered and was maintained 24 hours after the dose was administered, at both dose levels. Long-term therapy with ibrutinib was associated with modest toxicity; most adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 2). \",\n"," 'The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection, and most adverse events resolved without the need for a suspension of treatment. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2 patients in the 420-mg cohort (4%) and in 4 patients in the 840-mg cohort (12%). Serious adverse events are listed in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were pneumonia (in 10 patients [12%]) and dehydration (in 5 patients [6%]). Infections of grade 3 or higher occurred most frequently early in the course of therapy. The average rate of infection was 7.1 per 100 patient-months during the first 6 months and 2.6 per 100 patient-months thereafter (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The exposure-adjusted rate of infections that were grade 3 or higher was reduced by more than half after 6 months of treatment (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). IgG and IgM levels remained relatively stable throughout treatment, whereas IgA levels increased at 3, 6, and 12 months (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects were infrequent; 5 patients (6%) had anemia, 13 patients (15%) had neutropenia, and 5 patients (6%) had thrombocytopenia. Bleeding events that were grade 3 or higher in severity occurred in 4 patients. A total of 8 patients died within 30 days after receiving the last dose of ibrutinib: 3 deaths were from pneumonia, 1 was from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 1 was from sarcoma, and 3 were related to CLL progression. The overall response rate based on the standard criteria was 71% (2 complete responses and 34 partial responses) in the 420-mg cohort and 71% (24 partial responses) in the 840-mg cohort. In addition, 10 patients in the 420-mg cohort (20%) and 5 patients in the 840-mg cohort (15%) had a partial response with persistent lymphocytosis. Blood lymphocytosis was generally noted by day 7 (in 78% of the patients); it peaked at a median of 4 weeks and then slowly declined. In 50 of 63 patients (79%), the lymphocyte count normalized (absolute lymphocyte count, <4x109 cells per cubic millimeter) or was reduced by 50% from the baseline level. Treatment-related lymphocytosis developed at similar frequencies in patients with unmutated and those with mutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain genes (77% and 83%, respectively). ',\n"," \"However, in patients with unmutated immunoglobulin genes, lymphocyte counts normalized more rapidly (median, 6.4 vs. 14.8 months) and more frequently (in 85% vs. 50% of the patients). Lymphocytosis occurred concomitantly with a notable reduction in lymph-node size (Fig. 1A) and spleen size, as well as frequent improvement in cytopenias (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). An improved response was time-dependent (Fig. 1B); increasing numbers of partial responses and complete responses occurred during follow-up, whereas the frequency of a partial response with lymphocytosis diminished as the lymphocyte count decreased over time. As shown in Figure 2, the response to ibrutinib did not appear to vary according to traditional high-risk prognostic features. The response rate among the patients with a 17p13.1 deletion was 68%, including one complete response, whereas the response rate was 71% among those without this deletion. The only factor associated with a response was the mutation status of the immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene. Notably, 4 of the 12 patients with a mutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene (33%) had a partial response or complete response and 5 (42%) had a partial response with lymphocytosis. By contrast, 53 of the 69 patients with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene (77%) had a partial response or complete response and 9 (13%) had a partial response with lymphocytosis. This difference in the overall response rate (partial response plus complete response) was significant (P = 0.005), whereas the combined overall response rate plus the rate of partial response with lymphocytosis did not differ significantly according to mutation status. Sustained improvement in cytopenias, defined as improvement by more than 50% or a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g per deciliter, an absolute neutrophil count higher than 1500 cells per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count higher than 100,000 cells per cubic millimeter (lasting for >=2 cycles without transfusion or administration of growth factors), was frequently observed during ibrutinib treatment (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Improvement was observed in 32 of 41 patients with baseline thrombocytopenia (78%), 27 of 33 with anemia (82%), and 24 of 31 with neutropenia (77%). Ibrutinib treatment promoted durable responses, irrespective of the dose. The 26-month estimated rate of progression-free survival (Fig. 3A, top graph) was 75%, and the rate of overall survival (Fig. 3B, top graph) was 83%. Disease progression developed in 11 patients (13%) during follow-up, and 7 of those patients had progression by biologic transformation (Richter's syndrome). \",\n"," 'The median time from the initial diagnosis of CLL to transformation was 98 months (range, 24 to 143). Among the 11 patients in whom progressive disease developed, 10 patients had a 17p13.1 or a 11q22.3 deletion, and 1 patient did not have high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (Fig. 3A). Patients had a prolonged time to progression despite high-risk genomic features. Among the 28 patients with a 17p13.1 deletion : a uniformly poor prognostic factor : the 26-month estimated rate of progression-free survival (Fig. 3A) was 57% and the rate of overall survival (Fig. 3B) was 70%. Patients who discontinued ibrutinib for reasons other than progression remained in the study and were followed quarterly until disease progression, the initiation of new anticancer therapy, or death. After disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, follow-up was limited to survival status. Treatment at the time of new treatment initiation was left to the discretion of the treating physician. The responses to ibrutinib, the covalent inhibitor of BTK, that we observed in this study were more durable than expected on the basis of previous experience with other single-agent therapies for relapsed CLL. At both doses of ibrutinib that we studied, pharmacokinetic data showed rapid absorption and elimination. Moreover, pharmacodynamic data showed that once-daily ibrutinib provided effective and complete occupancy of BTK, a surrogate of kinase inhibition. Ibrutinib caused a transient increase in blood lymphocyte levels, which was concurrent with a reduction in lymph-node size, spleen size, or both. Continued treatment with ibrutinib led to resolution of this asymptomatic lymphocytosis, and patients were characterized as having a classic response according to the 2008 criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with an observed response rate of 71%. Fifteen additional patients (18%) in this study had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Treatment-related lymphocytosis has been seen with other agents that target B-cell-receptor signaling; these findings have prompted several groups of CLL experts to conclude that such lymphocytosis is not a sign of progressive disease. Our findings provide support for an ibrutinib-mediated pharmacodynamic effect on CLL by cell mobilization from protected bone marrow, lymphnode, and spleen sites harboring stromal elements that have been shown to promote leukemic-cell proliferation, drug resistance, and survival. ',\n"," \"Despite the immunocompromised condition of the patients, who had received a median of four previous therapies, ibrutinib treatment did not result in an increased incidence of grade 3 or higher infections during the extended therapy period, as compared with the rates reported in several series of patients who received traditional salvage therapies. The incidence of infection was highest early in the course of ibrutinib treatment and decreased with continued therapy. During treatment, improvement in neutrophil counts occurred in patients with baseline neutropenia (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix), with significant increases in the level of serum IgA and no detrimental effects on IgG or IgM levels (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The analysis of immunoglobulin levels was limited to patients with relatively preserved immunoglobulin levels, since those who received intravenous immune globulin were excluded. The occurrence of ecchymosis, petechiae, or both was noted on the skin in a subgroup of patients who received ibrutinib, but these conditions were not accompanied by excess bleeding or associated with thrombocytopenia. Randomized trials comparing the safety profile of ibrutinib with that of other therapeutic agents for CLL are ongoing. These trials include A Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) Versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707) and A Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor PCI-32765 Versus Chlorambucil in Patients 65 Years or Older with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE-2, NCT01722487). Several validated high-risk characteristics of CLL, including 17p13.1 deletion, did not influence the objective response to ibrutinib. However, most events associated with disease progression occurred in patients with high-risk cytogenetic lesions (17p13.1 deletion or 11q22.3 deletion), whereas only one patient without these risk factors had an event associated with disease progression. Patients with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene, perhaps owing to enhanced B-cell-receptor signaling and dependence on this pathway, had earlier resolution of lymphocytosis and were more frequently classified as having a response according to traditional response criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (P = 0.02); however, survival outcomes were similar to those among patients without this unmutated gene. Greater than 90% occupancy of the pharmacodynamic probe and the similar response in the two dose groups provide support for the use of the 420-mg dose of ibrutinib for relapsed CLL. \",\n"," 'Ibrutinib has a favorable therapeutic index, which may facilitate its use in combination with other agents for the treatment of CLL. However, the durable remissions obtained thus far suggest that many patients may be treated successfully with monotherapy. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

The current study was done to test its utility in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Our preclinical investigations (lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with B-ALL [n=12]) demonstrate activity in vitro. Minimal activity in the clinic suggests that this agent should be used in combination with other established or novel ALL agents. The discovery that purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency leads to T-cell lymphopenia was the basis for introducing PNP inhibitors for T-cell leukemias. Forodesine is an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor with picomolar potency. Because T lymphoblasts and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics to accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), forodesine demonstrated promising activity in preclinical and clinical settings for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell CLL (B-CLL). However, the use of forodesine in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is unknown. Leukemic blasts obtained from pediatric patients with de novo B-ALL (n=10) were incubated with forodesine and deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and the biological end points of apoptosis, intracellular dGTP accumulation, and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis were measured. Additionally, adult patients with B-ALL (n= 2) were intravenously infused with 80 mg/m2/d daily for 5 days. After therapy, clinical response, toxicity, laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition, and plasma forodesine, dGuo, and intracellular dGTP levels were analyzed. Our in vitro investigations demonstrated that forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation and induced modest apoptosis in de novo B-ALL lymphoblasts. There was time-dependent accumulation of dGTP and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. During therapy, neither patient achieved a complete response (CR), but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. There was significant maintained inhibition of PNP enzyme in red blood cells, accumulation of forodesine and dGuo in plasma, and intracellular dGTP accumulation in both patients. Our preclinical and clinical investigations suggest that forodesine has activity in B-ALL. However, it needs to be either infused with dGuo or combined with established chemotherapeutic agents based on mechanistic rationale. The discovery of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, a metabolic disorder that results in congenital immunodeficiency in association with severe T-cell immune depletion, and the elucidation of its pathophysiologic characteristics provided the rationale for the development of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) analogs for leukemias. Because dGuo is readily catabolized by PNP, phar-macologic inhibition of this enzyme manifests a deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP)-mediated T-cell lymphopenia. ',\n"," 'Although T-cell-specific depletion was observed with dGuo, the efficient catabolism of dGuo by PNP limited its use clinically. Taken together, these data provided a rationale for the development of PNP-resistant dGuo analogs or PNP inhibitors for the treatment of leukemias. The PNP-resistant dGuo derivative arabinosylguanine (ara-G) is toxic to T lymphoblasts and resistant to degradation by endogenous PNP. Once within cells, ara-G is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase into ara-GTP. The resultant accumulation of intracellular ara-GTP inhibits DNA synthesis. Similar to dGuo, ara-G has shown antileukemic activity in T-lymphoblastic cell lines and in the clinic through a T-lymphoid lineage-specific accumulation of ara-GTP during therapy. A clinical trial conducted by the Childrens Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group of nelarabine, a prodrug of ara-G, in refractory T-cell leukemias and lymphomas demonstrated higher responses in T-ALL. Additionally, a phase II trial in patients with refractory T-cell malignancies demonstrated substantial single-agent activity, with an objective response rate of more than 50% in the subset of patients with T-cell leukemia. Of note, some activity was also seen in patients with B-lineage disease. Forodesine (also known as BCX-1777/immucillin H) was developed as an orally bioavailable novel PNP transition-state inhibitor with a low picomolar inhibitory constant for human enzymes. The principal requisite for this agent to demonstrate its action relies on complete inhibition (> 95%) of the PNP enzyme and subsequent accumulation of dGTP, the intracellular metabolite of substrate dGuo. Forodesine exhibited cytotoxicity in T-cell leukemia cell lines through accumulation of large amounts of intracellular dGTP perturbing the cellular milieu. This in vitro activity in cell lines provided the impetus to initiate a clinical study in patients with T-cell leukemia to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this inhibitor. In agreement with its preclinical activity, forodesine demonstrated promising activity in patients with T-cell leukemia through accumulation of dGuo in plasma and dGTP in leukemia cells. Forodesine is also effective against indolent B- and T-cell diseases (both in vitro and in clinical trials), as well as in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. With this background, we proposed to test forodesine in B-ALL based on the following rationale. First, akin to T cells, inhibition of PNP promotes accumulation of dGTP, subsequent imbalance in the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and eventually cell death in B cells. Second, T-cell therapies such as nelarabine have demonstrated clinical activity in B-cell leukemias. ',\n"," 'have demonstrated clinical activity in B-cell leukemias. Third, B cells have high levels of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the enzyme that facilitates the accumulation of dGTP. Fourth, the rate-limiting enzyme dCK that converts dGuo to dGTP is present in high levels in pediatric lymphoblasts. Finally, forodesine has demonstrated some activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of forodesine in B-ALL. Given that B cells contain high levels of dCK, we hypothesized that this agent could sensitize B-ALL lymphoblasts to apoptosis. Our preclinical studies with 12 pediatric patients with de novo acute leukemia (most had B-ALL [10 patients] with 1 each T-ALL and acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) and extended studies on clinical evaluation of adult patients with B-ALL (n = 2) provide the rationale for utility of this agent in B-cell leukemias. Forodesine for clinical use was provided by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL). For quantitation of deoxynucleotides, dNTPs were obtained from Amersham/GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Pittsburgh, PA) and were used as standards. [3H]deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and [3H]deoxythymidine triphosphate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham, MA) and MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA), respectively. This project consists of reports from 2 studies: in vitro investigations in blasts from de novo pediatric acute leukemia with forodesine (n=12) and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluations of forodesine in adult patients with B-ALL (n=2) during therapy. Among pediatric patients, the majority were patients with active B-ALL (B-ALL [n=10]; acute myelogenous leukemia [AML] [n=1]; acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL] [n=1]). Whole blood or bone marrow was collected in heparinized tubes from pediatric patients with leukemia at initial diagnosis. The specimen was diluted 1:3 with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.135 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4 [pH 7.4]) and layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque (specific gravity, 1.086; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The blood was then centrifuged at 433g for 20 minutes, and mononuclear cells were removed from the interphase. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 10 mL RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The isolated lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo in a culture incubator at 37 C. These concentrations were selected based on plasma pharmacologic data obtained during a phase I study of forodesine. ',\n"," \"Cultures were maintained and aliquots (1x107 cells/mL) were removed at the end of incubation times. A Coulter channelyzer (Coulter Electronics) was used to determine cell number and mean cell volume. These cells were measured for intracellular dNTP, macromolecule syntheses, and apoptosis levels. The lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo. Cultures were maintained and aliquots (1x107 cells/mL) were removed at the end of incubation times (24 or 48 hours). Percent apoptosis was measured by annexin V binding assay (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, fresh cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 microL of 1xannexin binding buffer obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), at a concentration of 1x10 cells/mL. Annexin V:fluorescein isothiocyanate (5 microL) was added, and the cells were incubated in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature. Ten microliters (50 microg/mL) propidium iodide was then added to the labeled cells and analyzed immediately with a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data from at least 10,000 events per sample were recorded and processed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). The lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo for indicated time points (24 or 48 hours), and the global DNA and RNA syntheses were measured by [3H] thymidine and [3H]uridine incorporation assays. Before removal of the aliquot, 10 microCi/mL [3H]thymidine or [3H]uridine was added to these cultures, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 minutes. The labeled cells were then extracted using perchloric acid, and the pellets were incubated overnight with KOH at 37 C to dissolve DNA and RNA, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). PNP inhibition was measured by spectrophotometric assay. Erythrocytes were separated from whole blood and PNP was extracted from red blood cells by cell hemolysis. Addition of the substrate inosine results in conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine by PNP. Hypoxanthine is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase to form a stable product, uric acid. The accumulation of uric acid is quantitatively determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 293 nm. The observed data are then normalized by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm, which represents the number of erythrocytes used to prepare the PNP extract. \",\n"," 'The inhibitory effect was calculated using the equation [1 :(PNP activity post dose/PNP activity pre dose)] x 100. Blood samples (10 mL) before and after treatment at indicated days were obtained in green-stopper Vacutainer tubes containing heparin and 50 microM BCX-3424 (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals) as an internal control. The plasma was removed after centrifugation and stored at :70 C and analyzed at BioCryst Pharmaceuticals. Plasma dGuo and forodesine were analyzed as described previously using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Briefly, BCX-1777 was extracted from plasma using a phenylboronic acid affinity solid-phase extraction cartridge and dGuo was extracted from plasma using a Waters Oasis HLB affinity solid-phase extraction cartridge (Waters Corp, Milford, MA). The mass of BCX-1777 plus H+ (267.1 m/z) and the mass of dGuo plus H+ (268.1 m/z) are monitored in quadrupole 1. The BCX-1777 product ion 148.0 m/z and the dGuo product ion 157.0 m/z are monitored in quadrupole 3. The concentrations of forodesine and dGuo were determined by weighted (1/x) quadratic regression analysis of peak areas produced from the standard curve. Cells incubated in vitro with dGuo and forodesine were collected at different time points (24 or 48 hours at 37 C). Similarly, blood samples were obtained from patients at different time points during treatment with forodesine, and leukemic blasts were isolated. The nucleotides in the blast cells were extracted by 60% methanol as described previously, and the dNTPs were quantitated in these cell extracts by DNA polymerase assay as described by Sherman and Fyfe. Patients were eligible to participate if they had failed at least 1 previous treatment regimen for B-ALL. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or better, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, adequate organ function with aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels micro<=3 times the upper limit of normal, and calculated creatinine clearance > 40 mL/min. Female patients had to have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 to 7 days before the start of the study, and all patients had to be free of active or uncontrolled infection, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis viruses. Patients signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center before participation in the study. ',\n"," 'Blood samples were collected on the pretreatment day and on days 1 through 4 on cycles 1 to 3, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined. The clinical trial was a phase I/II open-label multicenter study of forodesine hydrochloride in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL, with the primary end point of assessing the safety of repeated intravenous doses of forodesine hydrochloride. Secondary end points included assessment of the efficacy of the drug in this disease, as well as evaluation of the steady-state pharmacokinetics and correlating pharmacodynamic parameters with any potential response. Patients were to receive 4 weeks of treatment with 5 days of intravenous dosing each week. Patients having clinical response (defined as achieving complete response [CR], CR without platelet recovery, partial response, or stable disease) could receive an additional 4 weeks of treatment with forodesine. Patients were evaluated for grades 3 and 4 non-hematologic toxicity and grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Forodesine treatment would be delayed or dosage reduced depending on the recovery from toxicity. All data were graphed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance (a value of .05) was determined by the 2-tailed paired Student t test. Characteristics of patients enrolled in the in vitro study are provided in Table 1 (pediatric B-ALL [n = 10]; T-ALL [n = 1]; AML [n = 1]; adult B-ALL [n = 2; No. 9001, No. 9002]). When measured by annexin/propidium iodide binding assay (Figure 1), in samples from 8 patients tested, there was heterogeneity in response to forodesine ranging from 2% to 40% apoptosis (normalized to time-matched control), with median 10% apoptosis. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant induction of apoptosis in these cells compared with untreated controls (Figure 1A, Figure 24 hours; P = .018; Figure 1B, Figure 48 hours; P = .041). There was no significant amount of apoptosis in the sample from patient 3, a patient with AML, compared with other patients with B-ALL. We do not have cytotoxicity data for patient 8, a patient with T-ALL. There was significant accumulation of dGTP in these cells, ranging between 3 and 90 microM, with a median 16 microM (24 hours; P = .045; n = 9; Figure 2A) after forodesine and dGuo treatment compared with time-matched controls (Figure 2B; Figure 48 hours). In particular, patient 8, who was diagnosed with T-ALL, showed 3-fold higher accumulation of dGTP levels compared with patients with B-ALL. ',\n"," 'When measured for dATP levels, there was no difference in accumulation between controls and treated samples (Figure 2C), which is consistent with our previous studies in T-cell leukemias. In general, cancer cells, including leukemic cells, are known to sustain their function through active DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. To test if for-odesine can potentially inhibit these macromolecule syntheses in these lymphoblasts as a result of perturbation of the dGTP pool, we performed [3H]uridine and [3H] thymidine incorporation assays to measure their levels of inhibition. Although samples varied in response to forodesine, there was significant inhibition of RNA synthesis at 24 hours (Figure 3A; n = 5; P = .015). For DNA synthesis, there was inhibition observed in 3 of 5 patients; however, the statistical analysis by 2-tailed t test did not show significance (Figure 3B; P = .0675). Samples 3a and 6a were collected at 48 hours for these patients. Of note, the values given are absolute disintegrations per minute values, and one can observe the variations in the basal levels of macromolecule synthesis between different patient samples. Two patients were treated with forodesine at 80 mg/m2/day daily for 5 days through 3 cycles. The study was closed early for slow accrual, and as such no further patients with B-ALL were treated. The first patient, a 61-year-old woman with precursor B-ALL, received initial therapy with the hyperCVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine [Oncovin], doxorubicin [Adriamycin], dexamethasone) regimen plus rituximab and achieved a CR after 2 courses of treatment but had disease relapse within 5 months. She went on to receive multiple salvage regimens, including augmented hyper-CVAD, liposomal vincristine, liposomal annamycin, combination high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate with alemtuzumab and rituximab, without achieving a response. She was then enrolled in the study and received 3 cycles of forodesine, with disease progression on day 8 of the third cycle, and treatment was discontinued. Five days later, she was hospitalized for progressive shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic pain and died of the complications of her disease and infection. The second patient was a 23-year-old woman with precursor B-ALL and t(4;11) who achieved CR after receiving 2 courses of the hyperCVAD regimen. She then underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an HIA-matched sibling after a preparative regimen of total body irradiation, etoposide, and rituximab. Her disease relapsed after transplantation and she received salvage therapy with liposomal vincristine and dexamethasone without a response. ',\n"," 'She completed 1 cycle of forodesine but experienced intracranial hemorrhage shortly after the initiation of cycle 2 and died of the associated complications. In summary, neither patient achieved a CR, but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. The pretreatment and end of infusion samples were collected between days 1 and 5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of week 2 and week 3. The red blood cells were isolated from whole blood, and the cells were processed to determine percent PNP inhibition in these samples. The inhibition of PNP for patient No. 9001 before therapy was 0% and increased to a median of 84% of inhibition (range 76%-95%) (Figure 4). Because accumulation of dGTP is promoted by PNP inhibition, > 90% PNP inhibition is required for this agent to be efficacious. Assessment of PNP inhibition for patient No. 9002 was not performed. To determine if forodesine was at steady-state level, we next measured the plasma forodesine levels during therapy in these 2 patients. Forodesine levels were quantitated on day 0 and at the end of infusion between days 1 and 5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of week 2 and week 3 (n = 2). For patient No. 9001 (Figure 5A; solid line), on day 0 the forodesine level was 0 microM and increased to 12 microM on day 1. By day 2, the level dropped to 2 microM before infusion and increased to 12 microM at the end of infusion. The pattern was very similar between pretreatment and end of infusion. For patient No. 9002 (Figure 5A; dashed line) the pattern was similar; however, the levels were almost half that of the other patient. The levels increased to 6 microM (range 4.7-6.7 microM) and dropped to 1 microM (range 0.21-2.3 microM) after treatment. These forodesine levels were comparatively higher than those in the samples of the patient with B-CLL, in which the maximum was 1.3 microM. With these concentrations of plasma forodesine and levels of PNP inhibition, an increase in endogenous dGuo was expected. The level of dGuo in pretreatment samples for patient No. 9001 was less than the level of detection and increased to 22 microM and then further to 38 microM and was maintained at 12 microM on day 4 of week 3 (Figure 5B; solid line). ',\n"," \"For patient No. 9002, the levels were again lower, ranging from 7 to 12 microM (Figure 5B; dashed line). The starting level of intracellular dGTP for patient No. 9001 on day 0 of cycle 1 was 11 microM and increased to 18 microM by the end of infusion. On day 2, there was an increase to 270 microM, with further elevation to 310 microM at the end of infusion. This level was maintained until day 4 of cycle 1. By cycle 3, the levels dropped to 37 microM and were maintained through day 4 (Figure 6A). For patient No. 9002, the intracellular dGTP levels were 10-fold less, with a maximum level of 15 microM (Figure 6B), suggesting heterogeneity in the accumulation of dGTP between patients. ALL is the most common malignancy of childhood. Although the cure rates for childhood ALL are currently about 80%, the outcome of relapsed ALL remains dismal, with an overall survival of only 10% for patients with early bone marrow relapse or a second or subsequent relapse. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the mainstay of treatment for relapsed ALL. However, recurrence rates are as high as 90% for patients with morphologic evidence of residual disease going into HSCT. In addition, higher levels of pretransplantation minimal residual disease have been shown to predict relapse after HSCT. 34-36 To that end, novel agents with the ability to induce a minimal residual disease:negative remission are needed. Forodesine may also play an important role in the setting of recurrent T-cell ALL now that nelarabine is moving to frontline regimens for those with high-risk disease. However, the role of forodesine in B-cell ALL is not clear. Preclinical investigations in primary T-ALL and B-ALL cells from pediatric patients have demonstrated activity of forodesine and dGuo in B lymphoblasts. The lower activity in B-ALL was associated with less dGTP accumulation, which may result from a lower level of expression of nucleoside transporters in B cells and a higher level of 5'-nucleotidase. In contrast to other nucleoside analogs, dGuo, as well as ara-G, are phosphorylated by dGuo kinase as well as dCyd kinase. Furthermore, both dGuo and ara-G are preferred substrates for dGuo kinase compared with dCyd kinase. At the mRNA level, both these kinases are present at similar levels in T lymphoblasts and B lymphoblasts from children. \",\n"," 'However, levels of proteins and the activity of enzymes will also affect the level of accumulation of triphosphate. This may explain heterogeneity among patients to accumulate dGTP after 24 and 48 hours of incubation with for-odesine and dGuo (Figure 2 A and B). Although there was only a modest effect on cell death of B-leukemic lymphoblasts (Figure 1), there was inhibition of DNA synthesis, suggesting there could be an impact on the cell proliferative index (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in a B-lymphoblastic cell line with ara-G, in which some S-phase cells were killed but then cells were blocked in S-phase of the cell cycle. This is in contrast to T cells, in which a majority of cells in S phase were killed; this was followed by cell death in other phases of the cell cycle by activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Partial inhibition of proliferation with limited apoptosis has also been observed in myeloma cell lines: another B-cell neoplasm albeit mature plasma B cells. Forodesine is a potent inhibitor of PNP, the mRNA of which is present at slightly higher levels in B cells. Most of the PNP is in large body organs and red blood cells. At the physiologic dose in patients with B-ALL, there was more than 85% inhibition of this enzyme in red blood cells (Figure 4). This inhibition resulted in a peak of at least 10 mM of dGuo in plasma (Figure 5B), suggesting that the desired concentration of dGuo could be achieved in patients with B-ALL. However, only higher levels of dGuo (patient No. 9001) resulted in more than 200 microM dGTP in B lymphoblasts. Lower dGuo resulted in only 10 microM of dGTP (Figure 6). Collectively, these data suggest that forodesine will need to be infused with dGuo or combined with chemotherapeutic agents based on the mechanistic rationale to have clinically meaningful activity in B-ALL. Despite advances in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with ALL, disease relapses in a significant majority of the former and a minority of the latter. New agents are needed to improve the outcome of these patients. Inhibition of PNP leading to depletion of T cells has been demonstrated with forodesine, an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor that has been previously evaluated for its efficacy in patients with T-ALL. Aside from T-ALL, forodesine has also demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in indolent lymphoid neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ',\n"," 'The current study was conducted to evaluate the activity of this agent in B-ALL, using lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with B-ALL for in vitro analysis. Concurrently, a phase II study examined the role of this agent in various leukemias, including 2 adult patients with B-ALL. Although the limited data prohibit definitive conclusions, this study suggests that forodesine may be a useful agent for B-ALL only when used in combination with other agents. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

',\n"," 'New therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are needed, particularly those that can eradicate residual disease and elicit anti-CLL immune responses. CD40 ligation on CLL cells, which can be achieved using adenovirus encoding chimeric CD154 (Ad-ISF35), enhances their ability to function as antigen-presenting cells and increases their sensitivity to clearance by immune-effector mechanisms. In this study, we report the results of a first-in-man phase I trial of intranodal direct injection (IDI) of Ad-ISF35 in patients with CLL to evaluate toxicity, safety, and tolerability. Fifteen patients received a single IDI of 1 x 1010 to 33 x1010 Ad-ISF35 viral particles (vp), with a defined maximum tolerated dose as 1 x 1011 vp. Although the most common adverse events were transient grade 1 to 2 pain at the injection site and flu-like symptoms following IDI, some patients receiving the highest dose had transient, asymptomatic grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia, neutropenia, or transaminitis. Increased expression of death receptor, immune costimulatory molecules, and Ad-ISF35 vector DNA was detected in circulating CLL cells. Notably, we also observed preliminary clinical responses, including reductions in leukemia cell counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Six patients did not require additional therapy for more than 6 months, and three achieved a partial remission. In conclusion, Ad-ISF35 IDI was safely delivered in patients with CLLs and induced systemic biologic and clinical responses. These results provide the rationale for phase II studies in CLLs, lymphomas, and CD40-expressing solid tumors. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal B cells in the blood, lymphoid tissues, and marrow. Although advances in chemoimmunotherapy have resulted in improved response rates and have prolonged survival, such treatments can also impair hematopoiesis and immune function and are not well tolerated by all patients, particularly the elderly. Furthermore, most treated patients eventually relapse and require additional therapy and the disease still is considered incurable. It has been reported that the lymph node and bone marrow microenviroments play an important role in protecting CLL cells from apoptosis. Evidence exists to postulate that proliferating CLL cells in the lymph nodes are the source of the nonproliferating CLL cells present in the peripheral blood. However, most therapies used currently in CLLs do not target residual niches or leukemia cells that may depend heavily on the microenvironment. ',\n"," 'As such, relapse after chemotherapybased treatment is inevitable and this argues in favor of the development of novel treatment alternatives, including those that promote immune stimulation and activation of the tumor microenvironment. We have addressed this problem by studying in vitro and in vivo mechanism to promote cellular activation and immune recognition in CLL with an approach that involves transduction of CLL cells with vectors encoding the ligand for CD40 (CD154; ref.). Although the leukemia cells express high levels of human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) required for presentation of antigen to T cells, CLL cells are poor antigen-presenting cells. These cells lack expression of the immune costimulatory molecules required for effective T-cell activation and instead appear to suppress T-cell function. CD40 activation using recombinant antibodies or CD154 ligands have been used in patients with cancer and CLL showing objective clinical responses. Activation of B cells through CD40 changes its phenotype and induces immunoglobulin class switching and enhances its antigen-presenting capacity. Similar changes are also observed when CLL cells are activated via ligation of CD40, which can be achieved through transduction of CLL cells with an adenovirus (Ad) vector encoding CD154. Such transduced and CD40-activated CLL cells can induce autologous T-cell activation and immune recognition, leading to generation of anti-leukemia immune responses. We previously conducted clinical trials evaluating the safety and clinical activity of this approach. For these trials, patients underwent leukapheresis and CLL cells were subsequently transduced ex vivo with an Ad vector encoding either mouse-CD154 or a chimeric-humanized CD154, termed Ad-ISF35. Ad-ISF35 was developed to mitigate generation of immunity against mouse-CD154 and to improve membrane stability. Transduction of CLL cells with Ad-CD154 or Ad-ISF35 generated transduced CLL cells that had phenotypic features of CLL cells that had been activated by contact with CD154-bearing cells. Moreover, as these transduced CLL cells expressed a ligand for CD40, they also could activate bystander, nontransduced CLL cells to undergo such phenotypic changes. Clinical studies showed that i.v. infusions of autologous CLL cells that had been transduced with Ad-CD154 or Ad-ISF35 did not cause unacceptable or long-term toxicity, induced activation of \"bystander\" nontransduced CLL cells similar to that achieved by contact with CD154-/ISF35-bearing cells, almost invariably resulted in acute reductions in leukemia cell blood counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and could induce anti-leukemia immune responses. ',\n"," 'this approach, which also requires ex vivo processing of cells in specialized facilities that are not widely available. Therefore, we considered whether we could achieve similar biologic and clinical responses by injecting the Ad-ISF35 vector directly into pathologically enlarged lymph nodes of patients with CLL. This hypothesis is supported by preclinical studies in test animals showing that direct injection of Ad-ISF35 into tumor nodules is safe and capable of inducing antitumor responses. Thus, we conducted a first-in-man phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate toxicity, tolerability, and safety of Ad-ISF35 intranodal direct injection (IDI) in patients with CLL. Patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki to participate in this study. We enrolled and treated 15 patients who met the eligibility criteria, including diagnosis of CLL and progressive disease (PD) requiring treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL; refs.). All patients were offered standard chemoimmunotherapy but declined this treatment in favor of participating in this study. Patients presented at least one single accessible and palpable lymph node in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal regions. The size of the lymph nodes was larger than 2 x 2 cm in the horizontal and perpendicular axes. Additional inclusion criteria were hemoglobin >=10 g/dL, platelet count >=50 x 103/mm3 , total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine <=2x ULN (upper limit of normal), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <=2, and anticipated survival of at least 3 months. Patients were excluded from participating in this clinical trial if they had received treatment with chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies within 28 days before entering the study. Additional treatments for CLL were not allowed during the time of participation in this trial. In addition, patients with history of secondary malignancies within 5 years of registration were excluded from the protocol (except for patients with history of treated non-melanoma skin cancer). The study used a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 dose cohorts to receive one IDI of 1 x 1010, 3.3 x 1010, 1x1011, or 3.3 x 1011 viral particles (vp) of Ad-ISF35 (provided by Memgen, LLC). The injected node was in the axilla and greater than 2 x 2 cm in size before injection. The study design was reviewed and approved by the U.S. ',\n"," \"Food and Drug Administration (BB-IND 13046), the Recombinant Advisory Committee (RAC) of the NIH (Bethesda, MD), the University of California San Diego (UCSD, La Jolla, CA) Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and the UCSD Institutional Review Board. This clinical trial was registered in the NIH database (registration NCT00783874; ref.). We evaluated the patient's white blood cell counts (WBC), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), platelet counts (plt), hemoglobin (Hb), and size of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes before and at designated times after Ad-ISF35 IDI. The follow-up period included frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations on days 0,1, 2, 7,14, 21, 30, 60, and 84 after injection and every 3 months thereafter for a total of 1 year. Assessment of response to treatment was evaluated following the IWCLL guidelines. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any adverse event grade 3 or higher that was considered by the investigator to be possibly related or related to Ad-ISF35 treatment. DLTs were evaluated only during the first 21 days of treatment and their assessment determined dose escalation and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, modified for hematologic toxicities according to the IWCLL guidelines. Hematologic adverse events were considered DLT if they were grade 4 or higher and lasted 7 days or more. We defined the MTD as the highest dose where no more than one patient of 6 presented DLTs. Ten million of isolated WBCs/mL in PBS (+1% FBS) were incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs specific for CD5, CD19, CD54, CD80, CD86, CD20, DR5, CD3, CD4, CD8, mCD154 (used for detection of ISF35 protein expression), CD95, CD23 and kappa- or lambda-immunoglobulin light chain (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flow-Jo software (Tree Star Inc.). We examined serum samples for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TNF-alpha, granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IFN-gamma via Luminex xMAP technology following manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Luminex 100TM IS machine and BeadView Multiplex software v1.0 was used for data analysis by Spline curve-fitting method. We measured serum antibodies against Ad-ISF35 or recombinant human CD154 (rhCD154) protein by ELISA. \",\n"," \"Plates were coated with 4 x 109 vp/mL of Ad-ISF35 or 2 microg/mL of rhCD154 (R&D Systems) for 2 hours at 37 C. Plates were blocked with PBS/Tween 0.01%, bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1%. Sera samples collected on days 0 and 28 were added at different dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was added at 1:5,000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS-Tween 0.01%, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added, and reaction was stopped by adding 1N phosphoric acid. Optical densities were obtained in a SpectraMax250 plate reader (Molecular Devices). EC50 of each the serum was calculated with GraphPad Prism 4.0. Serial dilutions of serum samples were preincubated with 4 x 108 vp/mL of Ad-ISF35 for 10 minutes at 37 C. Then, the serum samples were added to 2 x 104 HeLa cells in 96-well plates for 24 hours at 37 C. HeLa cells were incubated with PBS-EDTA enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Gibco) for 10 minutes at 37 C and then incubated with 2 microL of antimouse CD154 and phycoerythrin-labeled (BD Pharmigen) for 30 minutes at 4 C. Fluorescence data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analysis was carried out using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Antibody neutralization activity was assessed by decrease in ISF35 (protein encoded by Ad-ISF35) expression in HeLa cells cultured with Ad-ISF35 preincubated with serum dilutions compared with the control cells incubated with Ad-IS35 without serum. Neutralizing activity was defined as at least 2-fold increase compared with pretreatment sample. We used a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that could detect 5 DNA copies or more of Ad-ISF35 in 100 ng of genomic DNA All the samples were tested in duplicate with a cycle threshold (Ct) variability that was less than 5% for Ad-ISF35 amplification. The following primers were used for Ad-ISF35 amplification (400 nmol/L): forward, 5'CCT CTG GCT GAA GCC CAG 3'; reverse, 5'CTC CCA AGT GAA TGG ATT GT 3'. MGB-FAM probe 5'TTACTCAAGGCGGCAAA3' was used at 250 nmol/L. The PCR reaction was carried out using TaqMan qPCR Universal Master Mix w/UNG from Applied Biosystems. The qPCR program used was 95 C for 3 minutes; 40 cycles: 95 C for 20 seconds, 52 C for 1 minute; and 20 seconds in Bio-Rad cycler iQ5 PCR machine. beta-Actin was used to monitor DNA quality. \",\n"," 'To calculate the Ad-ISF35 DNA copies present in given sample of DNA or cDNA, we used a standard curve with viral DNA ranging from 5 x 107 to 5 x 1010 viral copies. We used the IFN-gamma ELISPOT plates from R&D Systems, Inc. T cells from pre- and posttreatment (showing the highest number of CD8+ cells) from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated with Dynabeads against CD4 and CD8 (Invitrogen). CLL cells (5 x 106) from pretreatment samples (depleted of CD4 and CD8) were cultured for 24 hours with HeLa cells expressing CD154 (4 x 105) in 12-well plates. CLL cells were removed from cocultures and added into empty wells for 2 hours to allow floating HeLa-CD154 cells to reattach to the plate. CLL cells were washed and incubated with mitomycin C (60microg/mL) for 1 hour at 37 C. Activation of CLL cells was confirmed by flow cytometry measuring the upregulation of CD54 and CD95 markers. A total of 1 x 105 CLL nonactivated (CD4- and CD8-depleted) or CLL CD154-activated cells were cultured for 48 hours with 1x105 T cells plus L-2 (25 IU/mL). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic and baseline characteristics, clinical response variables, immunologic variables, and toxicity data. Univariate analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA with pre- and posttreatment values. HRs were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. All analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v4.0 and JMP v8.0. Five females and 10 males with a median age of 56 years (45-73 years) were enrolled in this study. The median leukemia cell doubling time for all patients was 3.3 months (0.9-22.5 months). The median number of prior treatments was 2 (0-7). Two patients were refractory to fludarabine-based treatment. CLL cells expressed unmutated Ig heavy chain variable region genes (IgVH) in 7 patients and ZAP-70 in 9 patients. Six patients had leukemia cells with adverse cytogenetics, 4 with deletions at 11q, and 2 with deletions at 17p (Table 1). All patients received Ad-ISF35 IDI. Only 2 of 15 patients did not complete the postinjection observation period of 84 days due to disease progression. The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions and systemic flu-like symptoms. Four patients had transient grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. One of these patients in cohort 2 presented grade 3 neutropenia that lasted for 6 days. ',\n"," 'This was not considered as DLT as the adverse event was not grade >= 4 and the duration was less than 7 days. In cohort 3, the first 3 patients did not present any DLTs. In cohort 4, 3 patients were enrolled, 2 of them presented DLTs including hypophosphatemia (grade 3 and 4) and AST elevation (grade 3). Because of this, we proceeded to enroll 3 additional patients in cohort 3 (3E). One patient presented with neutropenia grade 4 (not considered DLT as it lasted only 5 days) and one patient with hypophosphatemia grade 3 (considered DLT; Table 2). All adverse effects were subclinical and self-limiting. With these data, we defined cohort 3 dose (1 x 1011 vp) as the MTD. In addition, we have not observed long-term adverse effects associated with Ad-ISF35 IDI after a median follow-up of 2.5 years. We monitored the presence Ad-ISF35 DNA and ISF35 (protein encoded by Ad-ISF35 vector) expression in PBMCs collected before and after Ad-ISF35 IDI. For detection of Ad-ISF35 DNA, we used a sensitive qPCR assay capable of detecting 5 copies of Ad-ISF35 DNA in 100 ng of genomic DNA (gDNA). Ad-ISF35 was detected in only 3 patients 8 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI. Each of these patients had PBMCs with less than 9 copies of Ad-ISF35 per 100 ng of gDNA. Ad-ISF35 DNA was not detected at later time points (Fig. 1A). ISF35 protein surface expression was measured by flow cytometry. The results did not show detectable expression of ISF35 protein on the PBMCs of any patient at any time point (data not shown). Most patients (n = 14) experienced transient increases in platelet counts at day 7 and 14. None of the patients developed worsening anemia after injection (Fig. 1B). Also, we observed changes in T cells in the majority of patients enrolled in this study. During the first 48 hours, most patients (n = 11) had a transient fall in ALC (Fig. 1C) and absolute T-cell counts (Fig. 1D). The acute drop in T-cell counts was significant when compared with baseline levels in both cell subsets (CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ cells; P < 0.05). However, the majority of patients (n = 10) later showed an increase of T cells ranging from 6% to 311% during the first 4 weeks after Ad-ISF35 IDI. ',\n"," 'We observed that the majority of patients experienced an increase in ANC during the first 2 days following Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 1D). We observed systemic biologic responses to Ad-ISF35 IDI in most patients. In particular, we observed statistically significant upregulation of CD95, CD20, and HLAI during the first 48 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 1E). Such phenotypic changes are similar to those of CLL cells cocultured with CD154-bearing cells in vitro. We also noted that levels of IFN-g and IL-6 in the sera of 11 of 14 patients increased 1 day after Ad-ISF35 IDI relative to pretreatment levels. The relative increase in serum IFN-g appeared proportionate to the administered dose of Ad-ISF35 (linear trend analysis, P = 0.0328, r2 = 0.35); patients in cohorts 3 and 4 had the highest posttreatment serum levels of IFN-gamma (Fig. 2A). We evaluated whether cytokines or other factors present in the serum of patients who received Ad-ISF35 IDI were responsible for the phenotypic changes observed in circulating leukemic cells. CLL cells were cultured with autologous serum samples collected before and 1 day after Ad-ISF35 IDI. As a control, the same CLL cells were stimulated by coculture with CD154-bearing cells (HeLa-CD154). The expression levels of surface immune costimulatory molecules and death receptors were evaluated via flow cytometry. CLL cells cultured with sera collected before or after Ad-ISF35 IDI did not induce increased expression of these surface antigens. In contrast, CLL cells cocultured with HeLa-CD154 expressed higher levels of CD95 or immune costimulatory molecules than CLL cells cocultured with wild-type HeLa (Fig. 2B). Samples collected before and after Ad-ISF35 IDI from 4 patients were evaluated by ELISPOT assay to detect IFN-gamma production from T cells in response to coculture with CD40-stimulated autologous CLL cells. In these patients, we did not observe significant increase in the levels of T-cell/IFN-gamma production after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Supplementary Fig. S1). We evaluated for antibodies specific for adenovirus or human CD154 (hCD154). Sera collected from patients before Ad-ISF35 IDI had median titer of anti-adenovirus antibodies of 352 [confidence interval (CI), 173-531]. However, sera collected 1 month after therapy had significantly higher titers (median, 622; CI, 151-1,093; P < 0.05). Except for patient #10, the antiadenovirus antibodies induced by Ad-ISF35 IDI did not neutralize the capacity of adenovirus to infect HeLa cells in vitro (Table 3). None of the patients developed detectable antibodies to human CD154. ',\n"," 'Although Ad-ISF35 IDI was injected into a single axillary lymph node, we observed systemic clinical responses. The magnitude of these responses did not appear to have a clear dose-response relationship. Considering the best response during 84 days after Ad-ISF35 IDI, 87%, 80%, and 53% of patients had respective reductions in lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or ALC by more than 50% (Fig. 3A). The response observed in spleen and lymph nodes was durable during the course of the study (Fig. 3B). Three patients achieved partial response (PR), 7 patients had stable disease (SD), and 5 had PD by IWCLL criteria (refs.; Table 1). Six patients (patients 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, and 15) had durable responses (median, 8.8 months) and did not require additional treatment for over 6 months. Two of these patients (patients 2 and 5) did not require additional treatment for over a year after Ad-ISF35 IDI. The median time to next treatment (TNTx) for all patients was 5 months. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine hazard ratios (HR) comparing the duration of response (>=6 months), with variables such as number of prior therapies (<=1), ZAP-70 (<=20% positive cells), B2M levels (<=2.5 mg/L), IgG levels (<=500 mg/dL), splenomegaly (<=5 cm), and bidimensional lymph node product (total <=70 cm2). This analysis showed that only the number of prior therapies (<=1) had a statistically significant correlation with the duration of response (HR, 0.1491; CI, 0.04071-0.5464; P = 0.0041; Table 4). Therefore, patients who had no more than one prior treatment for CLL were 6.7 times more likely to have a durable response (TNTx >= 6 months). We examined the safety of gene immunotherapy using Ad-ISF35 IDI in patients with CLL. The injection of Ad-ISF35 into an axillary lymph node was safely delivered and without long-term adverse effects. Most of adverse effects were anticipated and of low-grade (grade 1 or 2). These included flu-like symptoms and erythema or pain at the site of injection. Such adverse effects have been observed in patients injected with adenovirus vectors directly into tumor nodules and most likely represent an inflammatory response to adenovirus infection/transduction. Many of the adverse events noted in this study also were similar to those observed in patients infused with autologous CLL cells transduced ex vivo with Ad-mCD154 or Ad-ISF35. ',\n"," 'In these ex vivo studies, patients who received the highest dose of transduced cells generally had a higher incidence of grade 2 versus grade 1 adverse events. We observed a similar dose relationship in patients receiving the 2 higher doses of Ad-ISF35, suggesting that there might be a relationship between the injected dose of Ad-ISF35 and frequency or intensity of adverse events. We observed grade 3/4 neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and AST elevation in 6 patients treated in cohorts 2, 3E, and 4. In 3 of these patients (n = 2 in cohort 4 and n = 1 in cohort 3E), hypophosphatemia and AST elevation were considered DLTs and thus defined the MTD as 1 x 1011 vp (cohort 3 dose). All the adverse events observed were subclinical and transient. The grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia observed could be related to increased serum levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 during the first 24 hours following Ad-ISF35 IDI. Hypophosphatemia has been associated with high serum levels of such inflammatory cytokines in patients with sepsis and in mice injected with IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-1beta. Some patients in the cohorts that received the higher doses also experienced transient elevations in serum hepatic transaminases. Although such transient and asymptomatic elevation of transaminases has been observed in patients who received i.v. injections of adenovirus vectors, the patient who had grade 3 elevation in AST elevation did not have detectable Ad-ISF35 in the blood. As such, it is conceivable that the transient elevations in hepatic transaminases instead could be associated with high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines could have been secreted in response to adenovirus infection as well as in response to CD40-CD154 stimulation. Several patients had decreased ALC and elevated ANC during the first 48 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI, only to develop neutropenia 2 to 3 weeks later. Early increases in blood neutrophils associated with decreases in blood lymphocytes have been observed in mice infused with syngeneic dendritic cells stimulated by CD154 and IL-2 and pulsed with lymphoma antigens. Changes in ANC could be a direct response to modulation of the CD40-CD154 pathway as it has been observed in our mouse model and in patients with CD154 deficiency and hyper-IgM syndrome. On the other hand, neutropenia could be secondary to elevated levels of IFN-gamma and/or IL-6. Nevertheless, each patient recovered with no evidence of infection or other related complications. ',\n"," 'We observed fluctuation in T-cell counts after Ad-ISF35 IDI. Initially, during the first 48 hours after injection, the T cells decreased significantly and this could be in response to viral infection, cytokines, cell migration, or activation-induced cell death. At later time points, the majority of patients showed increase in T cells up to 300%, which was similar to what we have observed in previous studies using Ad-CD154. We studied whether T cells isolated after therapy were reactive against autologous CLL cells using ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma. However, in 4 patients available for evaluation, we did not observe reactivity of T cells against CD40-stimulated CLL cells. This finding is different than our previous experience in patients receiving ex vivo transduced autologous CLL cells with Ad-CD154. It is unclear the reasons for the lack of evidence of T-cell stimulation in response to AD-ISF35 IDI measured by IFN-gamma ELISPOT. Potential explanations could be the different route of administration (ex vivo vs. IDI), sample size, and time of analysis of the samples. Other immunemediated processes including microenvironment cell activation of macrophages could be responsible for the objective responses observed in some patients in this study. It is conceivable to hypothesize that multiple intranodal injections could enhance immunologic responses including T-cell reactivity against CLL antigens. We will address these mechanistic questions in future studies. We did not find evidence for Ad-ISF35 DNA in the PBMCs except in 3 patients, who had trace levels of detectable Ad-ISF35 DNA (close to the low-limit of sensitivity) 8 hours after injection. In addition, we did not detect expression of ISF35 protein on circulating CLL cells at any time following Ad-ISF35 IDI. Nevertheless, all patients experienced a systemic biologic response. We observed phenotypic changes in the circulating CLL cells that included expression of immune costimulatory molecules and death receptors. These changes were similar to those observed in vitro after leukemia cells are cultured with CD154-expressing cells. It is unlikely that the clinical and biologic activity observed after Ad-ISF35 IDI are mediated by direct transduction of cells distant from the injected lymph node. Our data in an A20 lymphoma mouse model have shown that after intratumoral injections, Ad-ISF35 is primarily found in tumor tissues with no evidence of accumulation or persistence in peripheral organs with a rapid virus clearance 24 hours after injection. ',\n"," 'In the same mouse model, we have detected the transduction not only in lymphoma cells but also in other important cells from the microenvironment such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells (manuscript in preparation). This suggests the possibility that phenotypic changes of microenvironment of cells may play a role in response to intratumoral Ad-ISF35 injection. Similarly, our data suggest that serum cytokines or other soluble factors are not entirely responsible for the phenotypic changes observed after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the presence of systemic objective clinical response observed in conjunction with phenotypic changes and the lack of detectable Ad-ISF35 in circulating leukemia cells suggest that these effects are due to the stimulation generated by either contact with ISF35-bearing cells or other nontransduced activated cells, providing the so-called bystander-effect. Lymph node biopsies before and after Ad-ISF35 injection could have provided additional insight into this process. However, they were not conducted in this study to avoid additional local toxicities and adverse events that could interfere with the primary endpoint of this phase I study, which was to evaluate safety and tolerability. We are planning to conduct these biopsies in subsequent clinical trials. One concern was whether Ad-ISF35 IDI would induce autoantibodies reactive with hCD154. Such autoantibodies conceivably could induce adverse effects that are similar to those noted for some patients treated with antibodies specific for CD154. However, none of the patients developed antibodies reactive with hCD154. Nevertheless, 40% of treated patients were induced to increase their titers of antibodies of anti-adenovirus, indicating that Ad-ISF35 IDI could elicit an anti-adenovirus antibody response even in patients who have immune deficiency associated with CLL. Moreover, patients with CLL typically have hypogammaglobulinemia (median serum IgG levels in this study was 496 mg/dL) and typically respond poorly to administered vaccines. One of the treated patient also developed antibodies to adenovirus that could neutralize Ad-ISF35. It is uncertain whether the development of such antibodies can mitigate the activity of subsequent injections of Ad-ISF35. This will be evaluated in subsequent clinical studies examining the safety and activity of repeated administrations of Ad-ISF35 IDI. Although the primary purpose of the current study was to examine the safety of Ad-ISF35 IDI, we observed objective clinical responses in the majority of the patients treated. Patients experienced a 50% or more reduction in leukemia cell counts (7 of 15), lymphadenopathy (13 of 15), or splenomegaly (12 of 15). ',\n"," 'Six patients did not require additional treatment for 6 months or more and 3 patients achieved a PR. Moreover, responses achieved in the spleen and lymph nodes were durable and the majority of patients requiring additional treatment did so because of persistent lymphocytosis. This suggests that Ad-ISF35 can promote changes in the microenvironment of lymph nodes and spleen that could translate into a clinical benefit. Further studies to corroborate these observations are needed. Clinical responses in CLL can be compartmentalized. Patients can have excellent reduction of lymphocytosis but no response in large lymph nodes like in the case of patients treated with alemtuzumab, or good reduction in lymphadenopathy and spleen, but lack of response or lymphocytosis progression like in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the patients reported in this phase I study, we observed better and more durable responses in reduction of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Despite the fact that most patients had some degree of response (Fig. 3), only 3 of them fulfill all the criteria needed to achieve a clinical response based on the international guidelines. Previously untreated patients or those with less than one previous treatment showed the best clinical responses to Ad-ISF35 IDI (almost 7 times more likely to have durable responses). This supports the notion that early immunologic intervention in patients with CLL could result in better clinical outcomes. Although whether prior treatment with drugs or agents that suppress immune function mitigates the activity of Ad-ISF35 IDI needs to be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials. In summary, this first-in-man phase I clinical study shows that gene immunotherapy using Ad-ISF35 IDI is feasible and safe. We defined the dose of 1 x 1011 vp per injection as the MTD. Even though the study was designed to determine safety and tolerability of a single Ad-ISF35 IDI, we also observed systemic biologic and clinical effects. This is despite the fact that we could not detect expression of ISF35 protein in mononuclear cells isolated from the blood of patients following Ad-ISF35 IDI. This suggests that such responses were due to a bystander-effect in which leukemia cells are induced to undergo phenotypic changes when in contact with ISF35-bearing cells or other nontransduced activated cells. ',\n"," 'Our results also indicate that Ad-ISF-35 IDI-induced antibody, cytokine responses, and changes in the phenotype of circulating CLL cells that are consistent with immune activation similar to that induced by i.v. administration of autologous Ad-ISF35-transduced CLL cells. This suggests a greater interchange of cells between the blood, spleen, and lymphoid compartments of patients with CLL. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study conducted in patients with CLL showing that direct intratumoral/intranodal modulation by an immune-based strategy can result in clinical activity. This argues that the tumor microenvironment is a relevant target in this disease. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P = 0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.) Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a variable natural history that is partly predicted by clinical and genomic features. Therapy for CLL has evolved from monotherapy with alkylating agents to chemoimmunotherapy. Each of the combination regimens has shown prolonged rates of progression- free survival, as compared with similar regimens that do not contain antibodies. Treatment of patients with relapsed CLL often includes regimens such as bendamustine and rituximab, ofatumumab, or investigational agents. \",\n"," \"Ofatumumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency on the basis of a single-group study involving patients who had resistance to fludarabine and alemtuzumab therapy; with an overall response rate of 58%, ofatumumab has been recommended in international consensus guidelines as a therapeutic option for patients with previously treated CLL. A short duration of response to initial therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities have been associated with a poor outcome among patients receiving conventional therapy. Identifying new therapies that prolong survival remains an important need for these patients. Ibrutinib (Imbruvica, Pharmacyclics and Janssen) is a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, an essential enzyme in B-cell receptor signaling, homing, and adhesion. On the basis of response rates in single-group, phase 2 studies, ibrutinib was recognized by the FDA as a breakthrough therapy and was granted accelerated approval for patients with mantle-cell lymphoma (in November 2013) and CLL (in February 2014) who had received at least one previous therapy. Among patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), those who received ibrutinib had a response rate of 71%, according to investigator assessment, and a progression-free survival rate of 75% at 2 years. In this study, drug toxicity did not result in the discontinuation of ibrutinib in most patients. On the basis of early results of the phase 2 trial, we initiated a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, the Study of Ibrutinib versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE), to compare once-daily oral ibrutinib with an active control single-agent therapy, ofatumumab, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL. Patients with CLL or SLL requiring therapy were eligible for enrollment if they had received at least one previous therapy and were considered to be inappropriate candidates for purine analogue treatment because they had a short progression-free interval after chemoimmunotherapy or because they had coexisting illnesses, an age of 70 years or more, or a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion (Text S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). \",\n"," 'an absolute neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per microliter, a platelet count of at least 30,000 cells per microliter, and adequate liver and kidney function. Patients requiring warfarin or strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors were excluded. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics and Janssen. All the authors and their research teams collected the data. Representatives of Pharmacyclics designed the study, confirmed the accuracy of the data, and compiled the data for analysis; Janssen representatives had no active role in the study. The authors had full access to the data and analyses for the compilation of this report. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript, which was reviewed, modified, and approved in its final version by all the authors. Editorial assistance was provided by two professional medical editors funded by Pharmacyclics. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org) and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. An independent review committee, whose members were unaware of study-group assignments and lymphocyte counts, assessed progression and response. An independent data and safety monitoring committee evaluated safety and reviewed data from the protocol-specified interim analysis. From June 2012 through April 2013, we enrolled 391 patients at 67 sites in the United States, Australia, and seven European countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral ibrutinib (at a dose of 420 mg once daily) until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects or intravenous ofatumumab for up to 24 weeks at an initial dose of 300 mg at week 1, followed by a dose of 2000 mg weekly for 7 weeks and then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, consistent with local labeling. Patients were stratified according to whether they had resistance to purine analogue chemoimmunotherapy (defined as no response or a relapse within 12 months after the last dose of a purine analogue) and whether they had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. ',\n"," 'During this study, promising data from the phase 2 trial led investigators to request, and the steering committee to recommend, crossover of patients in the ofatumumab group to the ibrutinib group. This revision was supported by the data and safety monitoring committee and was discussed with health authorities. Approximately 4 months after the last patient underwent randomization, a protocol amendment allowed patients in the ofatumumab group who had disease progression, as confirmed by an independent review committee, to receive ibrutinib. The primary end point was the duration of progression- free survival, as assessed by the independent review committee, according to the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. (Details regarding criteria for a complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.) On the basis of a clarification adopted in 2012, treatment-related lymphocytosis was not considered to be progressive disease. Key secondary end points included the duration of overall survival and the response rate. The criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia require the use of computed tomography (CT) to evaluate response and persistent improvement for at least 2 months to confirm response. Patients were monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks, every 4 weeks until month 6, and then every 12 weeks, with full response assessments performed every 12 weeks. Toxicity was graded according to the criteria of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0; the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia were used to evaluate hematologic toxicity. Reports of eye-related adverse events were collected proactively on the basis of preclinical toxicology studies in dogs that revealed corneal abnormalities in animals receiving ibrutinib at a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (equivalent dose in humans, 81 mg per kilogram per day). Pathologists at a central laboratory assessed the results of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate cytogenetic factors (a procedure that was also performed at local site laboratories), measurements of serum beta2-microglobulin, and mutational analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes. (The presence of unmutated genes is usually associated with a poorer response to therapy and a worse outcome.) The primary end point, progression-free survival, was used in the calculation of the study sample size. ',\n"," \"The number of required events was based on a target hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.60, as calculated with the use of a two-sided log-rank test at an alpha level of 0.05, with a study power of at least 90%. The efficacy boundary (two-sided P<0.028) was crossed at the preplanned interim analysis, and the results from that analysis are presented in this report. The primary analysis was a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to the presence or absence of the chromosome 17p13.1 deletion and the disease refractory status at randomization. The type I error was controlled through adjustment of the significance level with the use of the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for the interim analysis and with the use of a hierarchical closed-testing procedure for primary and ordered secondary end points. The baseline characteristics of the patients were generally well balanced between the two study groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The majority of patients had advanced- stage disease. Patients in the ibrutinib group had undergone a median of three previous therapies, and those in the ofatumumab group had undergone a median of two previous therapies. The majority of patients had received previous treatment with purine analogues, alkylating agents, and anti-CD20 antibodies, which were frequently administered in combination. The percentage of patients with bulky disease (>=5 cm) was higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (64% vs. 52%). Approximately 57% of the patients in the two study groups had a deletion at either chromosome 17p13.1 or chromosome 11q22.3. The median follow-up time was 9.4 months (range, 0.1 to 16.6), and 86% of patients were still receiving ibrutinib at the time of this analysis (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged the duration of progression-free survival, with the median not reached at a median follow-up of 9.4 months, as compared with a median duration of progression-free survival of 8.1 months with ofatumumab. The hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group was 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.32; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). This represents a 78% reduction in the risk of progression or death among patients treated with ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab. At 6 months, 88% of patients in the ibrutinib group were still alive with no disease progression, as compared with 65% in the ofatumumab group. \",\n"," \"The effect of ibrutinib on progression-free survival was observed regardless of baseline clinical characteristics or molecular features (Fig. 2). Among patients with a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, the median duration of progression-free survival was not reached in the ibrutinib group, as compared with a median of 5.8 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.45). At 6 months, 83% of the patients with this deletion in the ibrutinib group, as compared with 49% of those with this deletion in the ofatumumab group, were alive with no disease progression. Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into an aggressive, rapidly growing large-cell lymphoma) was confirmed in two patients in each study group. Prolymphocytic leukemia developed in an additional patient in the ibrutinib group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly prolonged the rate of overall survival (hazard ratio for death in the ibrutinib group, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.79; P = 0.005), with the risk of death reduced by 57% (Fig. 1B). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. At the time of this analysis, 57 patients in the ofatumumab group had crossed over to receive ibrutinib after confirmed disease progression. The survival effect was based on an analysis in which data were censored at the time of crossover. At 12 months, the survival effect was also observed in the uncensored sensitivity analysis (hazard ratio for death, 0.39; P = 0.001), with an overall survival rate of 90% in the ibrutinib group and 79% in the ofatumumab group (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The difference in overall survival supporting the superiority of ibrutinib was preserved in all the subgroups defined according to pretreatment and genetic features (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The independently assessed response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (Fig. 3A). Overall, 43% of the patients in the ibrutinib group had a partial response, as compared with 4% in the ofatumumab group (odds ratio, 17.4; 95% CI, 8.1 to 37.3; P<0.001). In addition, 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib had a partial response with lymphocytosis (resulting in a 63% response rate). Lymphocytosis was observed in 69% of the patients who were treated with ibrutinib and was not considered to be disease progression. \",\n"," 'The condition resolved in 77% of these patients during follow-up. In a recent study, patients with a partial response with lymphocytosis had rates of progression-free survival that were similar to those in patients with a partial response. Investigator- assessed response rates were higher than independently assessed response rates in the two study groups (Fig. 3B). Treatment exposure was longer among patients receiving ibrutinib than among those receiving ofatumumab (median duration, 8.6 months [range, 0.2 to 16.1] vs. 5.3 months [range, 0 to 7.4]). The profiles of cumulative adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of the patients are presented without adjustment for duration of exposure in Table 2. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events that occurred in at least 20% of the patients were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Overall, 57% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and 47% of the patients in the ofatumumab group had at least one adverse event of grade 3 or higher. Serious adverse events are summarized in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred more frequently in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group included diarrhea (4% vs. 2%) and atrial fibrillation (3% vs. 0%); the latter event required cessation of therapy in one patient. An additional four patients in the ibrutinib group and one patient in the ofatumumab group had grade 1 or 2 atrial fibrillation. Bleeding-related adverse events of any grade (most commonly, petechiae, and including ecchymoses) were more common in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (44% vs. 12%). Major hemorrhage (any hemorrhagic event of grade 3 or higher or resulting in transfusion of red cells or in hospitalization) was reported in two patients (1%) in the ibrutinib group (including one patient with a subdural hematoma) and three patients (2%) in the ofatumumab group. Other adverse events that were more commonly noted among patients receiving ibrutinib than among those receiving ofatumumab included rash (8% vs. 4%), pyrexia (24% vs. 15%), and blurred vision (10% vs. 3%); all these events were generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. The incidence of cataracts was 3% and 1%, respectively. ',\n"," 'Infections of any grade were more common in the ibrutinib group (70% vs. 54%), whereas the frequency of infections of grade 3 or higher was similar in the two study groups (24% vs. 22%) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Infusion reactions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, urticaria, night sweats, and pruritus were more common in the ofatumumab group. Basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas were reported in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 2% in the ofatumumab group; nonskin cancers were seen in 3% and 1% of the patients, respectively. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events occurred in 4% of the patients in each study group. Fatal events occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 5% of those in the ofatumumab group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). These events were most commonly infectious in nature. Adverse events resulting in dose reductions occurred in 4% of the patients treated with ibrutinib, with only diarrhea (which occurred in three patients) leading to a dose reduction in more than one patient. Changes in creatinine levels from baseline were similar in the two study groups, with a decrease in creatinine clearance of any grade observed in 16% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 17% of those in the ofatumumab group. Among patients with relapsed CLL or SLL, including those who had a short duration of response to prior therapy or who had adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, ibrutinib was superior to ofatumumab with respect to progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate at a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The positive effect of ibrutinib was observed in subgroups of patients with a high-risk chromosome 17p13.1 deletion and with resistance to previous purine analogue therapy. Similar benefits with respect to progression-free survival were observed regardless of age, clinical stage, and factors such as status with respect to mutations in IGHV. The effect of ibrutinib on overall survival was significant, an effect that was robust despite the crossover of 57 patients to the ibrutinib group after they had disease progression while receiving ofatumumab; this effect was also observed in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Except for a few differences, our findings are largely similar to those of other trials of ibrutinib or ofatumumab. ',\n"," 'In each of the two groups in our study, the response rate as determined by independent assessors was lower than the response rate as determined by investigators. In the phase 2 study of ibrutinib monotherapy, in which response was assessed by investigators, the response rate was 71%, which is similar to the 70% response rate assessed by investigators in our study. The independently assessed response rate in the ofatumumab group in our study appears to be lower than that in the pivotal study that was based on 1996 National Cancer Institute guidelines for CLL, which did not require CT scanning to confirm response. This difference may be due in part to the requirement in our study for serial CT scanning, which was performed every 12 weeks, to confirm response. Another ofatumumab study that compared response assessment between patients who underwent CT scanning and those who did not undergo CT scanning showed substantial differences in the rates of response between the two subgroups, with lower response rates seen in the group that underwent CT scanning. Furthermore, the investigator-assessed response rate among patients in the ofatumumab group in our study (21%) was similar to the rate (23%) in a recent study that used 2008 criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Reassuringly, the results with respect to progression-free survival in the ofatumumab group in our study (median, 8.1 months) are similar to those in historical reports (median, approximately 6 months). Previous reports of ofatumumab therapy showed that patients with refractory CLL had a median survival of 12 months and 15 months, with no plateau in deaths. With a median follow- up of 9.4 months in our study, an early separation in the curves for overall survival favored ibrutinib; however, the median was not reached in either study group. At later time points, the survival curve for ofatumumab began to flatten, which may in part be a reflection of the influence of ibrutinib on patients in the ofatumumab group who crossed over to ibrutinib therapy. Ibrutinib was associated with toxic effects that were expected on the basis of the results of phase 2 studies. It appears that the drug can be safely administered even in a heavily pretreated and elderly population with baseline coexisting conditions, such as the one in our study. ',\n"," 'In the ibrutinib group, 32% of the patients had a decreased creatinine clearance, 64% had cytopenias, and 32% had a score on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale of more than 6 (ranging from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating worse health status). Toxic effects did not result in frequent dose reductions or treatment discontinuations. One strength of a randomized, controlled trial is that background disease-related complications may be differentiated from a treatment effect with a new agent. However, it is important to note that patients in the ibrutinib group had a reporting period for adverse events that was more than 3 months longer than that in the ofatumumab group (median duration, 8.6 months vs. 5.3 months), and no exposure-adjusted analysis of adverse events was performed. The frequencies of renal complications and increased creatinine levels were similar in the two study groups. Although the overall rate of infections was higher in the ibrutinib group, the frequency of infections of grade 3 or higher did not differ significantly between the two groups. Ocular symptoms were collected proactively and were reported more frequently among patients in the ibrutinib group, including a small proportion of patients who reported blurred vision. The development of cataracts in 3% of the patients receiving ibrutinib (as compared with 1% in the control group) bears noting, since longer exposure may be associated with an increased risk. Atrial fibrillation of any grade was noted in 10 patients in the ibrutinib group, as compared with 1 patient in the ofatumumab group, and led to the discontinuation of ibrutinib in 1 patient. Potential reasons for the higher rate of atrial fibrillation among patients receiving ibrutinib are being explored. In clinical studies in which serial electrocardiographic studies were performed, no evidence of arrhythmias was observed among patients receiving ibrutinib. An adverse event of interest with ibrutinib from early studies was major hemorrhage, including subdural hematoma. In our study, we excluded patients requiring warfarin but not those requiring other forms of anticoagulation. The rate of major hemorrhage was similar in the two study groups, with one subdural hematoma noted in a patient receiving ibrutinib. Although mild bleeding episodes were more common in the ibrutinib group, adherence to appropriate drug-withholding guidelines perioperatively and precautions regarding the use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants resulted in no unexpected major bleeding complications in the ibrutinib group. ',\n"," \"Further studies of the mechanism of bleeding, including bruising, that was observed among patients receiving ibrutinib have been conducted or are planned. In conclusion, ibrutinib was superior to ofatumumab in difficult-to-treat patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, as measured by progression-free survival, overall survival, and response. The improvement was observed across all subgroups that were examined, including patients who were resistant to chemoimmunotherapy and those with a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, which confirms single-agent ibrutinib as an effective therapy for CLL or SLL. Phase 3 studies examining the effect of ibrutinib in previously untreated patients with CLL or SLL are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02048813 and NCT01722487).

',\n"," 'Ibrutinib and other targeted inhibitors of B-cell receptor signaling achieve impressive clinical results for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A treatment-induced rise in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has emerged as a class effect of kinase inhibitors in CLL and warrants further investigation. We here report correlative studies in 64 patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. We quantified tumor burden in blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, assessed phenotypic changes of circulating cells, and measured whole blood viscosity. With just one dose of ibrutinib the average increase in ALC was 66%, and in over 40% of patients the ALC peaked within 24 hours of initiating treatment. Circulating CLL cells on day 2 showed increased Ki67 and CD38 expression, indicating an efflux of tumor cells from the tissue compartments into the blood. The kinetics and degree of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable; interestingly in patients with a high baseline ALC the relative increase was mild and resolution rapid. After two cycles of treatment the disease burden in lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen decreased irrespective of the relative change in ALC. Whole blood viscosity was dependent on both ALC and hemoglobin. No adverse events were attributed to the lymphocytosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a malignancy of mature B-cells that involves blood, bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, is the most common leukemia in western countries. In the US alone ~120 000 people live with CLL, while an estimated 15 680 people will be newly diagnosed with, and 4 580 will die of CLL in 2013. Median survival with early stage disease is 10.7 years; however, the clinical course is quite heterogeneous, depending on prognostic markers like Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Variable (IGHV) gene mutation status, ZAP70 expression, deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) or presence of SF3B1 and NOTCH1 mutations. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has emerged as a key pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL. A role for antigenic stimulation of the clonal cells was first indicated by the observation that CLL cells use a restricted repertoire of IGHV genes that encode the antigen interacting interface of the BCR. More recently, the discovery of BCR stereotypes shared by a substantial proportion of CLL cases, suggests that CLL cells may arise from B-cells with defined antigen specificities. BCR signaling and activation of the NF-kappaB pathway occur primarily in the lymph node microenvironment promoting cell growth, proliferation, and survival. ',\n"," \"Thus, antigenic stimulation emerges as a driving pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL; a mechanism that is also implicated in an increasing number of mature B-cell malignancies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is recruited early in the BCR signaling cascade in conjunction with SYK and PI3Kdelta. BTK couples BCR activation to intracellular calcium release and activation of NF-kappaB and is essential for normal B-cell development and response of B-cells to antigenic stimulation. Knockdown of BTK is lethal to select lymphoma cell lines derived from activated B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and decreases the viability of primary CLL cells. In addition, genetic ablation of BTK inhibits disease progression in mouse models of CLL. Ibrutinib, an orally active agent, covalently binds to Cys-481 of BTK thereby irreversibly inactivating the kinase. In the phase I study, ibrutinib was well tolerated and active across a spectrum of mature B-cell malignancies, with the highest response rates in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). More recently, overall response rates of >70%, and an estimated 26 month progression free survival rate of 75% for previously treated patients with CLL was reported. In vitro ibrutinib has been shown to inhibit proliferation, adhesion and migration of CLL cells. Further, murine CLL models suggest that ibrutinib inhibits homing of CLL cells to tissue sites. In addition to ibrutinib, several other inhibitors of kinases in the BCR pathway are in clinical development. Initial clinical experience with such BCR inhibitors raised concerns due to a sometimes dramatic worsening of peripheral lymphocytosis, which is now recognized as a class effect. Concerns about patient safety due to the treatment-induced lymphocytosis have been somewhat alleviated by the increasing experience with these agents in clinical trials. However, many questions remain. Here we focused on the kinetics and inter-individual variability in treatment-induced lymphocytosis, characterized changes in the immune-phenotype of circulating CLL cells on treatment, assessed concomitant changes in disease distribution in different anatomic compartments, and sequentially determined whole blood viscosity during the period of peak lymphocytosis. We found that the ibrutinib induced lymphocytosis developed almost immediately after the first dose of drug, peaked within 24 hours in many patients, and showed pronounced inter-patient variability. We provide direct in vivo evidence that the initial rise in lymphocytosis is in large part due to the release of previously activated cells from the lymph node. \",\n"," 'drug, peaked within 24 hours in many patients, and showed pronounced inter-patient variability. We provide direct in vivo evidence that the initial rise in lymphocytosis is in large part due to the release of previously activated cells from the lymph node. Furthermore, substantial reductions in tumor burden in lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen independent of changes in the number of circulating CLL cells underscores the notion that in CLL patients treated with BCR inhibitors, the ALC is not a valid surrogate of overall disease burden or activity. We report correlative analyses on 64 CLL patients enrolled between January 2012 and October 2013 in our ongoing, investigator-initiated phase II study of ibrutinib (NCT01500733). The study was approved by the local ethics committee; informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory patients with either del(17p) or age >=65 years were eligible (Table 1) and treated with ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of intolerable side effects. Mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene was assessed as described and CLL with <2% mutations was classified as unmutated. Complete blood counts were determined in the NIH central laboratory. Groups of patients having distinct patterns of treatment-induced lymphocytosis (in regards to degree of change in ALC, and the kinetics of onset and resolution) were identified using hierarchical clustering (Eisen Laboratory, Stanford University, CA). Whole blood viscosity was determined by quantitative viscometry of whole blood (ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE v 4.03. Tumor volume in spleen and lymph node was computed from CT scans using syngovia software (Siemens, Cary, NC). Of the spleen volume, 70% was considered due to CLL cells. Bone marrow volume was calculated as previously published, and the content of CLL cells was calculated from the overall marrow cellularity multiplied by the degree of CLL cell infiltration. Cellular density was estimated at 109 cells/ml based on measurements of thymocyte density. Peripheral blood volume was calculated using the Nadler formula. The number of CLL cells was calculated based on measured ALC and the percentage of CD19+ cells among all lymphocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared by density-gradient centrifugation (Lymphocyte Separation Media; ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Lymph node derived single cell suspensions were obtained from core biopsies. ',\n"," \"Cell suspensions were stained as previously described (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For Ki67 staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 70% EtOH. To assess cell death fresh whole blood samples were collected, red cells were removed by ACK lysis, and CLL cell viability was assessed with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Cells were analyzed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACS-DIVA 6.1.1 and FlowJo software (Version 8.8.6; TreeStar, Ashland, OR). When comparing patient groups, a linear model was applied (JMP10 software, SAS Inc, Cary, NC). When comparing specific events among patient groups a Fisher's exact test was used. All other statistical analyses were by Student's T-test (Prism5, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). To test the hypothesis that the treatment-related increase in ALC is due to efflux of CLL cells from the lymph node, the predicted percentage of CLL cells expressing Ki67 (Ki67T PB) on day 2 was calculated from the change in ALC and the measured percentage of CLL cells expressing Ki67 pre-treatment in peripheral blood (KI67 PB pre) and lymph node (Ki67 LN pre):  Within 24 hours of initiating ibrutinib the mean baseline ALC of 105 000/muL increased on average by 66% (P<0.001) and continued to increase throughout the first cycle before it gradually declined (Figure 1a and b). Within four hours of starting treatment the mean ALC had already increased in most patients (data not shown). Thus, the onset of ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis was virtually immediate and in many patients reached its peak within days; in 46% of patients on day 2 and in 78% by day 28 (Figure 1c). The magnitude of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable between patients (Figure 1d), without any correlation to prior treatment history or the presence of absence of del(17p) (Supplementary Figure S1a-d). However, patients with IGHV mutated CLL showed a more pronounced rise in ALC that resolved more slowly than in patients with IGHV unmutated CLL (P<0.001; Supplementary Figure S1e-f). To test for factors that might predict distinct patterns of lymphocytosis, we used an unsupervised clustering analysis of the relative change in ALC over the first 6 months on treatment compared to baseline. Three separate clusters of patients that differ in the degree and the kinetics of the lymphocytosis were identified (Figure 2a-c). \",\n"," \"Notably, the pre-treatment ALC was significantly different between the three clusters (P<0.002, Figure 2d). The mean pre-treatment ALC was highest for patients in cluster 1 and in this group of patients the treatment-induced lymphocytosis peaked within days and resolved rapidly. Conversely, patients in cluster 3 tended to have lower pre-treatment ALC and showed a greater relative increase in lymphocytosis that developed and resolved more slowly. Compared to the other clusters, cluster 3 was enriched for patients having IGHV mutated CLL and bulky lymphadenopathy (at least one node with largest diameter >5 cm; Table 2). Conversely, patients in cluster 1 frequently had advanced Rai stage (80%). Thus, it appears that CLL patients with moderate lymphadenopathy may have a shorter time to peak ALC and a faster resolution of lymphocytosis, while bulky disease was here associated with more prolonged lymphocytosis. Notably, there was no significant difference in the degree of nodal response at 6 months among the three clusters (Table 2), suggesting that a prolonged lymphocytosis does not predict for inferior response; in agreement with a recent report by Woyach et al. We estimated a patient's total disease burden from the ALC, the extent of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly on CT scans, and the degree of bone marrow infiltration. Figure 3 summarizes data for four representative patients. The distribution of disease among the different anatomic compartments varied greatly between individual patients (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 1). During treatment, we repeatedly assessed the tumor burden in these sites for four patients chosen to represent cases with both diverse involvement of the four compartments pre-treatment and different kinetics of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis. The aggregate volume of lymphadenopathy as calculated from CT scans is shown for a representative patient in Figure 3b; ibrutinib reduced the pre-treatment lymph node volume of 3 161 mL (equal to an estimated 3.2x1012 CLL cells) by >80% within two months, with continued improvement at 6 months. Similarly, ibrutinib also rapidly reduced the tumor burden in the spleen (Figure 3c). The degree of bone marrow infiltration was estimated from anti-CD79a stained bone marrow biopsies (Figure 3d). Irrespective of the initial tumor distribution, all four representative patients showed a pronounced decrease in the number of CLL cells over time, with the most rapid decrease occurring during the first two months (Figure 3e). \",\n"," 'One patient showed an apparent increase in the total number of CLL cells at 2 months despite reductions in disease burden in all three tissue sites due to a pronounced increase in ALC. This likely reflects release of CLL cells from the liver and intestinal tract, sites known to be significant reservoirs of B-cells, but not included in our model. The substantial reduction in total tumor burden cannot be explained by mere disease redistribution between different anatomic sites and suggests that there is a substantial amount of treatment-induced cell death. For example in three of the four patients shown in Figure 3e trillions of CLL cells \"disappear\" within the first two months; and that is only from the four sites amenable to study. However, evidence of cell death has been elusive. For example none of the patients in our study showed signs of tumor lysis syndrome, and in ficolled, viably frozen PBMCs we failed to detect an increase in cell death or apoptosis. When we switched to analyzing fresh whole blood samples we found that pre-treatment a median 2.4% of the circulating tumor cells were dead or dying. On day 28 on ibrutinib the frequency of dead or dying cells in circulation on average more than doubled compared to pre-treatment (P=0.03; Figure 3f). In vitro and murine studies suggest that both inhibition of cell adhesion and homing of circulating cells to tissue sites may contribute to treatment-induced lymphocytosis in CLL. Based on the rapid onset of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis, we hypothesized that efflux of CLL cells from tissue sites fuels the rise in circulating cells. To distinguish CLL cells in circulation from tissue-resident cells we made use of prior observations that CLL cells are activated and proliferate in the tissue microenvironment, and the two populations therefore differ in their immuno-phenotypic characteristics (Figure 4a). Expression of activation markers, including CD38, CD69, and CD86, and the proliferation marker Ki67 have been found to be downregulated by BCR inhibitors. As expected we found downregulation of these markers on circulating tumor cells on day 14 of ibrutinib therapy (data not shown). However, on day 2 concurrent with the increase in ALC the frequency of CD38 and Ki67 positive CLL cells in circulation increased significantly (P<=0.004, Figure 4b-c, and Supplementary Figure S2a) consistent with an influx of tissue resident cells into the blood. ',\n"," 'Next we used the relative change in ALC and in the fraction of circulating cells expressing Ki67 on day 2 to estimate to what degree the influx of tissue resident cells can account for the rise in ALC. Figure 4d illustrates these changes in a representative patient. The fraction of Ki67 expressing CLL cells as measured by flow cytometry pre-treatment was 6.4% in the peripheral blood and 12.8% in the lymph node. On day 2 the ALC had increased from 90 000/ul to 128 000/ul. Thus one third of the cells on day 2 were \"additional cells\". If all these additional cells are derived from the lymph node, the frequency of Ki67 positive cells is predicted to increase to 8.3%. Indeed the actual frequency measured by flow cytometry was 8.2%. We could assess eight patients in this manner and consistently, actual and predicted frequency of Ki67 expressing cells were virtually identical (R=0.99, P<0.001; Figure 4e). Using this same formula, we could also predict the expected rise in ALC based on the pre-treatment and day 2 Ki67 values (R=0.99, P<0.001; Figure 4f). Thus, the treatment-induced rise in ALC on day 2 can be accounted for by the influx of lymph-node resident CLL cells into the blood. Patients with certain types of leukemia may develop leukostasis leading to central nervous system and respiratory impairment. CLL patients, even those with very high lymphocyte counts, are rarely reported to suffer such complications; however, the rapid increase in ALC and the release of more activated cells from tissue sites might contribute an additional risk. Fortunately, no adverse events were attributed to leukostasis or hyperviscosity syndrome in this study, where the highest ALC was 475 000/mul, and 42% of patients had an ALC greater than 200 000/mul at least once during the first two months. Prospectively measured whole blood viscosity pre-treatment and on days 2 and 28 correlated with ALC, but did so even more strongly with hemoglobin (P<0.001, Figure 5a and b). Overall, there was no significant increase in whole blood viscosity on treatment (Figure 5c). Only in two patients a slightly increased whole blood viscosity was recorded, in one patient on day 2 with an ALC of 405 000/mul and in the other on day 28 with an ALC of 388 000/mul. ALC and hemoglobin were inversely correlated and patients with high ALC tended to be more anemic (Supplementary Figure S3). ',\n"," 'Interestingly, in patients with a pre-treatment hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL there was a decrease in mean hemoglobin from 11.7 to 10.9 g/dL during the first 28 days on treatment (P <= 0.02, Figure 5d). Figure 5e illustrates the interaction of hemoglobin and ALC on whole blood viscosity. Notably, the effect of a high ALC may in part be offset by a degree of anemia. Treatment-induced lymphocytosis has become a hallmark of BCR inhibitors in CLL. Here we report clinical and biologic aspects of ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis in patients with CLL; we show that the rise in ALC is virtually immediate, driven by the efflux of cells from tissue compartments, and paralleled by a substantial decrease in total tumor burden. In prospective measurements of whole blood viscosity we identified a small subset of patients in whom whole blood viscosity can exceed the normal range. However, no clinical adverse events were attributed to the lymphocytosis. Prior studies have reported treatment-induced lymphocytosis with BCR inhibitors within weeks of initiating treatment. Here we show that the onset of lymphocytosis occurs within hours of the first dose of ibrutinib and identify a group of patients in whom the lymphocytosis peaks within the first days and resolves before the end of the first cycle. The variability in degree and kinetics of the ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis in our cohort appears to be somewhat more heterogeneous than seen in other studies. While we included both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory patients of all age groups, and a large proportion of patients having del(17p), none of these characteristics predicted kinetics or degree of lymphocytosis. Of practical consequence is the observation that patients with a high pre-treatment ALC tend to have a rapid but relatively modest rise in ALC followed by fast resolution of the leukemic disease. Conversely, the group of patients showing a slow but continuous rise in ALC also had slow resolution of leukemic disease, had lower ALC pre-treatment, a higher proportion of patients with bulky disease, and commonly had IGHV mutated CLL. Thus, patients in this group would be predicted to have a more indolent course and extended benefit of treatment, at least with conventional chemoimmunotherapy. Therefore, as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease in other sites, it seems appropriate to continue treatment and await the eventual resolution of the lymphocytosis. ',\n"," 'Overall, compared to patients with IGHV unmutated CLL patients with IGHV mutated CLL had a greater relative increase in ALC and slower resolution of lymphocytosis confirming an earlier report. While IGHV mutated patients may therefore have lower response rates by IWCLL criteria, Woyach et al. recently showed that patients with persistent lymphocytosis have a similar PFS compared to those who reach an IWCLL objective response within the first year. In accordance with this, we did not find a significant difference in the degree of nodal response at 6 months among the three clusters, further suggesting that a prolonged lymphocytosis does not indicate an inferior response. Resolution of lymphadenopathy concurrent with the rise in ALC has been a strong indication that treatment-induced lymphocytosis is not a sign of progressive disease but reflects redistribution of tumor cells between different anatomic compartments. Here we present for the first time direct evidence that the initial rapid rise in ALC is driven by the release of CLL cells from tissues, in particular from the lymph node. This conclusion is based on the increased frequency of CLL cells expressing Ki67 and CD38 in the blood within 24 hours of starting ibrutinib and supported by a mathematical model derived from in vivo measurements in both blood and lymph node resident cells (Figure 4d). At least in the first 24h the bulk of cells released into the blood appear to come from the lymph node but we cannot rule out that some cells also egress from the bone marrow or other tissue sites. While several markers have been reported to be differentially expressed between CLL cells in the blood and tissues, not all are suitable to assess shifts in cell populations on ibrutinib. For example the activation markers CD69 and CD86 are so rapidly downregulated by ibrutinib that they cannot identify different cell populations once treatment is initiated. In contrast, we observed an increase of CXCR4 expression on CLL cells during treatment with ibrutinib (data not shown), which precludes the identification of the CXCR4dim/CD5bright population reported by Calissano et al. Similarly, on continued treatment both Ki67 and CD38 are downregulated by BCR inhibitors. Therefore, we could not distinguish different cell populations at later time-points. ',\n"," 'Thus, while we show that an efflux of cells from the tissue into the blood accounted for the observed rise in ALC by day 2, we cannot asses to what degree reduced homing of CLL cells to the tissue may contribute to the persistence of the lymphocytosis. However, the latter mechanism may contribute to the drop in ALC during treatment interruptions as seen in early studies that cycled ibrutinib 4 weeks on, one week off. Leukostasis is a rarely reported complication of CLL. However, in some settings the treatment-induced worsening of lymphocytosis has raised concerns about patient safety. We therefore prospectively incorporated whole blood viscosity measurements. Clinically we did not observe any symptoms or signs suggestive of leukostasis. Further, whole blood viscosity was only slightly elevated in two patients. While our experience is limited in patients with ALC greater than 300 000, the positive correlation between ALC and whole blood viscosity suggests that blood flow may be altered at very high ALCs especially in patients with normal hemoglobin (Figure 5e). The fact that most patients with high ALC had hemoglobin <10 g/dL could in part account for their normal viscosity readings and may justify withholding administration of blood products in patients with high ALC. Treatment-induced lymphocytosis has attracted considerable attention. However, in most patients, the circulating CLL cells are only a minor fraction of the total tumor volume. Importantly, the bulk of the disease, located in tissue sites such as bone marrow, lymph node, spleen and likely the intestinal tract, is substantially decreased on ibrutinib (Figure 3). Also, 27% of patients already had a reduction in ALC below baseline by two weeks. Thus, in most patients there is a rapid reduction in total tumor burden indicating an increased rate of cell death on ibrutinib. In fresh whole blood samples obtained pre-treatment we identified a median 2.4% of the circulating tumor cells as dead or dying, which is within the range of the previously calculated daily death rates in untreated CLL patients using heavy water labeling. Our measurements suggest that the frequency of dead or dying cells in circulation more than doubled on ibrutinib (Figure 3f). As dead cells are constantly cleared through the reticuloendothelial system this is most consistent with an increased death rate. ',\n"," 'An absolute increase in the rate of cell death by 2% per day would result in a >50% reduction in tumor burden within 28 days, which is in good agreement with the initial kinetics of tumor response seen in many patients. In addition, inhibition of tumor proliferation by ibrutinib, as reported elsewhere, will prevent or reduce the replacement of the dying cells. A slow but steady decay rate of the tumor is also in accordance with the notable absence of reports of tumor lysis syndrome with single agent ibrutinib, and the modest degree of apoptosis induced by ibrutinib in vitro. As BCR inhibitors decrease NF-kappaB signaling and expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2A1, cell death may be a consequence of reduced pro-survival signaling rather than of a direct cytotoxic effect. However, this remains to be more fully evaluated. Ibrutinib is active in several mature B-cell malignancies. Notably, patients with MCL also frequently experience treatment-induced lymphocytosis. Although the mechanisms leading to redistribution of disease may be similar to those in CLL, patterns of lymphocytosis in MCL and their relation to clinical response and patient safety need to be independently studied. Results presented here support the positive benefit to risk profile of continued ibrutinib treatment for most patients with CLL showing treatment-induced lymphocytosis. In fact, treatment-induced lymphocytosis in CLL may be viewed as an on-target effect of BCR inhibitors, with the caveat that it may be missed as the peak can occur within the first days or even hours of starting ibrutinib.

Alemtuzumab containing chemoimmunotherapy regimens can be effective but frequently cause serious infections. We report a phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of a short duration regimen combining pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low dose high frequency rituximab (PAR) designed to decrease the risk of treatment associated infections and limit loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. The study enrolled 39 patients with progressive CLL that was either relapsed/refractory (n=36) or previously untreated with 17p13 deletion (17p13-)(n=3). Thirteen (33%) patients had both 17p13- and TP53 mutations predicted to be dysfunctional and eight patients had purine analogue refractory CLL without TP53 dysfunction. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed therapy with only five (13%) patients having treatment limiting toxicity, and no treatment related deaths. Twenty-two (56%) patients responded to treatment with 11 (28%) complete responses (four with incomplete bone marrow recovery). Median progression free survival was 7.2 months, time to next treatment 9.1 months, and overall survival 34.1 months. The majority of deaths (82%) were caused by progressive disease including transformed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n=6). Correlative studies showed that low dose rituximab activates complement and NK cells without a profound and sustained decrease in expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. We conclude that PAR is a tolerable and effective therapy for CLL and that low dose rituximab therapy can activate innate immune cytotoxic mechanisms without substantially decreasing CD20 expression. Patients with purine analogue refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and progressive disease with TP53 dysfunction have limited treatment options and poor survival. Although alemtuzumab monotherapy is often effective at clearing CLL cells in the circulation and bone marrow, patients with bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly rarely achieve durable responses. Alemtuzumab is also an effective therapy against CLL cells with TP53 dysfunction (deletion/mutation), although complete remissions are rare and progression free survival is usually short. Alemtuzumab has thus been combined with other drugs in order to improve efficacy. Alemtuzumab and rituximab is effective and tolerable but also has limited efficacy against bulky disease. Combination therapy with alemtuzumab and fludarabine has been reported to be more effective than fludarabine monotherapy but there are concerns about the safety of these chemoimmunotherapy regimens because of excess mortality for both patients undergoing their first therapy for progressive disease and those treated for relapsed/refractory disease. ',\n"," 'A safer and more effective chemoimmunotherapy regimen could be of value for patients with very high risk progressive CLL. We conducted a phase II clinical trial to test whether a combination therapy with pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and lower dose higher frequency rituximab (PAR) could be effective and tolerable for patients with relapsed/refractory or progressive CLL with 17p13 deletion (17p13-) and could limit loss of CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells. Pentostatin was included in the regimen with the aim of decreasing CLL tumor bulk by targeting the residual purine analogue sensitive clones of the CLL cell population with a drug that could have less myelotoxicity than fludarabine. The rituximab administration schedule was based on data showing that lower dose and higher frequency therapy can decrease the loss of CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells that occurs with standard dose rituximab therapy. The duration of the therapy regimen was limited to three months to reduce the risk of prolonged immunosuppression. Our study shows that PAR is an effective and tolerable therapy for this patient population and that use of low dose rituximab decreases trogocytosis (\"shaving\") and thus loss of expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. This two-stage phase II clinical trial was conducted at the Mayo Clinic Rochester and University of Iowa with the approval of both Institutional Review Boards according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00669318). Patients were eligible for accrual if they had a diagnosis of progressive CLL (including the small lymphocytic lymphoma variant) by standard criteria and either had been previously treated for CLL (no more than three purine analogue containing regimens) or were previously untreated for their CLL and had 17p13- detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Exclusion criteria were organ failure (creatinine >2x upper limit of normal (ULN), direct hyperbilirubinemia or AST >3x ULN, >class II New York Heart Association heart failure, or an ECOG performance status >3), infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C, active autoimmune cytopenia, and alemtuzumab therapy <2 months previously. Prognostic factor analysis was determined using FISH analysis of peripheral blood, IGHV mutation analysis, TP53 mutation analysis, and expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 as previously described. Therapy started with rituximab 20 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (M-W-F). ',\n"," 'second dose of rituximab with a daily dose escalation of 3-10-30 mg/d if tolerated and was then administered at 30 mg SQ M-W-F starting on day 8. Pentostatin 2 mg/m2 IV was started on day 8 and repeated every 2 weeks. The first cycle of therapy included the week of alemtuzumab dose escalation and 4 subsequent weeks of full dose therapy for a total of 5 weeks. Subsequent cycles were 4 weeks of full dose therapy. Leukocyte growth factor (pegfilgrastim 6 mg SQ x 1 day or GM-CSF 500 mug/d SQ x 5 days) administration was started 48 hours after each dose of pentostatin and all patients had Pneumocystis and herpes virus prophylaxis during therapy and then for 6 months after the last dose of alemtuzumab. Blood cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral assays were done using a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method weekly during treatment with alemtuzumab and all patients with detectable CMV viremia were treated with either valganciclovir or ganciclovir. Patients tolerating therapy and without disease progression received a minimum of 2 cycles of PAR therapy. After completing 2 cycles of therapy, those patients who had achieved a complete clinical response underwent a CT scan of their chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with no pathological radiological findings then underwent a bone marrow study to test for residual CLL. If the bone marrow biopsy showed no morphological evidence of residual CLL, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (see below for details) was performed to evaluate for residual CLL cells. Those patients with an IHC negative (stringent) complete response (CR) had no further therapy. All other patients without progressive disease received a 3rd cycle of therapy. Patients were evaluated by physical examination and blood testing one week after starting therapy, subsequently every 2 weeks during treatment, monthly for 6 months after completing therapy, and then at 9 and 12 months after completing therapy. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 http://ctep.cancer.gov/ with the exception of cytopenias which were graded using the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicity in CLL studies. Response to treatment was measured 2 months after completion of therapy using standard National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 (NCI-WG96) criteria. ',\n"," 'In patients who achieved a complete clinical remission by NCI-WG96 criteria, the bone marrow biopsy was evaluated for residual CLL cells by IHC studies (streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method) with antibodies directed against CD3, CD5, CD23 and PAX5 using standard techniques. The specific focus of the correlative studies was to examine the effects of the first week of therapy with low dose rituximab (20 mg/m2 IV) on circulating CLL cells. Four peripheral blood samples were drawn from each patient: Sample 1 on day 1 of therapy prior to the first dose of rituximab, sample 2 on day 3 before therapy (48 hours after the first dose of rituximab), sample 3 on day 3 one hour after completion of therapy (rituximab infusion followed by SQ alemtuzumab injection), and sample 4 before treatment on day 8 of therapy. Immunophenotypic analyses on CLL cells were performed on the first 13 evaluable patients based on analyses starting with whole blood as previously described. These assays were performed within three days of the blood draw. Alternatively, in the next group of 18 patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated within 2 hours of the blood draw and were then frozen and stored at -150 C as previously described. The PBMC were subsequently thawed in AIM V media (Gibco) and analyzed as above except that the erythrocyte lysis step was omitted. Due to minor adjustments in the blood specimen collection protocols, the absolute lymphocyte counts were measured only in the first and fourth blood sample in the first group of patients, but absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were determined for all four freshly isolated blood samples for the second group of patients. Finally, in certain cases only three (of four) blood samples were obtained for some patients, and therefore the number of data points for specific times in the figures varied slightly. All immunophenotypic assays were run in duplicate. CLL cells were identified as low side scatter, PerCP CD45+ (BD Pharmingen), and PE CD19+ (eBioscience). Levels of CD20 on CLL cells were measured as previously described by probing with ofatumumab or rituximab, followed by secondary development with Al488-labeled mAb HB43, specific for human Fc (American Type Tissue Collection). Deposition of complement C3d fragments was measured with Al488-labeled mAb 1H8. FITC-labeled mAbs specific for complement control proteins CD46 and CD59 were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Monoclonal antibody HD1A, specific for CD55, was the kind gift of Prof. ',\n"," \"Paul Morgan, University of Wales, Cardiff. Certain monoclonal antibodies, including HD1A, were labeled by reaction with Alexa 488 N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the manufacturers' directions (Molecular Probes). In order to test for a correlation between deposited levels of C3d and expression of CD20, a subset of Day 3 Post PBMC samples were first incubated with ofatumumab, washed, and then probed with a cocktail of FITC mAb 1H8, PE CD19, PerCP CD45 and Al647 HB43. Unless otherwise noted, all results for these measurements are normalized to values obtained for the blood samples taken just before the first rituximab infusion. The results for the fresh and frozen samples are plotted in the same figures, but different symbols are used to identify CLL cells that were evaluated in either whole blood (open circles) or as PBMC (closed circles). In a few patients, levels of CD20 in the pre-treatment blood samples were very low (less than 5% of the median levels for the other patients, likely because of recent rituximab treatment), or ALC were less than 5 x 109/L, and these blood samples were not included in the analyses. NK cells were evaluated in blood specimens, taken before and 48 hours after the first dose of rituximab, for changes in numbers as well as expression of CD16 and CD54 as previously described. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from blood by Ficoll separation and red blood cells lysed with ACK buffer. 2 x 106 mononuclear cells were stained with CD54-PE, CD56-A647, CD16-FITC, CD3-APC-Cy7 and CD19-PE-Cy7, fixed and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson LSR II for changes in the percentage counts and expression of CD16 and CD54. This study used a two-stage Simon optimum design with a primary endpoint of CR rate as defined by the NCI-WG96 criteria. The secondary end points were to determine the overall response rate, toxicity of treatment, time to subsequent therapy, and overall and progression free survival. Based on our experience with treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL and patients with progressive disease and 17p13-, we proposed that the largest CR rate where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population was 10%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population would be 30%. A total of 38 evaluable patients provided 93% power, with a 7% Type I error rate. \",\n"," 'The progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. Time to subsequent therapy (TTT) is defined as the time from registration to the time of initiation of subsequent therapy for progressive CLL. Patients who underwent allogeneic transplant or received subsequent treatment before meeting criteria for disease progression were censored for TTT. The distribution of all time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier and differences between subgroups were evaluated using log-rank statistics. The results of rituximab infusions on cell phenotype were evaluated by the Wilcoxin signed-rank test and relationships between continuous variables were examined based on Spearman rank order correlation (Sigma stat). Forty-one patients were enrolled from July 2008 to February 2013 and 39 were evaluable. Two patients did not start treatment. One patient was found to have concomitant Hodgkin lymphoma and the other a serious systemic infection during pre-treatment evaluation. The characteristics of the 39 evaluable patients are summarized in Table I. Complete prior therapy records were available for 34 of the 36 previously treated patients. Of these, 29 (85%) had previously received purine analogue based chemoimmunotherapy. Thirteen (45%) patients were considered to be purine analogue refractory because they had not responded to (n=12), or had a PFS of less than one year following their most recent purine analogue containing chemoimmunotherapy regimen (n=1). Thirty-four (94%) patients had previously received rituximab-based therapy and 8 (22%) had previously received alemtuzumab. TP53 was evaluated by FISH analysis for deletion in all patients and for mutations predicted to be dysfunctional in exons 4-9 by sequencing in 34 patients including all 15 patients with 17p13-. TP53 mutations were detected in 18 (53%) of evaluated patients. Of these patients 13 (72%) also had 17p13- and were thus presumed to have loss of TP53 function (TP53 dysfunction) in the affected CLL cells. Five patients had TP53 mutations without 17p13- and two had 17p13- without detection of a TP53 mutation in the remaining allele. Two patients had both 17p13- and 11q22- in the same CLL clone as previously described, and of these, one also had a TP53 mutation. IGHV analysis showed somatic hypermutation in three (23%) of 13 patients with both 17p13- and TP53 mutation, and two of five patients without 17p13- who had TP53 mutation. ',\n"," 'Both patients with 17p13- and no detected TP53 mutation had unmutated IGHV. Twenty one (54%) patients on this study had very-high risk CLL based on predicted loss of TP53 function (n=13) or purine analogue refractory disease in the absence of evidence of TP53 dysfunction (n=8). Of the 13 patients with purine analogue refractory CLL, 5 (38%) had both a TP53 mutation and 17p13-, one had a TP53 mutation without 17p13-, three had 11q22-, and three were not tested for TP53 mutations. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed all planned therapy including two patients who completed therapy per protocol after two cycles because they had achieved an IHC negative CR. Of the 13 patients who did not complete the planned therapy, four patients received only one cycle, five received two cycles, and four started but did not complete the third cycle of therapy. The reasons for not completing therapy were disease progression (n=4), adverse events (n=5), treating physician and patient choice (n=1), financial hardship (n=1), change to alternative therapy regimen (n=1), and diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma (n=1). There were 28 therapy delays in 23 patients because of adverse events (n=24) and for administrative reasons (n=4). There were no dose reductions for alemtuzumab or rituximab. Pentostatin doses were omitted 17 times in 11 patients and reduced five times in five patients because of adverse events. There were 57 grade 3-4 adverse events at least possibly related to treatment in 27 patients. Of these 22 were neutropenia, 11 were thrombocytopenia, and 8 were infections/febrile neutropenia. Other grade 3-4 hematological events were anemia (n=2), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)(n=2), hemorrhage (n=2), aplastic anemia (n=1), fatigue (n=3), fever (n=3), myalgia (n=1), hypotension (n=1) and hyperuricemia (n=1). There were no deaths attributable to treatment. CMV reactivation occurred in 14 (36%) patients with a median viral load of 2,000 copies/ml (maximum 34,500), and was first detected in cycle 1 of therapy in 10 patients and cycle 2 of therapy in four patients. Eight patients had only one positive test for CMV viremia, five had positive tests for two sequential weeks, and one had positive tests for three sequential weeks. All patients were treated and there were no grade 3-4 events attributable to CMV reactivation, and no interruptions in treatment. AIHA occurred for the first time in two patients during therapy with PAR. ',\n"," \"One patient developed AIHA in cycle 1 of therapy three days after his first dose of pentostatin and the other during cycle 3 of therapy. Both patients responded well to subsequent therapy with high dose methylprednisolone and rituximab. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL, Richter's transformation) was diagnosed in 6 patients at a median time of 6.0 months (range 2.4-17.4) after initiation of PAR. Five of these patients had not responded to the PAR treatment regimen and one had achieved a CRi. Three of these patients had 17p13- and TP53 mutations (TP53 dysfunction) and one had a TP53 mutation without 17p13- (one patient did not have TP53 sequencing data). The DLBCL cells had the same immunoglobulin gene rearrangement as the patients CLL cells (clonal transformation) in all four patients tested. Only two patients had their DLBCL tissue tested for Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) by IHC and both were negative. Four patients developed DLBCL prior to any subsequent treatment for their CLL at a median time of 4.4 months (range 2.4-7.2 months). Two patients developed DLBCL after receiving subsequent treatment for progressive CLL. All six patients died from DLBCL with a median time from diagnosis of DLBCL to death of 9.3 months (5.2-19.3). No additional hematological malignancies were observed. One patient was diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma 3.2 months after initiation of the treatment regimen. Of the five patients aged 70 years or older, two completed three cycles of therapy per protocol. Three patients received two cycles of therapy but did not receive the third cycle because of decisions by the patients and treating physicians based on the severity of cytopenias and social issues. Twenty-two (56%, 95% CI 40-72) patients responded to therapy with 4 (10%) CR, 7 (18%) CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), and 11 (28%) partial responses (PR). Seven (18%) patients had stable disease (SD), and 10 (26%) patients had progressive disease (PD) prior to response evaluation. Four patients (3 CR and 1 CRi) met the criteria for a stringent complete response (IHC negative bone marrow study). The median follow-up for patients still alive was 35 months (range 3-58). Twenty-four patients have had progressive disease. The median progression free survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3,18.3) (Figure 1A). Twenty-one patients have received subsequent treatment for progressive CLL. \",\n"," \"In addition, four patients received additional treatment for their CLL at their physicians' discretion before meeting standard criteria for progression and were censored for time to re-treatment. Seven patients proceeded to planned reduced intensity allogeneic transplant after completing this treatment regimen. These patients had all responded to therapy (5 PR, 1 CRi, 1 stringent CR) and were censored for time to re-treatment. The median time to re-treatment was 9.1 months (95% CI: 5.7,27.0)(Figure 1B). Seventeen patients have died from progressive disease including DLBCL (n=14), infection (n=2, pneumonia, sepsis), and complications of RIC allotransplant (n=1). Median overall survival was 34.1 months (95% CI: 13.6, not reached)(Figure 1C). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients predicted to have loss of TP53 function (17p13- and dysfunctional TP53 mutation) responded to therapy (3 CR/CRi, 4 PR). Of the 3 patients with a CR/CRi, one was censored at 6 months because of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (RIC allotransplant). The other two patients, both of whom had mutated IGHV and one of whom had purine analogue refractory CLL, have not received subsequent treatment after being followed for 27.1 and 41.2 months. Of the 4 patients with a PR, two were previously untreated with 17p13- and were censored at 4.3 and 6.6 months because they underwent RIC allotransplant. The other two patients had subsequent treatment at 8.3 months and 27 months. The latter patient had mutated IGHV. One of the two patients with 17p13- without detectable TP53 mutations had a PR and subsequently was censored at 5.4 months because of additional therapy including a RIC allotransplant. The other patient had PD and died from progressive CLL at 9.8 months. Two of the 5 patients with TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p13- responded to therapy (CRi). Of these patients one with mutated IGHV had not yet been retreated at 46.8 months and the other had unmutated IGHV and required subsequent treatment at 7.5 months. Of the 3 patients who did not respond, one had mutated IGHV. Both patients with a CLL clone with 17p13- and 11q22- had PD before completing their PAR treatment. Outcomes in patients with TP53 dysfunction (17p13- and TP53 mutation, n = 13) were compared to the other patients on this clinical trial. \",\n"," 'There were no significant differences in the overall response rate (54% vs. 58%, p=1), CR/CRi (23% vs. 31%), TTT (median 9.1 vs. 8.3 months, p=0.92) or OS (median 16.8 months vs. not reached, p=0.20) (Supplementary Figure 1A). The comparison of patients with 17p13- to those without 17p13- showed no significant differences in these parameters (data not shown). Seven (54%, 95% CI:25,81) of the 13 patients with purine analogue refractory CLL responded to therapy with 4 CR/CRi and 3 PR. This was not significantly different from the 56% response rate (95%CI: 30,80) among the 16 patients responsive to their most recent purine analogue containing treatment regimen. Of the seven (54%) purine analogue refractory patients who had no detectible TP53 defects, all had unmutated IGHV and 3 had 11q22-. Five of these patients responded to treatment (2 CRi, 3 PR). Three patients were censored because of subsequent treatment at 4.2, 6.8, and 8.5 months. The TTT in the other four patients ranged from 1.3-11.4 months and three patients have died. There was no difference between purine analogue refractory and sensitive patients for TTT (median 9.1 vs. 25.9 months, p=0.97) or OS (18.3 months vs. not reached, p=0.27)(Supplementary Figure 1B). CLL patients with TP53 dysfunction or purine analogue refractory disease in the absence of detectable TP53 dysfunction comprise a cohort with a very high risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. Patients with very high risk CLL (n=21) did not have a significantly different TTT (median 9.1 months vs. 8.3 months, p=0.90) or OS (median 18.3 months vs. not reached, p=0.18) (Supplementary Figure 1C) compared to the 18 patients who did not have very high risk CLL. Three of the 8 patients previously treated with alemtuzumab responded to treatment (all PR). Of the 5 patients 70 years or older (n=5), three responded to treatment (1 CR, 2 PR). The median TTT in this older population was 8.3 months (range 2.7-33.9), three patients died at 7.1, 10.8, and 23.4 months after initiation of PAR and two were alive at 50.8 and 58.0 months. We studied all 26 patients with a baseline ALC >5 x109/L who had not received rituximab therapy for at least one month prior to starting the PAR regimen and had the appropriate specimens collected per protocol. ',\n"," 'The results from evaluation of the effects of IV infusion of low doses (20 mg/m2) of rituximab on normalized levels of ALC (n=14) and of CD20 on circulating CLL cells (n=26) extends and generalizes our previous report in which only six patients received low dose rituximab therapy. The results of infusion of rituximab on day 1 were still evident on day 3, as manifested by decreases in ALC, based on measurements in blood samples (Day 3 Pre) taken just before the second rituximab infusion (p<0.001)(Figure 2A). Moreover, the second rituximab infusion (on day 3) led to rapid and substantial decreases in ALC; on average ALC were reduced to 30% of the respective values before initiation of therapy (p<0.001)(Figure 2A). The first 3 mg dose of alemtuzumab was injected SQ on day 3 after the rituximab infusion, but it is unlikely that this low SQ dose had an immediate effect on ALC. Moreover, although rituximab was also infused on day 5, and alemtuzumab was administered SQ on days 4 and 5 (10 mg and 30 mg, respectively), by day 8 there was a modest, but significant increase in ALC (p<0.05)(Figure 2A), very likely reflecting re-equilibration, between day 5 and day 8, of additional CLL cells into the bloodstream from other compartments. Although cells were indeed cleared from the bloodstream on day 3 (Figure 2A, Day 3 Post), we observed simultaneous loss of CD20 from surviving circulating cells (Figure 2B), and the % of CD20 lost was independent of the starting CD20 levels for a given patient CLL cell population (p=0.733 for fresh samples and p=0.467 for PBMC, Spearman Rank Order correlation). Thus, as we reported previously, based on clinical studies and in vitro models, we find that both trogocytosis (\"shaving\") of CD20 and clearance (both processes likely mediated by fixed tissue macrophages) occurs simultaneously for populations of circulating CLL cells that are opsonized with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab. In order to test for additional validation of this idea, we also examined surviving CLL cells for deposition of C3d fragments. It is well established that cells that are opsonized with rituximab should activate complement, thus allowing in vivo covalent tagging with C3b fragments which will rapidly decay to C3d. ',\n"," 'In the present low-dose rituximab paradigm, if these C3d-tagged cells are not cleared, but CD20 is partially removed, then evidence that the cells must have been previously opsonized with rituximab would be the \"residual\" covalently bound C3d. Indeed, we find that among the surviving CLL cells, significant amounts of C3d fragments are indeed demonstrable (Figure 2C). We examined CLL cells collected on day 3 after therapy (Day 3 Post) for different patients, and we also find that there is a linear correlation between the amount of deposited C3d on the cells and the residual levels of CD20 (correlation coefficient=0.833, p=0.005)(Figures 2D,E). Moreover, dot plots for CLL cells analyzed in these Day 3 Post samples from two representative patients also reveal an approximately linear correlation between the amount of deposited C3d and residual levels of CD20 (Figure 2F). This is reasonable because within a given CLL cell population, the cells with the most CD20 before rituximab infusion will have the most CD20 after, because the % of CD20 loss is not dependent on starting CD20 levels, and higher starting levels of CD20 should of course presage more complement activation and more C3d deposition. Thus, even though CD20 is reduced, the \"signature\" on cells that had been opsonized with rituximab will be residual CD20 along with deposited C3d. Finally, it is important to note that by day 8, expression of CD20 on circulating cells had increased compared to the day 3 post (Figure 2B), indicating that the lower rituximab doses had less profound long-term effects on CD20 levels than has been found for the standard 375 mg/m2 dose of rituximab (>90% loss of CD20 expression). In addition, because the CD20 target is \"restored\" on circulating cells, the next rituximab dose would, as previously reported, be expected to continue to target and clear the CD20 positive cells. We also probed the CLL cells from the Day 3 post treatment samples with the monoclonal anti-human Fc antibody HB43 in order to determine if any rituximab was still bound to the cells soon after completion of the second rituximab infusion. Of 23 patient samples that could be evaluated, 15 had no measureable bound rituximab, but 8 had modest level of rituximab bound, corresponding to 16+-7 % (p<0.001) of the maximum binding that was possible, based on reacting naive CLL cells (sample 1) with excess rituximab (or ofatumumab) followed by monoclonal antibody HB43. ',\n"," 'Several lines of evidence suggest that complement control proteins (CCP) on cancer cells are likely to promote resistance of these cells to monoclonal antibody-based therapies that depend upon complement activation to promote cell elimination. Indeed, under certain conditions CCP might be up-regulated in response to complement-dependent therapies; that is, cells under attack by rituximab and alemtuzumab that express the highest levels of CCP are more likely to survive and this could lead to evolution of more CDC- resistant phenotypes. Therefore, we examined levels of the three key CCP on CLL cells: CD46, CD55 and CD59, before, and after the rituximab and alemtuzumab infusions. Our results (Supplementary Figures 2A-C) indicate that soon after infusion of rituximab there appear to be small but significant decreases in expression of these proteins on surviving CLL cells. These results may be most readily explained based on \"innocent bystander\" decreases in the levels of one or more of these proteins, which can accompany trogocytosis of CD20 mediated by rituximab However, by day 8, after the three infusions of rituximab and alemtuzumab, expression of the three CCP had increased modestly and had returned to close to baseline levels, following the general pattern seen for CD20. We have previously shown in vitro that rituximab-coated target cells can induce changes in NK cell phenotype consistent with NK cell activation including a rapid down-modulation of CD16 and up regulation of a number of markers including CD54. In vivo studies confirmed these changes take place within four hours of therapy with standard dose rituximab, and also are associated with trafficking of NK cells out of the circulation. In this study 8 patients had suitable blood samples taken before and 48 hours after the initiation of RTX therapy with an NK count of at least 0.5% of mononuclear cells in the pre-therapy sample. For logistical reasons, the post rituximab sample was obtained 48 hours after the initiation of the rituximab infusion. As illustrated in Figure 3, low dose rituximab therapy resulted in a significant decrease in NK cell CD16 expression (p=0.001) (Figure 3A), up regulation of surface CD54 (p=0.04) (Figure 3B), and a reduction in NK cell numbers (p<0.0001)(Figure 3C), which indicates NK cell activation by treatment with low dose rituximab. We report the results of treatment of patients with high risk and relapsed/refractory CLL using a novel chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining a purine analogue with alemtuzumab and low dose rituximab. ',\n"," 'This regimen was relatively well tolerated with 67% patients receiving the planned duration of therapy. Only 5 (12.8%) patients did not complete therapy because of treatment related adverse events and there were no treatment related deaths. The overall response rate was 56% of patients with half of the responders achieving a CR/CRi. Despite the short median progression free survival, the median overall survival was 34 months. In addition, patients with very-high risk CLL as defined by TP53 dysfunction or purine analogue refractory disease (n=21) had similar responses to treatment compared to those patients without these adverse characteristics. The correlative laboratory studies showed that the low dose rituximab regimen activated both complement and NK cells and resulted in more limited loss as well as more rapid recovery of CD20 expression by CLL cells compared to that previous demonstrated for treatment with standard dose rituximab. In this small study the CR/CRi rate of 28% was lower than the 30% considered the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the regimen. However, the response to treatment compared favorably with the results of recently reported previous studies in similar patients using other alemtuzumab based combination therapies. The toxicity of the PAR regimen appears to have been less severe than that previously reported for CLL treatment regimens including fludarabine and alemtuzumab used either concomitantly or sequentially. Factors contributing to the lower toxicity of the PAR regimen could have included required prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and CMV monitoring with treatment of CMV reactivation, and the limited duration (maximum of 3 months) of alemtuzumab therapy. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was subsequently diagnosed in 6 (15%) patients treated with PAR and was an important cause of treatment failure and mortality. The study population had a high frequency of advanced stage disease (59%), TP53 dysfunction (33%), 11q22- (15%), unmutated IGHV (69%), and ZAP70 expression (72%), all of which are associated with an increased risk of DLBCL in patients with CLL. Although treatment of CLL with alemtuzumab and purine analogues has also been reported to be associated with development of DLBCL, the role of these drugs in the development of DLBCL remains unclear. In this study, the median interval between starting PAR therapy and the diagnosis of DLBCL was only 4.4 months from start of PAR in patients who did not receive subsequent therapy for their CLL. ',\n"," \"This short interval suggests that DLBCL developed prior to the start of PAR therapy and the treatment of the CLL could have accelerated the diagnosis of the DLBCL rather than being a causative factor in these patients. Of note, a similar high rate of DLBCL was recently reported in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. The high rate of DLBCL in our study population is clearly a serious problem, but we cannot determine whether or not PAR therapy contributed to this complication. There is now substantial evidence that use of conventional doses of rituximab (375 - 500 mg/m2) for the treatment of CLL results in a considerable decrease in CD20 expression by the circulating CLL cells, which results in a loss of efficacy of this drug. In this study, we tested the effect of higher frequency, low dose IV rituximab on expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells and on the activation of NK cells. Our correlative measurements confirm that at rituximab doses as low as 20mg/m2, cells undergo three separate and interrelated fates. These doses provide sufficient rituximab to opsonize and clear the majority of circulating cells, because at the end of the infusion on day 3, ALC levels are reduced considerably (Figure 2A). However, the surviving cells do suffer some loss of CD20 and are also covalently tagged with C3d, indicating that they were also opsonized with rituximab, but were not cleared (Figures 2B,C). Indeed, as demonstrated previously, both clearance and loss of expression of CD20 appear to occur simultaneously, and both processes are mediated in part by the same effector cells, fixed tissue macrophages which express Fcgamma receptors. We also can confirm that loss of CD20 is less pronounced under these low-dose rituximab conditions, and that considerable restoration of CD20 on circulating cells is readily seen based on analyses of blood samples on day 8 (Figure 2B). Moreover, we found that complement was activated based on the appearance of C3d-tagged cells, and the present studies, although limited in time, suggest that CCP are not up-regulated in response to rituximab or alemtuzumab therapy (Supplementary Figure 2). We also found that cells with the most residual CD20 had the greatest amount of deposited C3d. \",\n"," \"This analysis cannot be performed after infusion of large quantities (> 300 mg) of rituximab or ofatumumab, because under these conditions loss of CD20 reaches values in excess of 90%. Our correlative studies also demonstrated that a single, low dose (20 mg/m2 IV) of rituximab therapy can induce activation of NK cells within two days of therapy as indicated by down-modulation of CD16, upregulation of CD54 and a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells (Figure 3). These findings are similar to those found in our prior studies exploring the effect of full dose rituximab on NK cell activation despite a number of differences between the current and prior studies including dose of rituximab (20mg/m2 vs. 375mg/m2), patients (CLL versus lymphoma without significant numbers of circulating B cells) and timing of the post-rituximab sampling (48 hours versus 4 hours). Together, this data suggests the short-term effect of low dose rituximab on NK cell activation is similar to that seen with standard dose therapy. The strengths of our study are detailed characterization of the biology of the patients' malignant B cells, and the comprehensive follow up of all patients after completion of therapy. The study design allowed for collection of serial blood samples that could address important questions about the optimal dosing of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. The limitations of this study include the relatively small number of patients and the limited data on TTT because of early initiation of subsequent treatment, especially in patients proceeding to planned RIC allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This limitation is especially important with regard to determining the benefit of PAR therapy in CLL patients with very high risk disease, where the lack of differences in outcome could reflect the small sample size rather than a true equivalence of treatment efficacy. In conclusion, PAR is effective and tolerable therapy that could be of value in management of patients with very-high risk CLL who fail targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and in patients requiring disease control before therapy with allogeneic transplant or chimeric antigen receptor therapy. This study showed that low dose rituximab activates components of the innate immune system known to be important in its anti-CLL effect without substantially decreasing CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells after treatment. \",\n"," '.

We investigated the safety and activity of ibrutinib in previously untreated and relapsed or refractory CLL with TP53 aberrations. In this investigator-initiated, single-arm phase 2 study we enrolled eligible adult patients with active CLL with TP53 aberrations at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD, USA). Patients received 28-day cycles of ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of limiting toxicities. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment at 24 weeks in all evaluable patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01500733, and is fully enrolled. Between Dec 22, 2011 and Jan 2, 2014 we enrolled 51 patients; 47 had CLL with deletion 17p13.1 and four carried a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. All patients had active disease requiring therapy. 35 enrolled patients had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR 12 9-27 0). 33 previously untreated patients and 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluable for response at 24 weeks. 32 (97%; 95% CI 86-100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response, including partial response in 18 patients (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One patient had progressive disease at 0 4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) achieved a partial response and six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis; the remaining three (20%) patients had stable disease. Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient), anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient). Grade 3 pneumonia occurred in three (6%) patients, and grade 3 rash in one (2%) patient. The activity and safety profile of single-agent ibrutinib in CLL with TP53 aberrations is encouraging and supports its consideration as a novel treatment option for patients with this high-risk disease in both first-line and second-line settings Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, Danish Cancer Society, Novo Nordisk Foundation, National Institutes of Health Medical Research Scholars Program, and Pharmacyclics Inc. ',\n"," 'Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard of care for patients who need treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Patients with TP53 aberrations respond less well to treatment than do those without this high-risk genetic lesion resulting in early relapse and inferior survival. Deletion of chromosome band 17p13.1 results in loss of one allele of the tumour suppressor gene TP53, and the other allele is often incapacitated through point mutations. The P53 pathway induces cell death in response to DNA damage, and its inactivation is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. In previously untreated patients the prevalence of deletion 17p13.1 and TP53 mutations, which often occur together, ranges from 7% to 11 5%. However, selection of chemotherapyresistant clones during treatment increases the prevalence of TP53 aberrations at relapse. The identification of appropriate treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations is a research priority. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has long been viewed as the only option for long-term disease control in these patients. Consensus guidelines recommend allogeneic stem-cell transplantation during first remission for patients with CLL and TP53 aberrations. However, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is not broadly applicable due to the advanced age of most patients with CLL, and transplant-related mortality remains a concern. Alternative treatment options are scarce. The anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab is active in CLL with TP53 aberrations but most responses are not durable and the agent is associated with a high incidence of grade 3 or worse infections. Promising new options include kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib or idelalisib, which have shown activity in relapsed or refractory patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including deletion 17p13.1. With the advent of these novel therapies the role of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations is being re-assessed. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is an orally bioavailable, covalent inhibitor of Bruton\\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK).\"] Once-daily administration causes sustained inactivation of the kinase resulting in inhibition of B-cell receptor signalling and tumour-microenvironment interactions. In a 2013 report of a phase 1b-2 study, 71% of patients in the ibrutinib 420 mg dosing group with relapsed or refractory CLL achieved a response according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria. An additional 20% of patients had partial responses with lymphocytosis. More recently, a randomised comparison of ibrutinib versus the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab showed superior activity of ibrutinib over ofatumumab, including improved survival. ',\n"," 'of ibrutinib over ofatumumab, including improved survival. Based on these studies and the encouraging activity of ibrutinib in patients with deletion 17p13.1, ibrutinib received full Food and Drug Administration approval in the USA on July 28, 2014 for patients with CLL who have received at least one previous therapy, and for those with CLL with deletion 17p13.1. Approval by the European Commission for patients who have received at least one previous therapy, or in first-line CLL patients in the presence of deletion 17p13.1 or TP53 mutation in those unsuitable for chemotherapy was granted on Oct 17, 2014. In view of the encouraging activity of ibrutinib in CLL and the few treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of ibrutinib in this high-risk patient population. For this phase 2, open-label, single-center, investigator-initiated study, between Dec 22, 2011, and Jan 2, 2014, we enrolled previously untreated patients with CLL and patients with relapsed or refractory disease at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, USA. Eligibility criteria included: diagnosis of CLL, including small lymphocytic lymphoma according to WHO criteria, with deletion 17p13.1 identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) in at least 10% of nuclei scored or presence of TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1; active disease requiring therapy according to the IWCLL criteria; age 18 years or older; ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; neutrophil count of at least 500 cells per muL. Exclusion criteria included: being younger than 18 years; transformed disease; autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia necessitating steroid therapy; impaired hepatic function (total bilirubin level >=1 5xthe upper limit of normal [ULN] unless due to Gilbert\\'s disease, or aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >=2 5xULN unless caused by infiltration of the liver), impaired renal function (creatinine concentration >=2 0 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate <=50 mL/min), active Hepatitis B infection, HIV infection, concomitant corticosteroid treatment at doses equivalent to prednisone more than 20 mg per day, and anticoagulation with warfarin.\"] For previously treated patients, a 4-week washout period was required. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute institutional review board. All patients provided written informed consent. ',\n"," 'Pretreatment assessments included a complete medical history; physical examination; ECOG performance evaluation; complete blood count; liver and renal function tests; beta2-microglobulin; serum free light chains; viral serologies for HIV and hepatitis B; lymphocyte phenotyping; bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Flow cytometry was used to show that all patients had circulating tumour cells consistent with CLL. Pretreatment lymph node biopsies were obtained in all patients with superficial lymphadenopathy. Interphase FISH was done on peripheral blood or bone marrow in the National Cancer Institute Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory with the Vysis probe (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA); results from accredited external testing facilities were accepted. Sequencing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) was done by LBP in the laboratory of CG (Copenhagen, Denmark). Patients received ibrutinib 420 mg administered orally once daily on a continuous schedule until disease progression or toxicity necessitated drug discontinuation. Each cycle was 28 days (give or take 4 days). Ibrutinib treatment was paused in cases of grade 4 neutropenia lasting for longer than 7 days or any grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Patients who had a first occurrence of grade 3 diarrhoea, constitutional symptoms, or infection were restarted at the same dose when the toxicity resolved to grade 1 severity or less or to baseline. For any other grade 3 adverse event, the dose was reduced by 140 mg. For new-onset or symptomatic atrial fibrillation (grade 2), ibrutinib treatment was paused and a cardiac assessment was done. After resolution of a first occurrence of atrial fibrillation of up to grade 2 severity, the study drug could be restarted at the same dose. Safety monitoring was done every other week for the first month, then monthly until month 6, and every 3 months thereafter. Laboratory tests as part of safety monitoring included complete blood counts, and acute care, hepatic, and mineral panels. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment after six cycles of therapy at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were safety, overall survival, progression-free survival, best response, and nodal response. Data cutoff for study analysis was Aug 1, 2014. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Haematological adverse events were graded according to IWCLL criteria. ',\n"," 'Responses were assessed based on IWCLL 2008 criteria, incorporating the recent updates on partial response with lymphocytosis (appendix p 2). Clinical response was assessed at each visit. At 2, 6, and 12 months, radiological assessments were done. Responses reported here are based on these radiological assessments. Bone marrow evaluation was undertaken in 42 patients at 8 weeks, and in 47 patients at 24 weeks. The bone marrow at 8 weeks was omitted in the first patients and one patient refused bone marrow biopsy at 24 weeks. Bone marrow samples were assessed by immunostaining. FISH for deletion 17p13.1 was repeated on blood samples at 24 weeks. The frequency of deletion 17p13.1 in all CLL cells was calculated as 1 divided by the proportion of CD19+ cells in all lymphocytes multiplied by the proportion of cells with deletion 17p13.1. Spleen volume was calculated from CT scans with the Vitrea Core Workstation Server, version 6.6 (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN, USA). We used a Simon\\'s minimax two-stage design to test the null hypothesis that the proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the study was 15% or lower versus the alternative hypothesis that it was 40% or higher, with a type I error of 0 05 and 90% power.\"] We established that a sample size of 27 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint was needed. Initially, both untreated and relapsed or refractory patients were enrolled. On Aug 24, 2012, the study was amended by the investigators to allow enrolment of an entire cohort of 27 previously untreated patients, in addition to a cohort of 16 patients with relapsed or refractory disease. We enrolled eight additional previously untreated patients to account for the possibility of non-treatment-related discontinuation before 6 months. The safety and survival analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. Objective responses were assessed in patients who were evaluable at 24 weeks. We used descriptive statistics to summarise the findings in each of the defined cohorts, including the primary endpoint. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival (defined as time from study enrolment to death) and progression-free survival (defined as time from study enrolment to progression or death). We estimated the cumulative incidence of progression by considering deaths without relapse as competing risk events. We compared survival probabilities by the log-rank test and cumulative incidence by the Gray\\'s test.\"] R version 3.1.1 was used for statistical analyses.

The study was designed by the investigators, a draft of the protocol was submitted to Pharmacyclics (who provided the study drug) for comments, and all data were collected by the investigators and stored at the National Institutes of Health. The investigators analysed the data and wrote the report. A draft was submitted to Pharmacyclics for comments. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the content of the report and the decision to submit for publication. Between Dec 22, 2011 and Jan 2, 2014, we screened 85 patient records and enrolled 51 eligible patients with CLL, of whom 35 had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease (figure 1, table 1). Most patients had advanced Rai stage and IGHV-unmutated disease (table 1). 47 patients had deletion 17p13.1 identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation in at least 10% of nuclei scored and four patients (two in each cohort) had a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. 35 patients were previously untreated, 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. At the time of analysis, median follow-up for all patients was 24 months (IQR 12 9-27 0). Median follow-up for the previously untreated cohort was 15 months (IQR 12 5-25 7) and for the relapsed or refractory cohort was 26 months (25 4--28 3). 42 (82%) of 51 enrolled patients are still on treatment without disease progression. Nine (18%) of 51 patients discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression in five (10%) patients, and three (6%) deaths. One patient, who was found to have Hodgkin's lymphoma that predated enrolment into the study, was taken off study and is included in the safety analysis only (figure 1, appendix p 1). Progressive disease was caused by Richter's transformation in three patients. An additional two patients had prolymphocytic transformation. Median time to progression for these five patients was 7 5 months (IQR 7 2 - 15 0). \",\n"," 'At 24 weeks 48 patients were evaluable for response (33 previously untreated patients and 15 relapsed/refractory patients). 44 (92%; 95% CI 84 - 100) of these 48 patients achieved an objective response; 24 (50%) had a partial response, and 20 (42%) patients achieved an objective response(95% CI 84-99.5), 24 (50%)a partial response with lymphocytosis (table 2). 32 (97%; 95% CI 86 - 100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response including partial response in 18 (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One previously untreated patient had progressive disease at 0 4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) patients achieved a partial response, six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis, and three patients had stable disease. The proportion of patients achieving an overall response in subgroups based on IGHV mutation status, age, Rai disease stage, beta2-microglobulin, or the presence of bulky lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly was similar (appendix p 3). However, the distribution of partial response and partial response with lymphocyotsis showed some variation (appendix p 3), consistent with different rates of resolution of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis between patients. The rate and depth of response increased with time. Partial response was recorded in six (13%) of 48 patients at 8 weeks and in 24 (50%) at 24 weeks. Conversely, a partial response with lymphocytosis was recorded in 24 (50%) patients at 8 weeks and 20 (42%) patients at 24 weeks. The best response achieved was objective response in 45 (94%; 95% CI 87-100) of all 48 evaluable patients, in 32 (97%; 86-100) of the 33 evaluable patients with previously untreated disease, and in 13 (87%; 69 5-100) of the 15 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Five (10%) of all evaluable patients had a complete response as best response, of whom four had IGHV-unmutated CLL, and all except for one were previously untreated. Median time to complete response was 48 weeks (IQR 48-48). Rapid disease control was achieved in all tissue compartments, reaching at least a 50% mean reduction in tumour burden in both spleen and lymph nodes at 8 weeks, with further improvements on continued therapy (figure 2A, 2B).Responses in the bone marrow seemed to be somewhat slower than in the spleen and lymph nodes. ',\n"," 'At 8 weeks, at least a 50% decrease in tumour burden in the bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen was recorded in 16 (44%) of 36, 31 (70%) of 44, and 30 (79%) of 38 patients with complete data, respectively. At the completion of 24 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in tumour burden in bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen was 34 (83%) of 41, 42 (93%) of 45, and 38 (95%) of 40 patients with complete data, respectively. Reasons for incomplete data include omission of bone marrow biopsies or insufficient material (n=2 at 8 weeks, n=7 at 24 weeks), missing scans (n=2 at 8 weeks, n=1 at 24 weeks), and absence of pathological lymphadenopathy (n=2) or splenomegaly (n=7) at baseline. In three patients, no residual CLL infiltrate was detected in the bone marrow by immunohistochemistry. The quality of tumour response in the tissue sites did not differ by previous treatment history or IGHV mutation status (figure 2C, 2D). The characteristic treatment-induced lymphocytosis was reported in most patients, and the degree and kinetics did not differ in previously untreated patients compared with those with relapsed or refractory disease (figure 2C). By contrast, patients with IGHV-mutated CLL had a greater relative increase and slower resolution of lymphocytosis than did those with IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 2D). Estimated progression-free survival for all patients on an intention-to-treat basis at 24 months was 82% (95% CI 71-94), and overall survival at 24 months was 80% (68-94) (figure 3A, 3B). At final follow-up for this report (Aug 1, 2014), eight (16%) patients had died: five (10%) from progressive disease, two (4%) from infection, and one (2%) patient with sudden unexplained death that was judged to be possibly treatment related (appendix p 1). The estimated overall survival at 24 months was 84% (95% CI 72-100) for previously untreated patients and 74% (57-100) for patients with relapsed or refractory disease (figure 3C); it was 94% (95% CI 84-100) in IGHV-mutated and 71% (53-94) in IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 3D). The cumulative incidence of progression at 24 months was 20% (95% CI 5-44) in patients with relapsed or refractory disease, 9% (1-27) in previously untreated patients (figure 3E), and 20% (7-39) for IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 3F). None of the patients with IGHV-mutated CLL have progressed so far. ',\n"," 'To assess whether or not deletion 17p13.1 confers resistance to ibrutinib, we established the proportion of CLL cells carrying deletion 17p13.1 at baseline and after 24 weeks on treatment. In 43 evaluable patients, the proportion of CLL cells with deletion 17p13.1 decreased in 20 (47%) patients (median decrease 48% [IQR 18 7-82 8%]), increased in 20 (47%) patients (median increase 12% [4 2-43 9%]), and remained unchanged in three (6%) patients (appendix p 4). In the 20 patients with a relative increase in the frequency of deletion 17p13.1, none progressed, 18 (90%) had a clinical response at 24 weeks, and two (10%) patients had stable disease. All of these patients are still continuing in the study on treatment without progression at data cutoff (Aug 1, 2014). Of the four patients who developed progressive disease beyond 24 weeks, two were included in this analysis, in both of whom the proportion of CLL cells with deletion 17p13.1 was decreased compared with baseline at 24 weeks. Treatment with ibrutinib was well tolerated. Most nonhaematological adverse events were of grade 1 or 2 severity (table 3). The most frequent possibly treatmentrelated adverse events were arthralgia, diarrhoea, rash, nail ridging, bruising, and muscle spasms or cramps. The most common non-haematological grade 3 adverse event was pneumonia in three (6%) patients. No grade 3 or worse bleeding events occurred. One patient (2%) required a dose reduction for grade 3 rash. No other adverse events required dose reductions or withdrawal of patients from the study. Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients, anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (table 3). Cytopenias mainly occurred during the first few months on therapy, improved with continuous treatment, and were not associated with infections or bleeding. TP53 aberrations identify a high-risk group of patients with CLL for whom no standard treatment exists. Responses to front-line chemoimmunotherapy are short lived. Ibrutinib has shown activity in relapsed and refractory patients including in those with deletion 17p13.1. We report mature results from a phase 2 trial of single-agent ibrutinib for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations including:to the best of our knowledge:the largest experience in previously untreated patients receiving this targeted agent as first-line therapy (panel). Ibrutinib induced responses in 32 (97%) of the 33 evaluable, previously untreated patients; the estimated rate of progression was 9% (95% CI 1a$\"27) at 24 months. ',\n"," \"This finding contrasts with responses in around 68% of patients and median progression-free survival of less than 12 months when first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab are used to treat these high-risk patients. Our study includes 35 patients with TP53 aberrations receiving ibrutinib as first-line therapy:a number that is similar to the combined 30 previously untreated patients with deletion 17p13.1 who were treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in the two largest studies done so far. Another non-chemotherapy based regimen active in CLL with TP53 aberrations is alemtuzumab with methylprednisolone, which in first line achieved a response in 88% of patients and a median progression-free survival of 18 3 months (95% CI 15 6-not available). Longer follow-up with ibrutinib is needed to better assess durability of response and the possible need for subsequent treatment. Safety and tolerability of treatment with ibrutinib was favourable and similar to findings reported in other studies. Only one patient needed a dose reduction and no patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. In the phase 1b-2 study of single-agent ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory CLL, the estimated progression-free survival at 26 months for patients with deletion 17p13.1 was 57%, but more than 90% for patients without deletion 17p13.1 or 11q22.3. We therefore sought to investigate whether deletion 17p13.1 confers resistance to ibrutinib that would lead to relapse as reported with chemoimmunotherapy. However, sequential FISH analysis provided no evidence for the selection of resistant subclones with deletion 17p13.1 during ibrutinib therapy, which supports a probably P53-independent mechanism of action. The type of response that occurred with ibrutinib differs from that achieved with chemoimmunotherapy. Deep remissions, at least during the first year on therapy, were rare, even in previously untreated patients. However, as we and others have previously reported, residual disease that persists during ibrutinib therapy consists mostly of quiescent cells with a low proliferative rate. Consistently, the presence of residual disease does not seem to predict treatment failure, by contrast with the experience with chemoimmunotherapy. Disease progression on treatment was reported in only five (10%) patients and occurred at a median of 7 5 months (IQR 7 2-15 0). Notably, all five patients had transformation, which manifested as Richter's syndrome in three patients and as prolymphocytic transformation in two. In retrospect, transformation might have already been present at study entry in two patients (appendix p 1). \",\n"," 'In addition to TP53 aberrations, all the patients who progressed had additional high-risk disease features at baseline: all had IGHV-unmutated CLL, two had MYC amplification (a rare ultra-high-risk event in CLL), and three had been heavily pretreated. Recently, Richter\\'s transformation was reported in 23% of patients with deletion 17p13.1 after a median of 12 months from first-line therapy, mainly with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Thus, the rate of transformation on ibrutinib seems to be lower than reported with other frequently used first-line therapies for high-risk patients. However, additional follow-up will be needed to better assess the long-term transformation rate in patients treated with ibrutinib. Tumour microenvironment interactions and B-cell receptor signalling are pivotal pathogenic pathways in CLL and are targets for new therapeutic approaches. The substantial reduction in disease burden and the notable reduction in intracellular signalling, cellular activation, and proliferation throughout the different anatomical compartments is consistent with the role of BTK as a central node in many signalling pathways. Recently, acquired mutations in BTK and PLCg2 that confer resistance to ibrutinib have been reported. However, the low frequency of these mutations suggests that tumour cells cannot easily bypass the block in intracellular signalling imposed by ibrutinib. In conclusion, single-agent ibrutinib induced durable responses in CLL with TP53 aberrations. Treatment failure in previously untreated patients was rare. Subclones with deletion 17p13.1 were equally sensitive to ibrutinib as were those not carrying the deletion, which is consistent with a P53-independent mechanism of action of the drug. The quality and duration of response might be improved further with combination therapy. These data support the use of ibrutinib as first-line therapy of CLL with TP53 aberrations. Longer follow-up will be needed to assess the effect of this targeted agent on long-term survival, which will clarify whether or not ibrutinib could eventually replace allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for these high-risk patients. We designed this study in 2011 to investigate novel treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations. Although chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab was firmly established as an effective regimen for most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), patients with TP53 aberrations had poor outcomes. We searched PubMed for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2006, and June, 2011 for treatment options in CLL with TP53 aberrations or deletion 17p13.1, using the search terms \"chronic lymphocytic leukemia\", \"TP53\", \"deletion 17p\", \"alemtuzumab\", \"flavopiridol\", and \"lenalidomide\". ',\n"," 'In particular, alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, and flavopiridol, were shown to have activity in at least a subset of these high-risk patients (summarised by Badoux and colleagues). However, responses to these agents were often short lived. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was known to provide long-term disease control and consensus guidelines recommend this transplantation approach in first remission for patients with CLL and deletion 17p13.1. Early data about ibrutinib presented at scientific meetings suggested it had good activity in CLL, irrespective of whether or not classical high-risk disease features were present. Several studies have now established ibrutinib as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for relapsed or refractory patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations. Ibrutinib is now approved in both the USA and Europe for patients with relapsed disease and as first-line therapy for CLL with deletion 17p13.1 (USA and EU) or TP53 aberrations (EU). Our study provides mature data for the largest cohort so far of such high-risk patients receiving ibrutinib as first-line therapy. Although progressive disease manifested as transformation in 10% of patients on this study, the rate of transformation on ibrutinib seems to be lower than previously reported with first-line chemoimmunotherapy. With the advent of active targeted agents such as ibrutinib, chemoimmunotherapy for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations should be avoided. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

Circulating CD52 (cCD52) and CD20 (cCD20) have prognostic utility in lymphoid malignancies. The efficacy of mAb therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) may be adversely affected by cCD52 or cCD20. In this report, blood and bone marrow (BM) cCD52 and cCD20 were measured at response assessment in previously treated (N = 235) patients with CLL who received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). Univariate and multivariate statistical models evaluated correlations of pre- and response variables with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Response variables included 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) response, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) in BM, and cCD52 and cCD20 levels (blood and BM) at response assessment. Using multivariate analysis, response blood and BM cCD52, blood cCD20, and NCI-WG response were significant independent predictors of PFS. At the time of response assessment, BM cCD52 correlated with OS in univariate analysis. cCD52 and cCD20, therefore appear useful in predicting survival and may be important for monitoring patients following salvage FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) therapy. These data further indicate that plasma may be a good target to evaluate for minimal residual disease using cCD52/cCD20 levels. The clinical course for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is varied, with some patients having smouldering, asymptomatic disease and others having rapid progression. Identifying prognostic markers and factors that may be useful in guiding management and follow-up are important for patients with CLL. Prognostic factors that are being studied as potentially important predictors of clinical endpoints, such as time to treatment, response to treatment, remission duration, and overall survival (OS), include IGHV mutation status; expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 by leukaemia cells; plasma levels of beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) and circulating CD23; and presence of chromosome abnormalities, such as 17p deletion and 11q deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. These factors were initially studied in selected patient populations in retrospective analyses. True appreciation of the utility and importance of each factor will come with prospective analyses in unselected patients. Some of these factors are static and do not change through the clinical course, and others may change, such as acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (clonal evolution). Less is known about the importance of these prognostic factors in previously treated patients. ',\n"," 'Chemoimmunotherapy, specifically the combination of anti-CD20 (rituximab) and/or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapeutic agents, has shown impressive efficacy in the treatment of CLL in frontline and salvage settings. CD20 is an integral membrane protein expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes and may play a role in proliferation, differentiation, and regulation of B lymphocyte activities. Although it has four transmembrane-spanning regions, and therefore is highly membrane embedded, high levels of circulating CD20 (cCD20) have been detected in plasma samples from patients with CLL, and have been correlated with advanced stage CLL and shorter survival. This cCD20 probably represents membrane fragments in plasma from apoptotic cells that result from cell turnover, rather than specifically shed protein. In vitro studies have shown that cCD20 can interfere with rituximab binding to CLL cells; therefore, high cCD20 levels may act as an in vivo sump, altering rituximab pharmacokinetics and minimizing the clinical response to rituximab. The amount of circulating CD52 (cCD52) has prognostic value in patients with CLL. CD52 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell protein expressed on the surface of haematopoietic cells, including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. CD52 is also expressed on neoplastic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin. cCD52 was detected at higher levels in patients with CLL, compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, low levels of cCD52 were correlated with less aggressive disease, higher complete response (CR) rates following treatment and longer survival in patients with CLL. In contrast to CD20, and in view of its GPI linkage, CD52 is thought to be actively shed from the surface of lymphocytes. cCD52 may also be detected as membrane fragments produced by apoptosis and cell turnover. cCD52 may interfere with alemtuzumab binding to CLL cells, and lower levels of cCD52 have been correlated with increased response to alemtuzumab. There is a clear correlation between the response to treatment by 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria and the progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for patients with CLL. One of the potential shortcomings of the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria is that residual disease is identified by microscopic examination of blood and bone marrow, which does not address residual disease in others sites, such as lymph node and spleen. New assays to evaluate response and predict for PFS and OS potentially could therefore be used in conjunction with 1996 NCI-WG response criteria to better predict these important clinical outcomes. ',\n"," \"with 1996 NCI-WG response criteria to better predict these important clinical outcomes. We evaluated the prognostic value of cCD20 and cCD52 in peripheral blood and BM at the time of response assessment from 235 previously treated patients who received the three-drug combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Additionally, we evaluated the pre-treatment characteristics, which may be helpful in predicting PFS and OS following FCR therapy in patients with CLL. Patients in this analysis included 177 patients from a previously published study investigating the efficacy of FCR in the salvage setting for whom we had cryopreserved samples, and 58 additional patients. All patients provided informed consent according to U.T. MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional guidelines. Briefly, 235 previously treated patients with CLL were enrolled on a phase II clinical trial starting in November, 1999. Pre-treatment evaluation included history, physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, platelet (PLT) count, liver and kidney function tests, beta2M, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and BM aspiration with immunophenotyping and BM biopsy. Refractoriness to fludarabine or alkylating agents was defined as failure to achieve at least partial remission (PR) with the last agent-based treatment or progression within 6 months of treatment. Patients were to receive up to six courses of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, each daily for 3 d, and a single dose of rituximab 375 mg/m2, course 1 and 500 mg/m2 courses 2-6. Each course was 4 weeks as permitted by recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts. Response to treatment and progression were evaluated by the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria. CR required resolution of all palpable disease, normalization of blood counts and no evidence of disease in BM biopsy. Nodular partial remission (nPR) required the same criteria as for CR except that one or more lymphoid nodules or aggregates were present on bone marrow biopsy. PR criteria included at least 50% reduction in measurable disease and one or more of the following features: neutrophil count > 1 5 x 109/l or a 50% improvement over baseline, platelets >= 100 x 109/l or a 50% improvement over baseline, and haemoglobin >= 110 g/l or a 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions. Imaging studies (i.e. computed tomography scans) were not required to evaluate response. The response must have persisted for more than 2 months. Patients' BM was also evaluated by 2-colour flow cytometry for presence of CD5/19+ cells as a measure of residual disease. \",\n"," 'Blood and/or bone marrow (BM) samples for cCD20 and cCD52 evaluation were obtained pre-treatment in a limited number of patients, and at specific time points following treatment in greater proportion. Samples at the following time points from start of treatment were available for BM cCD20 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 50), 3 months (n = 29), 6 months (time of response assessment) (n = 66), 12 months (n = 71), 18 months (n = 49), 24 months (n = 48), and 36 months (n = 38); BM cCD52 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 50), 3 months (n = 29), 6 months (n = 67), 12 months (n = 71), 18 months (n = 49), 24 months (n = 48), and 36 months (n = 38); blood cCD20 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 27), 3 months (n = 22), 6 months (n = 61), 12 months (n = 68), 18 months (n = 46), 24 months (n = 54), and 36 months (n = 41); and blood cCD52 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 27), 3 months (n = 21), 6 months (n = 62), 12 months (n = 68), 18 months (n = 47), 24 months (n = 53), and 36 months (n = 42). To reduce the possibility that the clotting process may damage circulating cells and influence the levels of cCD20, plasma, rather than serum, was used for measuring cCD20 and cCD52 in blood. Anti-coagulated BM samples were centrifuged to obtain the non-cellular fluid phase used to measure BM cCD52 and cCD20. Despite the precautions taken during BM sample collection, dilution of BM samples by blood cannot be fully excluded. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to detect plasma cCD20 and cCD52 levels as previously described. Briefly, the sample was added to a 96-well polystyrene plate coated with anti-CD20 or anti-CD52, and incubated for 3 h with constant shaking at room temperature. Subsequently, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated for 3 h with 20 mul of humanized anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:400 in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0 1% Tween 20. Following six more washes with PBS-T, 100 mul of colorimetric substrate was added to the wells and plates were then incubated with constant shaking for 15-30 min. ',\n"," \"Following the addition of 50 mul of 2 N HCl to quench the reaction, the plates were read at a wavelength of 450 nm. Assessment of IGHV for MRD was performed as previously described. PCR was performed on DNA samples from blood and BM cells using 5' fluorescently end-labelled consensus primers for the rearranged IGH CDRIII region, FR3A [5'-ACACGGC(C/T)(G/C) TGTATTACTGT-3'] and VLJH (5'-GTGACCAGGGTNCCTTGGCCCCAG-3'). PCR products were resolved on 3100 genetic analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and peak areas and heights were determined by Genescan analysis software (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescently-tagged PCR amplification products were subsequently digested with the restriction enzyme HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA, USA). Resulting fragments were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel, and then isolated using gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). Ligase chain reaction (LCR) using Taq DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) was subsequently performed on patient's PCR amplified DNA, and products were resolved on the ABI 3100 under similar conditions described for the PCR assay. The ratio of the peak areas of VLJH to K-RAS (internal control) was reported as positive (ratio > 0 2), low positive (ratio < 0 2), or negative (ratio = 0). This ligase-based assay was reported to have similar sensitivity to allele-specific PCR. Patient characteristics were summarized using median (range) for numerical variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. OS time was defined as the time interval from enrollment on protocol (or start of therapy) to death or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time interval from enrollment on protocol to progression (1996 NCI-WG criteria), death or last follow-up. Both cCD20 and cCD52 were treated as continuous variables in Cox regression analyses. OS or PFS probabilities were estimated by Kaplan and Meier analyses. The differences in OS or PFS among subgroups of patients were evaluated using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the ability of patient characteristics to predict OS or PFS, with goodness-of-fit assessed by the Grambsch-Therneau test, Schoenfeld residual plots, and martingale residual plots. Predictive variables were transformed as appropriate based on these plots. CART (Categorization and Regression Tree) analysis was used to search for the optimal cutoff values for covariates. Tables I and II contain the full list of variables that were assessed in the univariate Cox models. Only variables with P-value <= 0 05 in the univariate fit were considered for the multivariate models. \",\n"," 'A multivariate Cox model was developed for OS and PFS by performing a backward elimination with P-value cutoff of 0 05, then allowing any variable previously deleted to enter the final model if its P-value was <0 05. Of note, we did not include pre- and post-treatment variables in the same multivariate analyses. Natural logarithmic (Ln)-transformation was used for some variables to minimize skewing of data points. All computations were carried out in S-Plus. Pre-treatment patient characteristics are presented in Table I. Routine blood studies, included blood counts and chemistries, physical examination findings and BM biopsy were evaluated at study entry. Seventy percent of patients were male, Rai stages were well represented, and most patients had a performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. Seventy percent of patients had received <= 2 prior treatments, and 25% and 17% were considered refractory to alkylating agents and fludarabine respectively. Significant differences were noted between BM (median = 100 nmol/l) and peripheral blood cCD20 (median = 257 nmol/l) (P = 0 02, Wilcoxn rank-sum test) as well as peripheral blood cCD20 and cCD52 (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0 54; P-value < 0 001). The majority (63%) of patients completed >= 4 courses of FCR. Responses to treatment are shown in Table II. CR and PR rates were both 30%; nodular PR was seen in 15% of patients. Measures of residual disease, in addition to 1996 NCI-WG response criteria, were used to evaluate patients. Two-colour flow cytometry evaluation of the BM for CD5/CD19 at response assessment or 2 months following the last cycle of FCR for those that did not receive 6 cycles, and PCR for IGHV yielded similar frequencies of patients with MRD (25% vs. 23% respectively). Distribution of cCD20 and cCD52 levels is shown in Table III. The majority of patients had cCD20 and cCD52 values available at the time of response assessment; however, too few patients had pre-treatment values to perform meaningful analyses. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment. The 1st and 3rd quartile values are shown to demonstrate the distribution of cCD20 and cCD52 measurements used in these analyses (Table III). ',\n"," 'For a given patient, there was a significant difference between the BM and blood cCD20 at the time of response assessment (P = 0 02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), but no significant differences were noted for BM and blood cCD52 at the time of response assessment (P = 0 72, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additionally, to determine the correlation between number of FCR cycles and blood cCD20 and cCD52 levels, patients were grouped into 3 categories based on the number of FCR cycles received: (i) <=3 cycles; (ii) 4 or 5 cycles; and (iii) >=6 cycles. There was a significant association between blood cCD20 at the time of response assessment and the number of FCR cycles (P-value = 0 04; Kruskal-Wallis test), but no significant association between blood CD52 at 6 months and the number of FCR cycles (P-value = 0 95; Kruskal-Wallis test). At the time of these analyses, the median follow up time was 75 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 72-81]. One hundred and seventeen patients (66%) of 177 responders (CR, nPR, or PR) have relapsed and the median time to progression was 29 months (95% CI = 27-38 months). Of the 233 patients analysed, 146 patients (63%) have died and the median survival time was 47 months (95% CI = 41-58 months). We determined cutoff values for BM CD52 and CD20, as well as blood CD52 and CD20, and correlated these values with PFS (Fig 1). Cutoff values for BM CD52, BM CD20, blood CD52 and blood CD20 at response assessment were 10, 5, 28 and 179 nmol/l respectively. The cutoff values for cCD20 or cCD52 were chosen using CART (classification and regression tree) analysis, which gives a more robust analysis compared to using median values or quartiles, the latter limited by the small number of patients for whom we had measured values at the indicated quartiles. PFS was significantly longer in patients with lower CD20 and CD52 levels in BM and blood at end of treatment (Fig 1). Although BM CD20 was significant in univariate analysis, it did not achieve statistical significance in the multivariate model. The use of rituximab in the treatment of all patients in this study may have affected the measurement of CD20 and therefore the outcomes of the analysis. ',\n"," 'Survival was correlated with 1996 NCI-WG response status; those who achieved a CR had the longest PFS, while patients with PR had the shorter PFS (data not shown). Similarly, a significantly longer OS was noted in patients who achieved CR/nPR, compared with those who achieved PR. Patients who did not respond to treatment [non-responder/early death (NR/ED)] had the shortest OS (data not shown). Univariate analyses showed the following pretreatment characteristics to be correlated with shorter PFS: advanced age (relative risk (RR) = 1 020; P = 0 02), elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 1 808; P = 0 008) and elevated LDH (RR = 1 733; P = 0 05); smaller spleen size was correlated with longer PFS (RR = 0 948; P = 0 04). Table IVA shows factors evaluated at end of treatment that correlated with longer PFS, namely lower cCD20 and cCD52 in blood and bone marrow and lower level of residual disease by two-colour flow cytometry for CD5/CD19+ cells and PCR for IGHV in bone marrow. Univariate analyses for pretreatment characteristics that correlated with shorter OS were advanced age (RR = 1 035; P <= 0 001); advanced Rai stage (high-risk) (RR = 1 8; P < 0 001); low haemoglobin (RR = 0 86; P <= 0 001); low albumin (RR = 0 62; P = 0 006); elevated alk phos (RR = 1 006; P = 0 03); elevated creatinine (ln Cr) (RR = 2 201; P = 0 03); elevated LDH (RR = 1 87; P = 0 002); elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 2 67; P <= 0 001); more than one prior treatment (RR = 1 47; P = 0 03); and refractoriness to alkylating agents (RR = 1 67; P = 0 007). Table IVB shows factors evaluated at end of treatment that correlated with longer PFS, namely lower cCD52 in bone marrow and lower level of residual disease by two-colour flow cytometry for CD5/CD19+ cells and PCR for IGHV in bone marrow. Multivariate analysis of pre- and post-treatment variables evaluated separately demonstrated that elevated beta2M and splenomegaly were independently associated with shorter PFS (Table V). Shorter PFS was independently associated with an inferior response to treatment (NCI-WG criteria), higher blood cCD20 and cCD52 at end of treatment and higher BM cCD52 at end of treatment (Table V). ',\n"," 'Elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 2 46; P < 0 001), lower albumin level (RR = 0 66; P = 0 05) and refractoriness to alkylating agents (RR = 1 68; P = 0 009) were significant independent pre-treatment predictors for shorter OS in multivariate analysis. The strongest post-treatment predictor for a shorter OS was achievement of PR/NR/ED (versus CR/nPR-1996 NCI-WG response status) (RR = 4 70; P < 0 0001). Neither cCD52 nor cCD20 added to this multivariate model. The lack of association of cCD52 and cCD20 with OS may be attributed to that fact that many patients received subsequent salvage therapy, which can impact survival. cCD20 and cCD52 appear to be important biological markers in CLL. We have previously analysed patient characteristics in this cohort of patients that predict for survival; however, the data presented in this study demonstrate for the first time that cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment are predictors for post-treatment survival (PFS or OS) in CLL patients treated with FCR. Most notably, BM and blood cCD52 as well as blood cCD20 at response assessment were independent predictors for PFS in patients treated with FCR. Although our data seem to validate previously reported pre-treatment clinical and laboratory parameters as being significant prognostic factors for patients with CLL, this is the first report to describe that cCD20 and cCD52 at response assessment are important predictors of disease outcomes in CLL. Prior reports demonstrated the prognostic significance of both cCD20 and cCD52 in patients with lymphoid malignancies. showed that cCD52 was detectable at baseline in plasma from patients with CLL and that higher levels significantly correlated with advanced Rai stage, higher beta2M, immunoglobulin mutation status, and worse survival. Similarly, higher baseline cCD20 levels in plasma were shown to correlate positively with beta2M, leukaemia cell expression of CD38, advanced stage disease (Rai and Binet), and significantly shorter survival. In patients with non-Hodgkin (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma, pre- and post-treatment levels of serum cCD52 had no predictive value for survival, while post- treatment serum cCD20 levels were highly correlated with survival in NHL patients. Our results further extend these findings, specifically highlighting the prognostic value of cCD20 and cCD52 at the time of response assessment following therapy with FCR in previously treated patients. ',\n"," \"Unlike the aforementioned report examining post-treatment cCD20 and cCD52 levels, where patients were treated with various regimens not including rituximab or alemtuzumab, all patients included in our study were treated uniformly with FCR. Furthermore, we did not use previously reported cutoff values for cCD20 and cCD52 in our analyses but examined values at the time of response assessment and general trends over time. In fact, the median values measured in our studies for cCD52 and cCD20 were much lower than those previously reported (1875 nmol/l and 2336 nmol/l for cCD20 and cCD52 respectively); this is probably secondary to our reported values representing post-treatment cCD20 and cCD52. Previously well-documented prognostic factors including age, haemoglobin, beta2M, and NCI-WG response status were confirmed in our analyses. Although BM samples may be more difficult to obtain in clinical practice, BM values are part of the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria, and therefore BM cCD20 and cCD52 were included in our study. cCD20 and cCD52 levels were correlated with PFS in multivariate analysis (Table V). Continued follow up may demonstrate that cCD20 and cCD52 are important prognostic factors for OS, even though they were not significantly correlated with OS in this analysis. In addition to cCD20 and cCD52, our results also showed PCR for IGHV to be a significant prognostic factor in previously treated patients, with higher levels correlated with shorter survival. Detection of IGHV is a sensitive marker of residual disease, and may signify failure of FCR to fully eradicate the malignant clones. Nevertheless, when used simultaneously with cCD52 and cCD20 in the multivariate analysis models (Table V), IGHV lost its significance as a predictor of PFS (versus cCD20 or cCD52), thereby indicating that, in comparison with IGHV, cCD20 and cCD52 may be better prognostic factors for PFS. In addition to PFS and OS, we also analysed the association of CD5/CD19, cCD20 and cCD52 levels with MRD. There was a significant association between CD5/CD19 level (categorized as low, intermediate and high) and PCR for MRD (P = 0 0002, Fisher's exact test) as well as a significant association between blood (P = 0 03, Kruskal-Wallis test) and BM (P = 0 006, Kruskal-Wallis test) cCD52 at response assessment and PCR for MRD (data not shown). \",\n"," 'There were no significant associations between PCR for MRD and blood (P = 0 65, Kruskal-Wallis test) and BM (P = 0 56, Kruskal-Wallis test) cCD20 levels at response assessment (data not shown). We are prospectively studying the role of CD20 and CD52 in the detection of MRD, in comparison with the more standard approaches, which include four-colour flow cytometry (CD5, CD19, CD43 and CD20) and allele-specific PCR. In summary, cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment had prognostic value in previously treated patients receiving FCR and potentially other treatment regimens. Elevated cCD20 or cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment following treatment with FCR indicate higher likelihood for relapse or shorter survival; in such cases additional treatment may be warranted.

',\n"," 'Alemtuzumab is highly effective at treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in bone marrow, which is the usual site of residual disease after fludarabine-based treatment. Eliminating residual disease potentially is associated with longer remission and overall survival. The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease. Patients in partial remission (PR), nodular PR (nPR), or complete remission (CR) who had disease in bone marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks, and patients had the option to self-administer alemtuzumab. Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR, patients in nPR who converted to a CR, and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment. There were 31 patients enrolled, of whom 29 were evaluable, and there were 23 responders (4 of 4 patients who achieved a CR, 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR, and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR. Non-responders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment. Furthermore, higher plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration. Compared with the results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was a trend toward a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab. The current results demonstrated that self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to monitor in future alemtuzumab consolidation trials. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who achieve complete remission (CR) or nodular partial remission (nPR) according to 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria have longer remission duration and survival than patients who achieve partial remission (PR) or who fail to respond to treatment. Molecular analysis for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene and 4-color flow cytometry analysis are more sensitive than morphologic evaluation of the bone marrow used to establish CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. A study by Moreton et al of alemtuzumab administered to previously treated patients with CLL demonstrated that those who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-free status according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis had longer survival. This suggested that evaluating for MDR-free status could add to response evaluation. ',\n"," 'Studies in fludarabine-refractory, previously treated, and treatment-naive patients with CLL clearly demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous alemtuzumab. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab is effective in fludarabine-refractory patients and as initial treatment for patients with CLL. Previously, we reported results from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of alemtuzumab intravenously 3 times weekly for 4 to 8 weeks in eliminating residual disease after treatment with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. That study demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% in 41 patients; the median response duration was not reached at a median follow-up of 18 months. Here, we report the results with subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease and include a retrospective evaluation of bone marrow for MRD by 4-color flow cytometry analysis and end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels. Furthermore, we compare outcomes between the subcutaneous alemtuzumab group and an updated historic group of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab. This was a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the CLL Research Consortium. Patients were enrolled from March 2005 to May 2007, including 16 patients at The University of Texas M. Anderson Cancer Center, 11 patients at University of California-San Diego, and 4 patients at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. All respective institutional review boards approved the protocol and the informed consent form. All participants provided informed consent according to institutional guidelines. Patients with CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia were aged >18 years, had a performance status between 0 and 2, had adequate liver and kidney function (creatinine, total bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels all <=2 times the upper limit of normal), and achieved CR, nPR, or PR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria with their most recent treatment. Patients in CR were required to have a residual population of cluster of differentiation 5 (CD5)-positive/CD19-positive cells that comprised >=10% of the bone marrow mononuclear population or CD5-positive/CD19-positive cells that comprised <10% of the bone marrow mononuclear population with a kappa/lambda ratio of >6 or <0.33, respectively. Patients were excluded for active infection, history of anaphylaxis with rodent-derived monoclonal antibodies, prior treatment with alemtuzumab, pregnancy, corticosteroids, and uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Patients could not have received treatment for CLL within 2 months of enrollment; there was no upper limit for the time from last chemotherapy. The trial intended to enroll 25 patients in nPR or PR and 25 patients in CR. ',\n"," 'accrue and, as a result, was closed. The current analysis includes 26 patients who were enrolled in the nPR/PR group and 5 patients who were enrolled in the CR group. Patients were registered in the CLL Research Consortium database, and all data were collected through the web-based clinical database system. Upon enrollment, patients underwent complete history and physical examination, pretreatment laboratory evaluation (including blood chemistries and blood count), and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Some patients had prognostic factors evaluated, including IGHV mutation status and leukemia cell expression of zeta chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) and CD38 (in respective clinical laboratories), by flow cytometry. Treatment consisted of single-agent, subcutaneous alemtuzumab at doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on Days 1, 2, and 3, respectively, followed by 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for a total of 12 doses, including the initial dose escalation. The research nurses with previously prepared educational materials taught patients self-administration. Once patients demonstrated self-administration to the staff, this was continued for the duration of treatment. Dosing, injection site, and toxicities were documented by patients with diaries, which were submitted for review and documentation at the end of treatment. Premedications consisted of 25 mg to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 650 mg oral acetaminophen. In addition, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily, 3 times weekly, or he equivalent for Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis and valacyclovir 500 mg daily or valganciclovir 450 mg twice daily for viral prophylaxis were given for the duration of treatment and for a minimum of 3 months after completing alemtuzumab. Responses to treatment were assessed within 4 weeks of the end of treatment, and patients could receive a second 4-week course if residual disease was documented at their first response assessment. Criteria for response were as follows: Patients who enrolled in CR were considered responders if they had no disease detected on 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analyses after treatment; specifically, 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analysis could not demonstrate any kappa:lambda skewing (3:1 or 1:3) regardless of the proportion of cells that coexpressed CD5 and CD19. For patients who enrolled in nPR, responders must have achieved CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who enrolled in PR, responders must have achieved either nPR or CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab, response was assessed after the second course. ',\n"," 'Patients had a physician visit at least every 3 months after response assessment and underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at least every 6 months to evaluate for loss of response. Time to loss of response and survival were dated from study enrollment. Loss of response was defined for patients who enrolled in CR as the loss of 2-color flow cytometry response in bone marrow, or developing nodules, or >=30% lymphocytes in bone marrow, or lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly; for patients who enrolled in nPR, loss of response was defined as redeveloping criteria for nPR or for PR; and, for patients who enrolled in PR, loss of response was defined as redeveloping criteria for PR. Plasma alemtuzumab levels were assessed retrospectively at the end of treatment using the flow cytometry-based method developed by Rebello and Hale. Bone marrow samples that were cryopreserved at response assessment were evaluated retrospectively for MRD by standardized 4-color flow cytometry (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, Mass). Patients also were evaluated for antialemtuzumab antibodies (BioAnalab Limited, Oxford Science Park, United Kingdom), and none were positive after treatment (data not shown). We previously conducted a trial of intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease that enrolled 41 patients. The trial was revised to enroll an additional 17 patients among CLL Research Consortium clinical sites. We updated follow-up of all 58 patients to include response duration and survival (Table 1). This group was used as an historic intravenous alemtuzumab comparison group. Associations between categorical patient characteristics were evaluated with the Fisher exact test. Comparisons of measured data between the subcutaneous cohort and the intravenous cohort, as well as comparisons between responders and nonresponders, used either the 2-sample t test or its nonparametric alternative, the Wilcoxon ranksum test. The distribution of time to loss of response and survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier curves for categorical variables were plotted for recurrence-free survival. The P values for testing differences between subgroups/levels for each variable were calculated by using log-rank tests. Time intervals were measured from the first day of treatment until progression, recurrence, or death; and deaths from all causes were included. There were 31 patients enrolled who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab, including 17 patients in PR, 9 patients in nPR, and 5 patients in CR (Table 1). ',\n"," 'The median age was 65 years (range, 48-84 years), the median number of previous treatments was 1 (range, 1-6 previous treatments), and the time from last treatment to alemtuzumab was 7.6 months (range, 2-45 months). All patients who had previously received a fludarabine-based regimen were at least 4 months from treatment (data not shown). Enrollment status according to the last treatment regimen and response to that regimen are shown in Table 2. The ORR was 74% (90% exact binomial confidence interval, 58%-86%). Seven patients received a second alemtuzumab course (Table 3). There was 1 death (a patient in PR) that occurred within 1 month of the last alemtuzumab dose because of refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and 1 patient was lost to followup (a patient in CR); neither patient could be evaluated for response, and both were included in the denominator for ORR. All 4 evaluable patients who enrolled in CR were responders to subcutaneous alemtuzumab according to specified criteria (Table 4). Eight of 9 patients who enrolled in nPR and 11 of 17 patients who enrolled in PR responded to subcutaneous alemtuzumab treatment. Four-color flow cytometry analysis was performed retrospectively on cryopreserved bone marrow samples that were obtained at response assessment for 22 of the evaluable patients (Table 4). Two of 4 patients who enrolled in CR had post-treatment bone marrow MR Devaluations, and neither was MRD-negative at end of treatment. Twenty-nine percent of 7 patients who enrolled in nPR and 18% of 13 patients who enrolled in PR were MRD-negative according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis at response assessment. Alemtuzumab therapy was highly effective at eliminating morphologic evidence of residual disease from blood and bone marrow and was less effective at treating residual lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1). The median plasma alemtuzumab concentration at the end of treatment was significantly higher (P = .003) for responders (n = 19; mean concentration, 9.3 microg/mL) than for nonresponders (n = 6; mean concentration, 0.1 microg/mL) (Fig. 2). Among the responders who were evaluated, the end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab concentration was correlated with response duration (Fig. 3A). The overall median plasma level was 6 microg/mL. Significantly longer response duration was observed for responders who had alemtuzumab levels above the median (P = .05). ',\n"," 'The mean alemtuzumab plasma concentration at the end of treatment for the 19 patients who received 1 course of alemtuzumab was 7.7 +- 4.7 microg/mL compared with 2.6 +- 3.8 microg/mL for the 6 patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab. The response rate for the 6 patients who received 2 courses was 50% versus 84% for the 19 patients who received 1 course of subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Responses were evaluated according to pretreatment prognostic factor status, and none of the factors correlated with response or response duration, possibly because of the small patient numbers (Table 5). The median followup is 31 months, and the median response duration is 13 months. Five patients have died, including 1 patient with refractory AIHA, as mentioned above, and 4 patients during follow-up 27 to 31 months after treatment on this study, all with progressive, refractory CLL. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 6). Patients were able to self-administer alemtuzumab without complication or difficulties, as documented by their diaries. Injection site reactions (grade 1 or 2), consisting of erythema, pruritus, and induration that typically lasted 2 or 3 days with complete resolution, were reported by 24 patients (most were grade 1). Four patients experienced serious infections associated with neutropenia; 2 patients developed pneumonia, 1 patient developed gram-positive bacteremia, and 1 patient developed fever of unknown origin. All serious infections occurred within 2 months of completing alemtuzumab and were not associated with plasma alemtuzumab levels greater than the median (6 microg/mL) at the end of treatment. Two patients developed symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation that required ganciclovir treatment, and 1 patient developed a fever and was treated empirically for presumed CMV reactivation. Hematologic toxicities consisted of neutropenia, which was grade 3 in 19% of patients and grade 4 in 19% of patients. Grade 3 anemia was noted in 3% of patients, and no grade >=3 thrombocytopenia was observed. These hematologic toxicities were attributed to treatment with alemtuzumab and were not associated with increased end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels (Table 6). There were 4 serious adverse events, all of which occurred at the end of alemtuzumab treatment or within 1 month of completion. One patient developed uncontrolled hemolytic anemia during treatment and died (Table 6), as mentioned above. One patient developed neutropenic fever and was admitted to the hospital; blood cultures grew Staphylococcus hominis, and the infection was treated and resolved. ',\n"," 'One patient was admitted and treated with empiric antibiotics for neutropenic fever. Radiographs revealed no source of infection, and cultures remained negative; the fever resolved with antibiotics (Table 6). The same patient experienced a second event of pneumonia with an infiltrate observed on a chest x-ray in the setting of neutropenia that was treated and resolved. There were no reported late infections or infection-related deaths. Response and response duration, as defined for the subcutaneous population, for 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease was updated (Table 1). The characteristics of this group were similar to those of the 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab with the after noted differences: The intravenous group received fewer courses of alemtuzumab, was younger, had lower platelet count, and had higher beta-2 microglobulin levels at enrollment (Table 1). The proportion of patients with lymphadenopathy before alemtuzumab was similar between the groups (Table 1). Among the patients who had lymphadenopathy, 60% of those in the subcutaneous group and 52% of those in the intravenous group had more than 1 involved lymph node site. Furthermore, the largest lymph node measured >=2 cm in 50% of those in the subcutaneous group and in 31% of those in the intravenous group. The ORR using the same criteria was lower (P = .07) for the patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab (Table 1). However, among the responders, the proportion of patients who had MRD-negative bone marrow status was significantly higher (P = .005) in the intravenous group, although the method used to evaluate MRD differed between trials; 4-color flow cytometry analysis was used in the subcutaneous trial, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for the clonal IGHV gene was used in the intravenous trial. There was a trend (P = .07) for shorter response duration, when using the same criteria for both trials, for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab (median response duration, 13 months vs 31 months, respectively) (Fig. 3B). There was no difference in overall survival between the trials at the most recent follow-up (data not shown). Investigators have evaluated strategies to achieve MRD-free status by incorporating alemtuzumab into the approach with the expectation that this may translate into longer remission duration and survival. The phase 3 trial of the German CLL Study Group clearly demonstrated longer progression-free survival for patients who received alemtuzumab. ',\n"," 'That trial demonstrated a high response rate of 74%, although the response duration was disappointing. There was an apparently shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab compared with the that reported in the historic intravenous trial. The characteristics of the patients were similar in our historic comparison group, making it less likely that the shorter response duration was caused by differences in patient characteristics. The shorter response may have been caused by the reduced ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to clear MRD when given for the defined treatment period. In both trials, patients received a 4-week course of alemtuzumab (12 doses) with the option for a second 4-week course for patients who had residual CLL after the first course. Fewer patients received a second course of alemtuzumab on the intravenous trial. Also, the proportion of responders who were negative for MRD was lower for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab. One difficulty in interpreting this observation is that the methods for evaluating MRD were different between trials. For the subcutaneous trial, 4-color flow cytometry was used to evaluate MRD, which potentially has different sensitivity than the PCR-based assay that was used to evaluate patients in the intravenous trial. Also, these trials were not contemporaneous but sequential; therefore, unappreciated trial effects may account in part for the differences in response duration between the patient populations. A major concern for the use of alemtuzumab in residual disease is infection, including CMV reactivation and opportunistic infections. The German CLL Study Group had to terminate their phase 3 trial, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B terminated their phase 2 trial of alemtuzumab for MRD, both because of unacceptable, infection-related toxicity. One possible explanation for this observation was a shorter duration between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that alemtuzumab can be self-administered safely by patients with residual disease, with the expected reactivation of CMV in a minority of patients. The incidence of symptomatic CMV reactivation on this trial was lower than previously reported, likely because some patients received valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis. Reactivation of CMV can be minimized, if not eliminated, with prophylactic valganciclovir. It is possible that trials of alemtuzumab for residual disease that reported serious and, in some cases, fatal infectious complications were the result of allowing too little time for immune reconstitution between fludarabine-based chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. ',\n"," 'In our previous trial of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in the current trial with 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was no treatment-related, infectious mortality. The median time from fludarabine-based therapy to alemtuzumab was >6 months, and we recommend waiting at least 4 to 6 months before initiating alemtuzumab to minimize infectious complications. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to report the self-administration of subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Patients were taught to self-administer alemtuzumab and were able to complete the treatment without complication or incident. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab was associated with local injection-site reactions, but these were mild and were minimized by supportive measures, such as applying ice before and after the injection and administering acetaminophen and diphenhydramine premedication. In the current trial, plasma alemtuzumab levels were correlated with response and response duration. There are limited reports of single-agent alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics. It is noteworthy that Hale et al evaluated the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in 30 patients with recurrent disease who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in 20 untreated patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Their analysis indicated significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters; however, the mean cumulative dose of alemtuzumab that was needed to reach a trough serum concentration of 1 microg/mL was 90mg for the intravenous group and was substantially higher at 551 mg for the subcutaneous group. Furthermore, higher trough serum alemtuzumab concentrations were correlated significantly with a better clinical response and with achieving MRD-free status. Montillo et al evaluated pharmacokinetics in 16 patients who received alemtuzumab 10 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6 weeks as treatment for residual disease. Their data indicated that patients who achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on Day 15 of therapy that was >5 microg hour/mL were more likely to achieve CR compared with individuals who had lower levels. In our study, patients who did not achieve a response had lower plasma levels of alemtuzumab at the end of treatment compared with responders. Furthermore, among the responders, those with end-of-treatment alemtuzumab levels lower than the median of 6 microg/mL had significantly shorter response duration than patients who had levels higher than the median. ',\n"," 'Given the significantly higher cumulative dose of subcutaneous alemtuzumab needed to achieve blood concentrations associated with response, we hypothesize that optimized treatment and improved safety and responses, specifically MRD-free status, could be achieved better by evaluating for MRD in a real-time fashion and administering individualized alemtuzumab subcutaneously or intravenously based on blood levels. Because blood reveals only 1 disease compartment, a time factor to allow for compartment equilibration is yet another consideration. Further work to optimize this treatment strategy may make use of a new trial design in which patients have blood alemtuzumab levels measured and undergo real-time evaluations for MRD. Patients could begin with a 4-week course (12 doses of 30 mg) of subcutaneous alemtuzumab followed by evaluations of response, MRD, and blood drug levels. For patients with residual disease, treatment could continue, and the subcutaneous alemtuzumab dose or schedule could be adjusted, depending on blood drug levels; then, treatment would continue with monthly bone marrow evaluations either until patients achieved negative MRD status or a predetermined total duration of treatment is reached for patients who remain positive with potentially adequate blood alemtuzumab levels. This remains an interesting, active, and promising therapeutic strategy for patients with CLL. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '. ',\n"," '.

We hypothesized that flavopiridol treatment could adequately de-bulk disease prior to lenalidomide therapy, decreasing the incidence of tumor flare with higher doses of lenalidomide. In this Phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached with treatment consisting of flavopiridol 30 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (IVB) + 30 mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) cycle (C) 1 day (D) 1 and 30 mg/m2 IVB + 50 mg/m2 CIVI C1 D8,15 and C2-8 D3,10,17 with lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily C2-8 D1-21. There was no unexpected toxicity seen, including no increased tumor lysis, tumor flare (even at higher doses of lenalidomide) or opportunistic infection. Significant clinical activity was demonstrated, with a 51% response rate in this group of heavily pretreated patients. Biomarker testing confirmed association of mitochondrial priming of the BH3 only peptide Puma with response. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia, characterized by leukemic cells accumulating secondary to survival and proliferation signals delivered to the cells. CLL has been increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease, with many patients being observed for several years after diagnosis prior to disease progression requiring therapy. Certain disease characteristics such as high-risk interphase cytogenetic abnormalities (del17p13 and del11q22) and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain-variable status are associated with a more rapid progression and inferior survival. Despite the improvement in overall response rates with the current standard treatment using combination chemoimmunotherapy, patients with the mentioned high-risk characteristics continue to have shorter time to progression with conventional therapies and lower response rates with repeated therapy. CLL cell survival has been attributed to a role of proliferation and also disordered apoptosis, with constitutive expression of different anti-apoptotic proteins including BCl2, MCL1 and XIAP. Contributions of the microenvironment and aberrations in innate immune response are recognized as CLL survival mechanisms. Significant survival signals are derived from both direct contact of CLL cells with stromal cells and cytokines, making development of novel therapeutics targeting the molecular alterations preventing apoptosis and the immunoregulatory defects interesting therapeutic targets. Two promising agents that either down-regulate MCL-1 or favorably enhance immune effector cell function include lenalidomide and flavopiridol. Both drugs have shown single agent activity in phase I and II trials in this population of patients. ',\n"," \"Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved for the treatment of 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma with activity in other hematologic malignancies including CLL. Lenalidomide does not promote direct cytotoxicity to CLL cells but does alter the microenvironment and immune regulation. Lenalidomide promotes cellular and innate immune activation, activates T-cells and natural killer cells altering the tumor microenvironment and down-regulates critical pro-survival cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The optimal dose and schedule of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory CLL patients is controversial due to the risks of tumor flare reaction and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Two phase II trials with single agent lenalidomide administered at doses of 10-25 mg daily in relapsed/refractory CLL reported response rates ranging from 32-47% with clinical activity in patients with high-risk cytogenetics and/or bulky disease. Tumor flare was reported in 30-58% of these patients and two cases of TLS were reported at the 25 mg daily dose. A phase 2/3 study was planned to address the question of optimal dosing comparing 10 mg versus 25 mg orally daily for 21 of 28 days; however, after four patients experienced sever tumor flare and /or TLS, the study was amended to a phase 1 trial with intra-patient-dose escalation with lenalidomide given at 2.5 mg initially, increasing to 5 mg after 28 days with subsequent 5 mg incremental increases to 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg. In that study, one-third of the patients could not escalate beyond 2.5 mg, and the response rate was only 11.5%, much lower than previously described. Flavopiridol is a broad cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, that directly antagonizes cell cycle CDK's (CDK 1 and 2) and those involved in transcription initiation (CDK 7 and 8) and elongation (CDK9). Flavopiridol induced apoptosis in CLL cell lines and primary human CLL cells, which was independent of p53. Flavopiridol also globally inhibits gene transcription, potentially leading to down-regulation of several important intracellular proteins in CLL including Mcl-1 and XIAP. Despite promising pre-clinical data, initial clinical trials of flavopiridol using a 72-hour continuous infusion, 24-hour continuous infusion and 1-hour bolus infusion were disappointing with limited clinical efficacy, likely due to plasma protein binding and sub-optimal exposure of free drug. \",\n"," 'scheduling to a 30-minute bolus (IVB) followed by 4-hour continuous infusion (CIV) weekly improved efficacy in a Phase I trial with 42 patients enrolled in 3 separate cohorts. Nineteen (45%) patients achieved a partial response to therapy with responses noted in the high risk patients, including 51% of patients with bulky lymphadenopathy, 42% of those with del(17p13.1) and 72% of those with del(11q22.3). The dose limiting toxicity was acute TLS requiring dialysis, occurring in 14% of patients, but 63% of those with WBC > 200x109/L. A Phase II trial followed, restricting eligibility to patients with < 200x109/L and using aggressive TLS prophylaxis with hydration, rasburicase, IV dexamethasone, frequent monitoring for and treatment of hyperkalemia. A total of 64 patients were enrolled with only 4 patients not being treated with dose escalation for severe TLS, 3 of those requiring hemodialysis. Thirty-four (53%) patients achieved a response to therapy with 12 (57%) of patients with del(17p13.1) and 14(50%) of patients with del(11q22.3) responding. Subsequent data analysis from these earlier trials evaluating flavopiridol in relapsed or refractory CLL patients identified female sex, bulky lymphadenopathy, high WBC, beta-2-microglobulin, and high exposure to flavopiridol-glucuronide as risk factors for TLS. Flavopiridol plasma exposure was only weakly associated with response. It is unclear if Mcl-1 down-regulation is solely responsible for the rapid tumor cell death observed in a subset of CLL patients or if other factors are important, such as priming for early mitochondrial damage. Given the promising efficacy of both of these agents in high risk and refractory patients coupled with the fact that neither agent was immunosuppressive nor associated with opportunistic infections, we elected to perform a phase I trial evaluating the potential synergy of direct flavopiridol-induced CLL cell cytotoxicity with indirect lenalidomide immunomodulatory effects. Based on the apparent opposite mechanisms for severe toxicities (i.e. tumor flare for lenalidomide vs. TLS for flavopirodol), we hypothesized dosing with single agent flavopiridol during cycle 1 with the established phase II dose would sufficiently de-bulk patients thus reducing risk for tumor flare when combined with escalating doses of lenalidomide in later cycles. Finally, we retrospectively evaluated several factors as potential biomarkers for outcomes from this combined therapy, including mitochondrial profiling of BH3-domain proteins, a functional assay surrogate for cellular ability to respond to pro-apoptotic cues. ',\n"," 'All patients were enrolled and treated on the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored (NCI 8046, U01CA076576, NCT00735930) and The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSU) institutional review board-approved phase I trial of flavopiridol in combination with lenalidomide in previously treated CLL. Written informed consent approved by The Ohio State University Human Studies committee was obtained for all patients prior to study entry. The study enrolled adult patients (>= 18 years of age) with relapsed and refractory CLL that required therapy by the IWCLL 2008 criteria. Other eligibility included: at least one prior therapy that included fludarabine unless a contra-indication existed; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <= 2; normal organ and marrow function; no active infection. The study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of flavopiridol and lenalidomide in this population of patients. Due to potential risks of coincident tumor flare and TLS from flavopiridol and lenalidomide administered concomitantly, flavopiridol was administered alone during cycle 1 to cytoreduce patients prior to combination therapy with the two agents during cycles 2-8 (Table 1). Combination therapy and dose escalation was started with the initiation of cycle 2 (Day 29). A standard 3+3 phase I design was used with 3-6 patients enrolled at each dose level with dose escalation starting during cycle 2 (Table 2). Patients were required to complete 2 cycles of therapy with < 2 patients experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) prior to dose escalation to the next dose level. DLT was defined during cycle 2 of protocol treatment (Supplemental Table 1). To minimize risk of TLS, the first dose of flavopiridol on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and day 3 of cycle 2 was administered in the hospital with standard supportive care measures and monitoring for TLS. On days 15 of cycle 1, days 10 and 17 of cycle 2 and days 3, 10 and 17 of cycles 3-8, flavopiridol was administered in the outpatient clinic provided no serious adverse events were noted with the first dose. During cycles 2-8, lenalidomide was administered orally on days 1-21, with flavopiridol dosing immediately after lenalidomide on days 3, 10 and 17. Cycle 1 was defined as 28 days and starting with cycle 2, each cycle was defined as 35 days. Patients who developed a DVT were allowed to continue protocol therapy, but were treated with a low molecular weight heparin. ',\n"," 'In patients who were unable to receive anti-coagulation due to contra-indication (i.e. the platelet count was < 50,000/mm3 or serious bleeding occurred), pulmonary embolism occurred, or a DVT recurred despite anti-coagulation, were removed from protocol therapy. Rasburicase (4.5 mg) was administered two hours prior to flavopiridol on day 1 of cycle 1 and day 3 of cycle 2 with remaining doses left to the discretion of the treating physician. Potassium monitoring was done every two hours prior to, during and one hour following treatment. Dexamethasone 20 mg orally was administered 30 minutes prior to each dose of flavopiridol and 4 mg 24 hours after each dose to prevent flavopiridol-related cytokine mediated infusion reactions. Additional corticosteroids were used at the discretion of the treating physician for patients with flavopiridol-related cytokine release or lenalidomide induced tumor flare. Anti-emetic therapy with ondansetron 8 mg orally was given 30 min prior to each flavopiridol treatment. GCSF (Neulasta) 6mg SQ was administered on day 16 of cycle 1 and day 18 of cycles 2-8. Prophylactic antiviral and antibiotic therapy including valacyclovir, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole DS were continued throughout protocol therapy. DLT was defined during cycle 2 of treatment. Those patients experiencing DLT during cycle 1, who had TLS, or who were unable or unwilling to proceed to cycle 2 were replaced. DLT was defined as the occurrence of any of the following events when considered possibly, probably or definitely related to the study treatment including 1) treatment delays > 14 days for any non-hematologic or hematologic toxicity or any grade 5 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity; 2) hematologic toxicities including grade 4 febrile neutropenia or infection, grade 3 febrile neutropenia or infection with fever or infection that fails to resolve within 7 days, or ANC < 1000/mm3 or platelets < 30,000/mm3 > 14 days after the completion of cycle 1 or 2 (i.e. day 44 or later after cycle 1 or day 51 or later after cycle 2); and 3) any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity. The following were not considered DLT: TLS, tumor flare reaction, cytokine release syndrome, alopecia, DVT responsive to anticoagulation, diarrhea responsive to medical treatment, and nausea and vomiting controllable with steroids and anti-emetic therapy, transient grade 3 and 4 electrolyte or liver function test (AST, ALT, total bilirubin) abnormalities that resolve <= grade 1 in <= 7 days. ',\n"," \"The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 was used for toxicity grading. Response was assessed by the revised National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group Guidelines for CLL. Response was evaluated after cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 (during days 22-35 of each cycle). Pharmacokinetic evaluations were conducted in collaboration with the Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource at OSU. Pharmacokinetic assessments of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite were completed on cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 2 day 3. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 4.5, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the start of flavopiridol infusion. Pharmacokinetic assessments of lenalidomide were completed during cycle 2 on days 2 and 3. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8 and 24 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of lenalidomide, flavopiridol and flavopiridol glucuronide were simultaneously determined using previously published LC-MS/MS methods. The primary endpoint of the study was to define the MTD of the combination of flavopiridol and lenalidomide using the standard 3+3 phase I design as described above and to define the specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicities of this combination in this population of patients. Common toxicities are summarized with frequency by dose level and for all patients. Baseline characteristics are described using frequencies and medians with ranges for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. PFS was measured from the date on study to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were still alive and didn't have disease progression were censored at the last visit for PFS. OS was determined from the date of study to the date of death from any cause or date of observation. Patients who were still alive were censored at the last visit. Survival curves were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed in Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3.0.395 and resulting parameters summarized in graphic and tabular format. Thawed aliquots of pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells containing CLL cells were purified for untouched B-cells by non-B-cell depletion using a cocktail of biotinylated monoclonal Abs (CD2, CD4, CD11b, CD16, CD36, Anti-IgE, and CD235a (glycophorin) and magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Of 32 patients treated with lenalidomide and flavopiridol, specimens were available and assessed for 26. \",\n"," 'The extent of cell purification was monitored by flow cytometry of stained cells before and after purification with anti-CD19-APC and anti-biotin antibody-FITC for the presence of non-B cells labeled with MAbs from depletion cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Specimens (2x105 cells/assay) were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated with JC-1 mitochondrial dye and 100 microM BH3 peptides (Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bmf, Hrk; Bim and Puma were also assayed at 0.1 microM and 10 microM, respectively) or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO [(1%]) or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP [10 microM]). Samples were run in triplicate and fluorescent traces of JC-1 dye monitored over 300 min of assay. Area under the curve was integrated relative to the positive control uncoupling reagent after normalization for DMSO background: Association between biomarker status (% priming) and clinical response classification was by Mann-Whitney Test. We pre-determined a statistical analysis plan with significance of p<0.05. Marker predictive ability was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Analyses utilized SAS software, version 9.2 (Cary, NC), R version 2.14.2 (Vienna, Austria), and/or Graphpad Prism version 5.04 (La Jolla, CA). A total of 39 patients were treated on Cohorts 1 (n=8), Cohort 2 (n=9), Cohort 3 (n=4), Cohort 4 (n=4), Cohort 5 (n=10), Cohort 6 (n=4) (Table 2). Median age was 62 years (range 26-74) and there was a male predominance (26). Median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1-10). Patients had the following high-risk features: del(17p13.1) in 22 patients; del(11q22.3) in 15 patients; complex karyotype in 31 patients; fludarabine refractory in 14 patients. Baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 3. Dose limiting toxicities occurred in three patients and included Grade 3-4 transaminitis in two patients, one at dose level 1 and one at dose level two, and grade 3 absolute neutrophil count lasting greater than 14 days in one patient at dose level 5. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hematologic: neutropenia (n=32 or 82%), anemia (n=16 or 41%), thrombocytopenia (n=20 or 51%) and lymphopenia (n=9 or 23%); gastrointestinal: diarrhea (n=18 or 46%); metabolic: transaminitis (n=17 or 44%), hypophosphatemia (n=12 or 31%), hypocalcemia (n=6 or 15%); hypokalemia (n=11 or 28%), hyperkalemia (n=6 or 15%); hyperglycemia (n=17 or 44%) and TLS (n=10 or 26%). TLS occurred only during cycle 1, and three of the patients with TLS were replaced. There was only one patient with Grade 3 tumor flare. ',\n"," 'This patient had lenalidomide held for painful splenomegaly on day 10 of cycle 2 until cycle 3 and was treated with three days of steroids with lenalidomide dose reduced to 7.5 mg for cycle 3. The patient had recurrence of painful splenomegaly on day 10 of cycle 3, and lenalidomide was held again with two days of steroid treatment given. When lenalidomide was restarted at 7.5 mg, the patient again had recurrence of symptoms in four days and was removed from study. A total of fifteen patients required dose reductions. Grade 3-4 adverse events are summarized in Table 4. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine patients were evaluable for response completing at least two cycles. Of the eight patients that were not evaluable for response 2 had progressive disease in cycle 1, 3 were replaced for TLS in cycle 1, 1 had thrombocytopenia after cycle 1 whose platelet count did not recover to > 30,000 prior to cycle 2, and 2 had DLT with transaminitis during cycle 2. Of the thirty-one evaluable patients there was a 51% overall response rate, all of which were partial responses. Of the 22 patients with del(17p13.1), 11 (50%) of patients responded and of the 14 patients with del(11q22.3), 10 (71%) responded. These factors associated with inferior outcome to standard therapy did not show a statistically significant association with response (p value 0.62, 0.14 respectively). Median PFS for all patients was 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.7-11.2). Median PFS for patients with del(17p13.1) was 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.5-13.0) versus 8.6 months (95% CI: 3.0-16.0) for patients without del(17p13.1), showing PFS is not significantly associated with del(17p13.1) (p-value=0.71). Seven patients went on to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Of these seven patients, one was lost to follow-up; one had graft failure with multi-organ failure due to complications and died at 2 months post-transplant; one progressed within 6 months of transplant and died of infectious complications at 11 months post-transplant; one relapsed at 12 months post-transplant and went on to receive three other therapies prior to dying of infectious complications 32 months post-transplant; and at last follow-up three were still alive and without evidence of disease at 35, 37, and 38 months post-transplant. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for flavopiridol pharmacokinetics on cycle 1 day 1 and thirty-two on cycle 2 day 3 (Figure 1). ',\n"," 'Pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide were evaluable for thirty-one patients on cycle 2 day 2 and thirty-two patients on cycle 2 day 3. Average observed maximum concentrations (Cmax) of lenalidomide reached 0.97uM, and the average observed Cmax of flavopiridol was 3.50uM (Figure 1 and Supplemental Material Figure 1). Non-compartmental parameter estimates for clearance, Cmax and volume of distribution were consistent with previously reported values (Table 5). When flavopiridol and lenalidomide were administered in combination, PK plots and parameter estimates of lenalidomide were consistent with those for lenalidomide alone (Supplemental Table 2). At 60 mg/m2, flavopiridol AUC (p=0.03) and Cmax (p=0.01) tended to increase when lenalidomide dose was increased, as shown in Supplemental Table 3. However, this trend was not observed at the higher 80 mg/m2 flavopiridol dose. Flavopiridol-glucuronide data was available from 30 patients. Of the 10 patients with TLS, flavopiridol-glucuronide data was available for 8 patients (data not shown). No trends or significant associations were observed between plasma flavopiridol-glucuronide pharmacokinetics and TLS. From 32 study participants who would be treated with flavopiridol and lenalidomide, aliquots of pre-treatment specimens were available from 26 with defined evaluable outcomes (median age of 60 years [range: 26-74 years]). Specimens were thawed and exposed in vitro to individual BH3 peptides, including an activator (Bim) and several sensitizers (Noxa, Puma, Bad, Hrk) as surrogates for the function of Bcl-2 family proteins. One sample was eliminated from statistical analysis due to insufficient number of viable cells thus yielding 25 specimens with analyzable data. All specimens were analyzed in triplicate, with coefficients of variation (CV) for repeat samples from individual patients generally <5%. The percent priming, i.e. quantifiable propensity of a given BH3 peptide to induce mitochondrial depolarization relative to an uncoupling control agent, for each peptide is summarized in Table 6 separately for patients who responded to study therapy (i.e. achieved partial response) and those who did not respond to treatment (stable disease/progressive disease). Among the peptides assayed, Puma(10) alone elicited a priming trend between responders (32.8 +- 16.5% [mean+-SD]) and non-responders (22.3 +- 9.9%; p= .059); the percent priming with Puma(10) for individual patients is depicted in Figure 2. To test the ability of Puma to serve as a predictive biomarker, we employed the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker, which yielded an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.53-0.94; p=0.027; Figure 2). ',\n"," 'In assessment of patient clinical information (Table 6,) bulky disease of >5 cm trended with patient response (Mann-Whitney p-value =0.088; AUC=0.68 (95% CI: 0.53-0.84), AUC p-value=0.022). We performed adjusted analyses of Puma priming in which we accounted for bulky disease >5 cm as a second covariate. As shown in Figure 2, adjustment for bulky disease (>5 cm) improved the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.99). The AUC p-value =0.0063 was significant for Puma combined with bulky disease (p-value <0.01; p<0.05/5 BH3 profiling biomarkers with Bonferroni correction for multiple analyses). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined flavopiridol and lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory CLL with the hypothesis that higher doses of lenalidomide would be tolerated with less tumor flare observed in patients who received flavopiridol for disease reduction prior to the initiation of lenalidomide. In this Phase I dose-escalation study of combined flavopiridol and lenalidomide in relapsed CLL, the MTD was not reached with the highest dose being given at dose level 6 with treatment of flavopiridol given in cycle 1 at a dose of 30 mg/m2 IVB + 30 mg/m2 CIVI day 1 of cycle 1 and 30 mg/m2 IVB + 50 mg/m2 CIVI day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 3, 10 and 17 of cycles 2-8 immediately after lenalidomide dosing and lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily days 1-21 of cycles 2-8. There was no unexpected toxicity seen, including no increased risk of TLS, tumor flare, or opportunistic infection. Significant clinical activity was demonstrated, with a 51% response rate in this group of relapsed, heavily pretreated patients. The response rate was not affected by the presence of high-risk genomic features, with a 50% response rate in patients with del(17p13.1) and a 71% response rate in patients with del(11q22.3). Additionally, seven patients (18%) were able to proceed with allogeneic stem cell transplant, a potentially curative therapy in these poor-risk patients. Three patients remained without evidence of disease at 3 years post-transplant. Ten (26%) of patients did experience grade 3-4 TLS, all occurring in cycle 1 of therapy with 3 of these patients being replaced. This was a slightly lower rate of TLS compared to previous studies. Furthermore, unlike those previous studies, which revealed higher rates of TLS in female CLL patients, TLS in this study appeared evenly distributed between males (7/26, 27%) and females (3/13, 23%). ',\n"," 'Furthermore, unlike previous studies that revealed significant associations between TLS and flavopiridol glucuronide exposures, we found no such associations in this study. Only one patient (3%) experienced grade 3 tumor flare and was unable to continue with lenalidomide therapy due to symptoms, despite being able to reach a dose of 15 mg orally of lenalidomide in Cycles 2-8. In prior studies using single agent lenalidomide at doses of 10-25 mg daily in relapsed CLL, 30-60% of patients experienced tumor flare. Two separate phase I studies had to modify the planned study to reduce the dose of lenalidomide from 10-15 mg daily initial dose down to a dose of 2.5 mg daily due to serious tumor flare. It may be possible to further increase lenalidomide dosing in these patients that have received cytoreduction prior to lenalidomide initiation. Biomarker testing yielded interesting results for association of mitochondrial priming (BH3 profiling) of the BH3 only peptide Puma with response. A pro-apoptotic modulator of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Puma functions as a general sensitizer. As such, Puma may not be used to specifically address whether a malignancy is driven by specific anti-apoptotic BH3 proteins, but rather it displays a global propensity of cells to respond to intrinsic pro-apoptotic cues. Previous BH3 profiling studies established that flavopiridol response in CLL patients was Bcl-xL dependent. It is perhaps not surprising that a more complex combination treatment comprising therapies with different mechanisms would be associated with a BH3 peptide that modulates multiple anti-apoptotic proteins. Further, while we would classify this as a trend between Puma profiling and response (Mann-Whitney p = 0.059; AUC p=0.027) the observation is interesting when placed in the context of the dose escalation component of the study design. Further, Puma priming when combined with bulky disease as a clinical adjustment variable displayed significant association with response (p=0.0063) indicating that additional observation may be warranted in follow-on CLL clinical studies with uniformly defined treatment regimens comprising lenalidomide and flavopiridol. In summary, this phase I dose escalation study demonstrates that the combination of flavopiridol and oral lenalidominde is feasible and well tolerated in heavily pretreated CLL patients. By treating patients with flavopiridol prior to lenalidomide therapy to decrease tumor burden, patients were able to tolerate higher doses of lenalidomide and only one patient experienced tumor flare.

',\n"," 'We evaluated the safety and biologic activity of the BH3 mimetic protein, navitoclax, combined with rituximab, in comparison to rituximab alone. One hundred and eighteen patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were randomized to receive eight weekly doses of rituximab (arm A), eight weekly doses of rituximab plus daily navitoclax for 12 weeks (arm B) or eight weekly doses of rituximab plus daily navitoclax until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (arm C). Investigator-assessed overall response rates (complete [CR] and partial [PR]) were 35% (arm A), 55% (arm B, p = 0.19 vs. A) and 70% (arm C, p = 0.0034 vs. A). Patients with del(17p) or high levels of BCL2 had significantly better clinical responses when treated with navitoclax. Navitoclax in combination with rituximab was well tolerated as initial therapy for patients with CLL, yielded higher response rates than rituximab alone and resulted in prolonged progression-free survival with treatment beyond 12 weeks. Apoptosis is an interplay between pro-survival proteins and pro-apoptosis proteins in the BCL2 family of proteins. The overexpression of BCL2 anti-apoptotic proteins sequesters pro-apoptotic proteins of the same family, leading to enhanced cell survival. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, thereby enhancing the capacity of CLL cells to resist spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. BH3 mimetics are a class of drugs designed to compete for the BH3-binding pocket in pro-survival proteins to displace sequestered pro-apoptosis proteins. ABT-737 is a small molecule inhibitor that mimics the BH3 protein, BAD, by binding to BCL2, BCLXL or BCLW, and thereby antagonizing their capacity to sequester pro-apoptosis proteins. CLL is responsive to ABT-737, and a mechanistic dissection points specifically to its ability to displace BIM from BCL2 where it is constitutively sequestered. ABT-737 has been developed into a second-generation, orally available therapeutic agent, ABT-263 (navitoclax), with similar binding properties. In addition to expressing high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, CLL cells also express high levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, making CLL cells particularly sensitive to inhibition of BCL2 by navitoclax. Navitoclax can enhance the anti-leukemia activity of rituximab, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in vitro. CLL cells that express high levels of BCL2, or that have a high ratio of BCL2 to MCL1 or other BCL2 family members, appear most sensitive to navitoclax or ABT-737. ',\n"," 'In a phase 1 study, patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who were treated with navitoclax had a 35% overall response rate (ORR). Study-emergent thrombocytopenia was managed through the implementation of a lead-in period, and neutropenia was reversible with dose reduction or administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Based on the single-agent data, the present study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biologic activity of navitoclax and rituximab versus rituximab alone, in the initial therapy of patients with CLL. An open-label phase 2, randomized three-arm, multicenter trial was performed in patients with CLL (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01087151). Patients provided written informed consent, and protocol approvals were obtained from national health authorities and independent ethics committees for each site. The study was conducted at 47 sites in nine countries in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria as the time from study entry until objective disease progression or death. Patients aged >= 18 years were eligible if they had previously untreated CLL that required treatment according to iwCLL criteria; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 due to CLL; and adequate marrow, renal and hepatic function (baseline platelet counts > 75 000/mm to allow for drug-related thrombocytopenia, hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count >= 1000/muL, serum creatinine <= 2.0 mg/dL or measured clearance >= 50 mL/min, alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase/alkaline phosphatase [ALT/AST/ALP] <=3.0 times the upper limit of normal [ULN], bilirubin <=1.5 x ULN unless Gilbert syndrome present, activated partial thromboplastin time/prothrombin time <=1.2 x ULN). Exclusion criteria included receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin), drugs that affect platelet function (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel), active infection or chronic viral infection (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]). Patients were stratified by Binet stage and high-risk cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion). Patients self-administered ABT-263 in liquid or tablet form, on a daily basis. Rituximab infusion occurred on a weekly basis in the infusion room of each participating site. ',\n"," '1 week [week 1], then 250 mg daily x 12 weeks) and arm C (rituximab 375 mg/m2 week 1, 500 mg/m2 each week 2-8, plus navitoclax 100 mg daily x 1 week [week 1], then 250 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). The rituximab dose chosen for investigation (500 mg/m2 subsequent to an initial dose of 375 mg/m2) is similar to that used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosph-amide, which resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patient outcomes. Patients randomized to ABT-263 arms B and C received the \"lead-in\" dose of 100 mg/day ABT-263 identified in the phase 1 study, followed by the final dose of 250 mg/day. The lead-in dose period lasted 8-15 days and was intended to allow for monitoring of the effects of low-dose ABT-263 on the platelet counts of treated patients. Patients enrolled in arm A who experienced disease progression at least 2 months after the last rituximab infusion were eligible for cross-over to arm B (rituximab for 8 weeks plus navitoclax daily for 12 weeks). Due to the mechanistic and early effect of navitoclax on platelet counts, it was not practical to treat patients enrolled in the rituximab-only arm with a placebo in blinded fashion. Patients on arm C who were responding to navitoclax were given the option to continue on a roll-over protocol for continued navitoclax treatment once they discontinued from the study. The ABT-263 was continued until disease progression or for 1 year, whichever came first. No further efficacy outcomes were collected on these patients. Safety was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) (version 4.0) for the standardized classification of adverse events (AEs) of drugs used in cancer therapy. Special emphasis was focused on grade >= 3 AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and grade >= 3 laboratory toxicities, and relationship to study treatment. An Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) conducted a formal safety data review from the first 30 patients treated on the combination arms B and C before additional enrollment was allowed. Thereafter, safety review meetings by the IMC were required approximately every 6 months. Navitoclax and rituximab pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were obtained at multiple visits throughout the study. ',\n"," 'Navitoclax plasma PK samples were obtained coincident with the week 1, lead-in day 5 dose: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-dose; and on week 8, day 1: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-dose in arm B and arm C. Pre-infusion and post-infusion rituximab samples were obtained on day 1 at weeks 2, 4 and 8, and rituximab concentrations were subsequently followed at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24. Navitoclax concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method. Rituximab concentrations in serum were analyzed using a validated immunoassay. Baseline bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) were collected by optional consent from patients randomly assigned to one of the three arms of this study. Protein expression of BCL2 and related family proteins were measured by intracellular staining after gating on CD19/CD5 positive CLL cells in a flow assisted cell sorting assay on fresh samples run at a central laboratory (Esoterix, Inc.) (LabCorp Clinical Trials, Cranford, NJ) within 72 h of sample collection. The following analytes were evaluated in BMAs by flow cytometry for statistical analysis: BCL2, BCLXL, MCL1, A1, BIM and NOXA, and the ratios of BCL2/MCL1 and BCLXL/MCL1. BMAs were also examined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD), relapse or death on study from any cause within 12 weeks of last tumor assessment. The study investigators assessed for clinical response using the updated iwCLL criteria. Response was assessed at week 12, and every 12 weeks during follow-up. This trial was designed to estimate the magnitude of treatment effect rather than for formal hypothesis testing. The study was originally planned to enroll 120 patients to observe approximately 72 investigator-assessed PFS events across the three treatment arms combined. Due to early discontinuation of the trial, the final study data for analysis included only 27 patients who had experienced a PFS event instead of the planned 72 patients. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm. Objective response, defined as a complete or partial response according to the modified iwCLL criteria, was estimated, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each treatment arm. ',\n"," 'The difference in objective response rate between the treatment arms was also calculated along with the 95% confidence intervals. p-Values for treatment group comparison were based on chi2 tests. Due to the explorative nature of the study, no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. Biomarker subgroups were derived by the median value of expression for each biomarker. Biomarker analysis was intended to evaluate the correlation between BCL2 levels with efficacy outcomes. Since biomarker data were available for only a small subset of patients, arms B and C were pooled to provide a larger number of patients receiving combination treatment for comparison with rituximab alone. Odds ratios of an objective response were calculated between treatment arms (arm A vs. arm B and arm C combined) for biomarker low and high groups. Logistic regression was used for each biomarker and expression subgroup. Baseline characteristics were compared between treatment arms. The sponsor provided study drug and collaborated with investigators on study design, collection, analysis and interpretation of data, writing the report and the decision to submit the paper for publication. The corresponding author had full access to all the data. This study enrolled a total of 118 patients (Figure 1), who had (Table I) a median baseline lymphocyte count of 53 000/mm3 (range 7000-552 000/mm3), median age of 63 years and 55% Binet stage B + C disease. Baseline characteristics and prognostic factors of patients randomly assigned to each arm were generally balanced between each of the treatment groups. FISH analyses of pretreatment samples revealed that 31% or 28% of patients had CLL cells with deletions in 11q or 17p, respectively. While neither safety nor toxicity was an issue, the study ended prematurely, as the sponsor decided instead to develop a more selective BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, which appeared less likely than navitoclax to induce thrombocytopenia, but that still could selectively dissociate BCL2/BIM heterodimers. All patients had either completed their treatment period or were allowed to continue on navitoclax at the time the trial was closed. Only the follow-up was discontinued early, but not the treatment. It is noteworthy that given the small sample size, this trial is hypothesis-generating and is able to detect only a large benefit of combination therapy with rituximab and ABT-263. It does not have adequate power to detect minimal clinically meaningful differences between the combination treatment arms and arm A. ',\n"," 'Thus, formal hypothesis testing is limited in that statistically negative outcomes do not necessarily rule out clinically significant effects. Ninety-one patients (77%) completed the navitoclax study; four patients crossed over to arm B from arm A. The median time on study was 34 weeks; arm A: 24 weeks (range 12-83 weeks); arm B: 33 weeks (1-105 weeks); and arm C: 44 weeks (2-86 weeks). More patients withdrew from study due to AEs in arm C (8 [20%]) than in arm A (0 [0%]) or arm B (4 [11%]). Patients in arm C, who were randomized to continue daily navitoclax after completing six cycles of rituximab, had a longer time on study (median of 44 weeks) than patients in either arm B (33 weeks) or arm A (24 weeks), because this study arm stayed open longer than the other two study arms to allow for continued administration of navitoclax. The percentages of patients who experienced grade >= 3 AEs was greater in arms B and C than in arm A. Grade >= 3 AEs (with an incidence of 5% or greater, Table II) included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain), chills, fatigue, ALT/AST/bilirubin elevations and infusion-related reactions to rituximab. Two patients had grade 5 AEs, one each (3%) in arms A and B, neither of which was assessed by the investigator as being related to treatment with navitoclax. The incidence of SAEs was not increased in patients treated with navitoclax compared to patients treated with rituximab alone. One patient had grade 3 bleeding (epistaxis). A total of 12 patients discontinued navitoclax due to an AE, four (11%) in arm B and eight (20%) in arm C. AEs leading to discontinuation of therapy with navitoclax included elevations in AST and/or ALT (six patients), pain (n = 1), hyperbilirubinemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 1), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), serum sickness (n = 1) or reaction to the infusion of rituximab (n = 1). While liver function test (LFT) abnormalities usually responded to dose adjustments, of the six patients who discontinued navitoclax, four patients in arm B discontinued at study days 37, 43, 56 and 58, while two patients on arm C discontinued at day 170 and day 316, respectively. Most of the LFT-associated discontinuations (four of the six) occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. ',\n"," 'Other reasons for discontinuation of therapy were less common: physician decision (n = 5 [4%]), sponsor decision (n = 2 [2%]) and subject/guardian decision (n = 6 [5%]). Grade >= 3 infusion-related reactions were uncommon, but more often were observed in patients treated in arm B (n = 3 [8%]) or C (n = 2 [5%]), one of which was an SAE; no patient in arm A had such an AE. Two patients died while on study, one in arm A, who died on day 163 with a pulmonary embolism, judged by the treating physician as being unrelated to rituximab treatment. One patient in arm B died on day 8 due to hypotension, which was viewed by the site investigator as being related to the infusion of rituximab. Plasma concentrations of navitoclax are shown in Table III. The maximum navitoclax concentrations (Cmax) were observed approximately 6 h after oral administration. The Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of navitoclax in this study were similar to those observed in patients treated with single-agent navitoclax in prior phase 1 studies, indicating that co-treatment with rituximab does not alter the PK of navitoclax. Patients treated in arm A had serum concentrations of rituximab that were comparable to those measured in patients treated in arm B or arm C, indicating that navitoclax does not affect the PK of rituximab. Rituximab levels were consistent across the three arms at other sampling visits from week 2 to week 24 as well (Supplemental Table I, Supplemental Figure 1 to be found online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2015.1030638). The rituximab concentration levels achieved in this study using weekly dosing were higher than those observed in patients with CLL treated with rituximab given once every 28 days. Achievement of clinical response correlated significantly with BCL2 levels (interaction effect p = 0.048), but did not correlate with levels of other BCL2 family members tested. Patients with CLL cells that had high-level expression of BCL2 protein had significantly higher odds of achieving a favorable clinical response when treated with navitoclax and rituximab, than when treated with rituximab alone (Table IV). In comparison, patients with low BCL2 had similar odds of achieving a favorable response when treated with navitoclax and rituximab as when treated with rituximab alone. ',\n"," 'The data on patients treated with navitoclax in arms B and C were combined for this analysis and compared to the data on patients treated with rituximab alone (arm A). This was done to help identify biomarkers that correlated with a favorable outcome to treatment with navitoclax and rituximab versus treatment with rituximab alone. Similar effects were also observed when comparing arms A vs. B and also arms A vs. C (data not shown). The ORR for patients treated in arm C was 70% (Table V). This compared favorably to the ORR of patients treated in arm B (55%) and was significantly greater than the ORR of patients treated in arm A (35%; p = 0034). Two patients in arm C (5%) achieved a complete response (n = 2, 5%), which was not observed for patients in other treatment arms. Twenty-seven PFS events had occurred at the time of study closure (38% of 72 events planned). These events included one patient who died (arm A), 24 patients who had stable disease or objective response (11 patients in arm A, 10 in arm B and three in arm C) and two patients (arm A) who had stable disease or objective response but subsequently went on to have progressive disease. PFS was significantly longer for arm C than for arm B or arm A (Figure 2). Arm B trended toward longer PFS than arm A. Response duration and median PFS cannot be quantified precisely due to the limited follow-up and patient numbers. Four patients crossed over from arm A to arm B. No exploratory analyses of efficacy data were performed on the cross-over period for these four patients. However, one patient had a partial response while on arm A while three patients had stable disease while on arm A and subsequently had progressive disease. Patients treated with navitoclax in combination with rituximab achieved higher ORR than patients treated with rituximab alone as initial therapy for CLL. The improved treatment outcome with navitoclax was also evident for patients who had CLL with del(17p). Similarly, improvement in treatment outcomes with navitoclax was seen in patients with CLL with other prognostic features such as del(11q) or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IgVH) (data not shown). Disease progression after therapy was observed earliest in patients treated with rituximab alone (arm A). Patients in arm C appeared to have the longest PFS. ',\n"," 'Treatment with navitoclax and rituximab was well tolerated. First, we did not observe any interactions between navitoclax and rituximab that altered the PK of either drug. Second, there were few grade >= 3 AEs that were observed more frequently in patients treated with both agents than in those treated with rituximab alone. Those AEs noted more frequently by patients treated with navitoclax included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and elevations in hepatic transaminases. Navitoclax-related thrombocytopenia is caused by shortened platelet survival due to inhibition of BCLXL, a protein necessary for normal platelet survival. This was managed by initiating therapy with a lead-in dose of 100 mg navitoclax 1 week before advancing to the 250 mg daily dose, to allow time for the marrow to increase platelet production and provide a steady-state platelet count sufficient for hemostasis. Thereafter, platelet counts were closely monitored and treatment was temporarily held or given at a reduced dose if the counts dropped. Patients also were cautioned not to use aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs while on treatment. This management appears to have mitigated risk, as the only report of bleeding among the navitoclax-treated patients was a single AE of self-limited epistaxis. Neutropenia, another mechanistic-based effect of navitoclax, was managed with dose reductions, temporary discontinuation and administration of granulocyte stimulating factor. There was no increase in infections or febrile neutropenia compared with treatment with rituximab alone. These on-target AEs and the liver function abnormalities were manageable in most cases with dose adjustments, use of granulocyte stimulating growth factor or temporary discontinuation. Nonetheless, cytopenias (one each of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) and transaminase elevations (six patients) led to the discontinuation of navitoclax in a minority of patients. Two additional patients discontinued navitoclax due to hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic transaminase elevations, respectively. Earlier studies hypothesized that the high expression of BCL2 and BIM and their association in pre-existing complexes in CLL cells would make these cells particularly sensitive to navitoclax. We found BCL2 to be well expressed in patients on this study. We further tested whether quantitative levels of BCL2, BIM and related family members would be associated with improved responses to the combination of navitoclax and rituximab. Patients with CLL cells that expressed high levels of BCL2 (above the median) appeared to have had a more favorable response to therapy with navitoclax and rituximab than with rituximab alone. ',\n"," \"These data suggest that the benefit from the addition of navitoclax to rituximab is associated with high-level CLL-cell expression of BCL2 protein. It further supports the use of baseline BCL2 protein expression as a predictive biomarker of response to navitoclax. A similar relationship was not identified for the pretreatment levels of BCLXL or MCL1, making it appear sufficient to use a more selective BCL2 antagonist. In contrast to the findings here, no significant correlation between level of expression of BCL2 and response was observed in the phase 1 study of navitoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL. This could be explained by potential biological differences between the relapsed/refractory and frontline patient population. It is also worth noting that the use of a standardized assay that was run real-time in a central laboratory on fresh patient samples may have improved quantification of protein biomarkers in the present study. However, the magnitude of the benefit from navitoclax treatment versus rituximab alone in patients with high BCL2 protein levels would need to be confirmed prospectively. The caveat to the results is the small sample size in this study, and that the analysis is exploratory. To compensate for the limited availability of data, arms B and C were pooled for the biomarker analysis where time/duration was different in arms B and C, but was not a parameter that influenced bio-marker data outcome. It must be noted that data for arms B and C were not pooled when analyzing PFS, for the PFS out-come is dependent on time/duration, which were different in the three arms. Patients treated with navitoclax and rituximab in either arm C or arm B had a significantly higher response rate than did patients treated with rituximab alone on arm A. Patients treated in arm C, who continued treatment with navitoclax, appeared to have a longer PFS than patients treated in the other study arms. Although these differences were statistically significant, caution should be exercised in interpreting these data in view of the limited follow-up period due to the study's premature discontinuation. In any case, the results of this study indicate that a high-affinity BCL2 inhibitor combined with rituximab can potentially result in high ORRs in the frontline therapy of patients with CLL, and that a combination with monoclonal antibodies may further increase the response rate. \",\n"," 'Of note, the observed response rate of patients with del(17p) was similar to that of patients without this adverse prognostic marker; in arm C, 60% of patients with del(17p) CLL had either a complete or partial response, while in the ITT population 70% of patients showed an overall response. Overall, the regimen of navitoclax and rituximab was well tolerated, with the principal toxicities being dose-related thrombocytopenia, presumably due to inhibition of BCLXL, and transient elevations in hepatic transaminases. Preliminary results indicate that a BH3-mimetic inhibitor of BCL2 could be highly effective when used in combination with rituximab for treatment of patients with CLL. Although the combination of ABT-263 and rituximab was deemed tolerable and offered a high response rate, the thrombocytopenia caused by BCLXL inhibition limited increases to optimize drug levels and complicated combinations with other drugs. At the same time, a highly selective BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, had been developed with very high affinity for BCL2 and effectively no BCLXL inhibition. This study provided additional data supporting the concept of BCL2 inhibition as an effective treatment approach for CLL and demonstrated that an increased response may be possible with a monoclonal antibody combination.

',\n"," 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily affects older persons who often have coexisting conditions in addition to disease-related immunosuppression and myelosuppression. We conducted an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial to compare two oral agents, ibrutinib and chlorambucil, in previously untreated older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. We randomly assigned 269 previously untreated patients who were 65 years of age or older and had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive ibrutinib or chlorambucil. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review committee. The median age of the patients was 73 years. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than did chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months), with a risk of progression or death that was 84% lower with ibrutinib than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; P<0.001). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival; the estimated survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death that was 84% lower in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (hazard ratio, 0.16; P=0.001). The overall response rate was higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%, P<0.001). The rates of sustained increases from baseline values in the hemoglobin and platelet levels were higher with ibrutinib. Adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea; adverse events occurring in at least 20% of those receiving chlorambucil included nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting. In the ibrutinib group, four patients had a grade 3 hemorrhage and one had a grade 4 hemorrhage. A total of 87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group are continuing to take ibrutinib. Ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as assessed by progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; RESONATE-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01722487.) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia among adults in Western countries; it affects primarily older persons, with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years. Chlorambucil has been a standard first-line therapy in CLL, especially for older patients or those with coexisting conditions. Until recently, no treatment was clearly superior to chlorambucil in this population.

Patients received rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil every four weeks for six cycles. Rituximab plus chlorambucil-treated patients without a complete response after Cycle 6 received chlorambu- cil monotherapy for at least six additional cycles or until complete response. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (confirmed by bone marrow biopsy) after Cycle 6 in first-line patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease, and safety. Overall, 357 patients were randomized (rit- uximab plus bendamustine, n=178; rituximab plus chlorambucil, n=179; intent-to-treat population), including 241 first-line patients (n=121 and n=120, respectively); 355 patients received treatment (n=177 and n=178, respectively; safety population). In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; P=0.002) and median progression-free survival (ritux- imab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil,  30 months; P=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall sur- vival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus ben- damustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% vs. 36%).

Chemotherapy options for these patients include bendamustine (B) and chlorambucil (Clb). In treatment-naïve CLL patients, phase II studies showed promising efficacy with rituximab plus B (R-B) Clb (R-Clb), 8,9  while the phase III CLL11 study demon- strated improved efficacy with R-Clb and obinutuzumab plus Clb (G-Clb) versus Clb monotherapy. 10,11 G-Clb also increased progression-free survival (PFS) and complete response (CR) rates versus R-Clb, 10,11 although infusion- related reactions and neutropenia were more common; infection rates were not increased, however. While a phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of CR and PFS with B versusClb in treatment-naïve CLL, 12,13 the activity of R-B versusR-Clb has not been directly com- pared. Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. ',\n"," 'Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. Methods  Study design  Patients received rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m Day [D] 1, Cycle [C] 1 and 500 mg/m D1, C2-C6) plus B (intravenous 90 mg/m [1L] or 70 mg/m [2L] D1 and D2, C1-C6) or Clb (oral 10 mg/m D1-D7, C1-C6) every four weeks for six cycles. R-Clb patients without CR after C6 received Clb monotherapy for ≤6 additional cycles or until CR. After treatment completion, patients were followed every three months for one year, then every six months until data cut-off. Treatment was discontinued if the patient had progressive disease. MABLE was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local laws, and approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees at participating centers. All patients provided written informed con- sent. Patients Patients were aged ≥18 years, with confirmed CLL requiring treatment as per the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) cri- teria, Binet stage B/C disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, and investigator assess- ment of ineligibility for fludarabine-based treatment (Online Supplementary Information). Exclusion criteria included transforma- tion to aggressive B-cell malignancy and previous malignancy within five years of enrollment (unless treated with curative intent). For full inclusion and exclusion criteria see the Online Supplementary Information. During recruitment, the protocol was amended to permit inclu- sion of patients with progressive Binet stage A disease and to exclude 2L patients (due to slow recruitment). All 2L patients recruited before this amendment were included in the final analy- sis, as tumor response in this patient subpopulation was a second- ary study endpoint; however, as the number of 2L patients enrolled was relatively small, there was insufficient power to show statistically significant differences between study treat- ments in this patient subpopulation. Study endpoints The primary endpoint was CR rate (confirmed by bone marrow [BM] biopsy) after C6 in 1L patients. Secondary endpoints includ- ed CR rate after C6 in 2L patients, PFS, overall survival (OS), time to next leukemic treatment, minimal residual disease (MRD), and safety. Response was assessed after C3 and C6 as per iwCLL 2008 guidelines. Response was also assessed in the R-Clb arm at C12, with treatment being discontinued for patients showing evidence of CR during C7-C12. ',\n"," 'Assessments are detailed in the Online Supplementary Information. Safety Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs v4.0 and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v17.0. Statistical analysis Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients). The safety population included all randomized patients who received treatment. For 1L patients, the between-arm difference in response rates was tested using a one-sided continuity-corrected χ test. A two- sided continuity-corrected χ test assessed between-arm differ- ences in overall response rates (ORRs) and molecular responses. PFS and OS were summarized by Kaplan–Meier estimates and compared viathe log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con- fidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on the Cox propor- tional hazard model, with and without baseline Binet stage as a covariate. Results Patients The study was conducted between 23 February 2010 and 31 March 2014. Of the 357 patients in the ITT popu- lation, comprising 241 1L patients (R-B, n=121; R-Clb, n=120) and 116 2L patients (R-B, n=57; R-Clb, n=59), 355 received treatment (R-B, n=177; R-Clb, n=178). Ninety- five patients (27%) withdrew from treatment during the study (Figure 1). Overall, 92/120 (76.7%) 1L patients treated with R-B and 97/120 (80.8%) 1L patients treated with R-Clb received six cycles of rituximab; 92 (76.7%) and 57 (47.5%) received six cycles of B and Clb, respectively. Twelve (10.0%) patients treated with R-Clb received 12 cycles of Clb. The median number of R, B and Clb doses was six for each. The median (interquartile range) dose of rituximab was 4780.5 mg (4222.5-5346.5) in 1L patients treated with R-B and 5028.5 mg (4546.0-5349.0) in 1L patients treated with R-Clb. In total, 6/121 (5.0%) patients treated with R-B and 2/120 (1.7%) patients treated with R- Clb had a reduction or delay in their treatment schedule due to treatment-emergent toxicities. Baseline characteristics were balanced in the 1L popula- tion (Table 1; baseline characteristics for all patients are presented in Online Supplementary Table S1). Deletion of 17p was not an exclusion criterion due to a lack of efficacy data relating to 17p deletion for the treatment combina- tions used at the time of study design. Thus, 13 1L patients (R-B, 10; R-Clb, 3) with 17p deletion were includ- ed. Median follow-up was 23.5 months (R-B) and 23.3 months (R-Clb). ',\n"," 'Median age in 1L patients was 72 years in both treatment arms; the majority of patients were aged 65 years or more. The median number of comorbidities (active medical conditions) in 1L patients was three in both arms (Table 1); the most common comorbidities were vascular disorders and metabolism disorders affect- ing 49% and 37% of patients, respectively (Online Supplementary Table S2). The great majority of all patients in the study (including 2L patients) used concomitant medication during the study (R-B, 96%; R-Clb, 94%).

During the study, 11/121 (9.1%) patients treated with R-B and 22/120 (18.3%) patients treated with R-Clb had a documented intake of any new leukemia treatment. Due to the low numbers, the median time to next leukemic treatment could not be calculated for either treatment arm (log-rank test for com- parison between treatment arms: P=0.037). MRD data were available for 45/50 patients (90%) who had a CR based on the investigator’s assessment and 182/241 patients (76%) overall. BM aspirates were avail- able for 42/45 patients (93%) and 145/182 patients (80%), respectively. MRD-negativity rates at the confirmation-of- response visit (ITT population) were higher for R-B than for R-Clb (41% vs. 13%; Table 3). In 1L patients with a CR after C6, MRD-negativity rates at the confirmation-of- response visit were higher in the R-B group than in the R- Clb group (66% vs. 36%). A similar pattern was seen in those with a CR or PR according to investigator’s assess- ment (53% vs. 18%). Efficacy results in 2L patients are presented in the Online Supplementary Information. Safety Safety results are presented for the pooled population (1L and 2L patients). AEs were similar between arms (R-B, 98%; R-Clb, 97%; Table 4). The most common AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) were ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ (R-B, 75%; R-Clb, 64%); the most com- monly reported AE was neutropenia (R-B, 56%; R-Clb, 49%). ',\n"," 'AEs in the SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue dis- orders’ were more frequent in the R-B versus R-Clb arm (36% vs. 23%), driven by a higher incidence of rash (16% vs. 5%). Grade ≥3 AEs were higher with R-B (75%) than R-Clb (64%), mainly due to a higher incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) of the SOC ‘infections and infestations’. The most common grade ≥3 AEs were of the SOC ‘blood and lym- phatic system disorders’ (R-B, 56%; R-Clb, 47%). SAEs were experienced by 41% (R-B) and 32% (R-Clb) of patients, and were most frequently of the SOC ‘infections and infestations’ (R-B, 19%; R-Clb, 8%; Table 4). Rituximab-related AEs were experienced by 81% (R-B) and 73% (R-Clb) of patients. B/Clb-related AEs were reported for 92% (R-B) and 80% (R-Clb) of patients. Drug- related AEs (rituximab, B, and Clb) were most commonly of the SOC ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’. AEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were experienced by 18% (R-B) and 11% (R-Clb) of patients. AEs leading to dis- continuation of B or Clb were reported for 19% and 18% of patients, respectively. In 1L patients, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were experienced by 22 R-B patients (18%) and 14 R-Clb patients (12%). Overall, 65 patients died (R-B, n=30, 17%; R-Clb, n=35, 20%) due to CLL (R-B, n=14, 8%; R-Clb, n=20, 11%) and AEs (R-B, n=16, 9%; R-Clb, n=14, 8%). Cause of death was missing for one patient (R-Clb arm). AEs leading to death were infection (n=4 per arm), acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1 per arm), other neoplasm (R-Clb, n=1), and other causes (R-B, n=11; R-Clb, n=8). Treatment-related AEs leading to death included thrombocytopenia, neutropenic sepsis and febrile neutropenia (n=1 each) in the 1L population and multi-organ failure, pneumonia, acute myeloid leukemia and sepsis (n=1 each) in the 2L population. Discussion R-FC is the standard 1L treatment for medically-fit patients with CLL. However, this regimen can cause sig- nificant myelosuppression and high rates of early and late infections, especially in elderly patients who may have comorbidities and be considered ineligible for fludarabine- based treatment. In MABLE, the efficacy and safety of R- B and R-Clb were investigated in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. B is an established treatment for CLL, and a previous phase III study of B versusClb in treatment-naïve patients demonstrated improved CR rates and median PFS with B. ',\n"," '12,13 R combined with chemotherapeutic agents pro- longs OS in previously untreated, medically fit CLL patients. 16,17  In unfit patients, survival was improved by the addition of G to Clb. Among 1L patients in MABLE, the rates of CR and of CR with MRD-negativity were higher for R-B than for R- Clb. ORRs were similar in the two arms. Whereas the CR rate in 1L R-Clb patients in MABLE (9%) was comparable with that in R-Clb patients in the phase III CLL11 study (7%), the ORR for R-Clb-treated patients was higher in MABLE than in CLL11 (86% vs. 58%). Two explanations for this might be the different Clb doses used (MABLE, 10 -S. Michallet et al. 702 haematologica | 2018; 103(4) Table 3.

Earlier phase II studies in elderly CLL patients treated 1L with R-Clb reported CR rates of 10-17% and ORRs of 82-84%. ',\n"," '8,9 The CLL2M trial, a phase II study of CLL patients treated 1L with R-B, at the same B dosage as the current study, reported a CR rate of 23% and an ORR of 88%. In 1L patients in the study reported herein, the median PFS of 39.6 months in the R-B arm was significantly longer (by 10 months) than the value in the R-Clb arm. This result is similar to the median PFS of 43.2 months achieved in fit CLL patients treated with R-B in the CLL10 study, and is consistent with the findings of the CLL2M study, which enrolled fit and unfit 1L patients and report- ed a median event-free survival in R-B-treated patients of 33.9 months. The CLL2M study did not select patients by fitness, but a substantial proportion could be considered unfit based on age, Binet stage, and renal impairment. MABLE, 33% of the 1L patients were Binet stage C and the median age was 72 years. The PFS result in the R-Clb arm in MABLE was almost twice as long as that in CLL11 (29.9 vs. 15.4 months), however, as noted above, a direct comparison of these studies is limited by differences in Clb doses and patient fitness. In MABLE, 1L patients with CR had higher MRD-nega- tivity rates with R-B versus R-Clb, indicating a greater depth of response with R-B. Of note, MRD was assessed primarily in BM from patients with CR based on the investigator’s assessment, whereas in CLL11 and previous phase II studies, MRD was measured in peripheral blood ([PB] or BM) from all patients. 7,8,10 One phase II study reported a MRD-negativity rate of 12.5% (2/16 patients) using BM aspirates from R-Clb-treated patients who achieved a CR/unconfirmed CR. Median OS was not significantly different between treatment arms in 1L patients in MABLE and was not reached in previous phase II studies of R-B and R-Clb, 7-9  in the CLL11 and COMPLEMENT-1 studies. 11,19 At current follow-up reported for CLL11 and COMPLEMENT-1, no significant OS benefit was observed for G-Clb versus R-Clb or ofatumumab plus Clb (Ofa-Clb) versus Clb, respectively, 11,19 whereas a significant improvement was observed for G-Clb versusClb alone. Further observation is required to determine if there is an OS benefit with  G-Clb versusR-Clb or Ofa-Clb versusClb. ',\n"," 'Safety profiles (for pooled 1L and 2L patients) were sim- ilar for R-Clb and R-B, with no new or clinically relevant safety signals, and events were as expected for CLL patients receiving immunochemotherapy. 7-9  Incidences of all-grade AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs were sim- ilar across arms. Grade ≥3 AE incidence was slightly high- er with R-B versusR-Clb, driven by a higher incidence of Rituximab plus bendamustine or chlorambucil in CLL haematologica | 2018; 103(4) 703 Figure 2. Efficacy in 1L patients. (A) PFS and (B) OS.

Few patients in either arm dis- continued therapy due to AEs. Treatment withdrawal due to AEs was reported for 18% of patients receiving 1L R-B and 12% receiving R-Clb. As previously noted, the results of the CLL11 study show that, in unfit CLL patients, G-Clb was associated with higher response rates and longer PFS than R-Clb, with more frequent MRD eradication and an acceptable toxicity profile. In addition, current guidelines, (European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network), recommend Clb in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody as standard 1L therapy in unfit CLL patients. 20,21 However, in MABLE and previous studies, R-B was associated with a good response rate and improved PFS compared with R-Clb. Currently, evidence to guide the choice between R-B and G-Clb in 1L unfit patients with CLL is limited, although a recent meta- analysis of PFS and OS results in five studies showed a trend towards better efficacy for G-Clb than R-B; how- ever, the difference was not significant despite a signifi- cant difference between G-Clb and other comparators such as R-Clb, Ofa-Clb, Clb, and fludarabine. A random- ized trial comparing these combinations could resolve this question. Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Since we relied only on investigator assessments of tumor response to evaluate efficacy, and did not include assess- ments by an independent review committee, this might have introduced a potential bias in the efficacy results. Comparison of our results with those of other studies in CLL patients is potentially complicated because the selec- tion of patients based on fitness was based on a judgment made by the investigator that the patients were not eligi- ble for fludarabine, according to a set of pre-defined crite- -S.

However, a recent randomized study comparing the efficacy of ibruti- nib with Clb used an age cut-off of 65 years as the only criterion for selecting “older” patients, and did not carry out any assessment of comorbidities.

Indeed, these agents have shown promising efficacy when combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (including rituximab) in the relapsed/refractory CLL setting, 24-29  and are now being evaluated in 1L. Furthermore, additional safety data for 1L B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors are required. In March 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration alerted healthcare pro- fessionals about safety concerns with idelalisib when used in combination with rituximab or R-B in CLL and follicu- lar lymphoma. This was related to a high rate of viral and fungal infections that led the sponsor to discontinue six trials. However, given the economic burden associated with new agents and the fact that BCR inhibitors are not yet available in many European countries, immunochemother- apy combinations are likely to continue to be valuable treat- ment options for 1L patients with CLL. In conclusion, in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients, 1L R-B treatment significantly improved CR rates and medi- an PFS versusR-Clb, and increased MRD-negativity rates, with no new safety signals reported. R-B may be a valu- able 1L option for fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients and this combination continues to be widely used in clinical practice in Europe, reinforcing the interest of this large randomized study.

Despite  multiple treatment options available, responses in relapsed  disease are typically incomplete and are of relatively short  duration, and therapy is commonly complicated by cytope- nias and infections [1 – 3]. A more targeted approach in the  treatment of CLL could have the benefi t of high effi cacy with  low toxicity. Th e phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is  known to be a central mechanism by which CLL lymphocytes  survive and evade apoptosis. Constitutive activation of  AKT promotes CLL lymphocyte survival, while inhibition of  the AKT pathway induces CLL lymphocyte death [4]. Because  of these fi ndings, we sought to evaluate the eff ect of pharma- cologic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells. Perifosine is an alkylphospholipid that was shown to  inhibit phosphorylation of AKT by blocking the membrane  localization of AKT and thus interfering with the interac- tion of PI3K with AKT [5]. ',\n"," 'myeloma and Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia,  two B-cell malignancies [6 – 8]. In these B-cell lymphoprolif- erative disorders, effi cacy of perifosine was linked to its inhi- bition of signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because  CLL is a related B-cell malignancy that relies on the PI3K/ AKT pathway for viability, we hypothesized that perifosine  would have anti-CLL activity mediated through its inhibition  of AKT phosphorylation. Materials and methods  Clinical study design and subjects  Patients with histologically confi rmed relapsed or refrac- tory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who  required therapy were eligible for this phase II clinical trial  at Duke University Medical Center. Th e primary objective  was to evaluate the response rate of perifosine in patients  with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. Secondary objec- tives included assessing toxicity, evaluating overall survival  and event-free survival, and performing laboratory-based  correlates of clinical effi cacy. Eligibility criteria included age 18 years of age, Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  of 0 – 2, creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min, and aspartate  aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  and total bilirubin 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Abstract  Because of the importance of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase  (PI3K)/AKT pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we  evaluated in vitro cytotoxicity induced by perifosine, an AKT  inhibitor, in CLL lymphocytes and found that the mean 50%  eff ective dose (ED  ) was 313 nM. We then performed a phase  II trial of perifosine in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL  to assess response, outcomes, toxicity and ex vivo correlative  measures. After 3 months of treatment, six of eight patients  showed stable disease, one achieved a partial response and  one had progressive disease. Median event-free survival and  overall survival in all patients treated were 3.9 and 9.7 months. Adverse events included hematologic, infectious/fever, pain,  gastrointestinal and constitutional toxicities. Unexpectedly,  AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes from treated patients  was not correlated with response. Additionally, perifosine did  not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. Perifosine is cytotoxic to CLL cells in vitro , and largely induces  stabilized disease in vivo , with an AKT-independent mechanism.

Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, human immunode- fi ciency virus infection, concurrent severe medical or  psychiatric illness that could interfere with participation  in the clinical study, other malignancy within 3 years of  enrollment (excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer,  early stage prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cer- vix), prior allogeneic stem cell transplant with 2% donor  cell engraftment, signifi cant cardiovascular disease within  6 months, active autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune  thrombocytopenia, prolymphocytic leukemia or Richter  transformation. Prognostic markers and disease status were assessed  prior to initiation of therapy. Th ese included bone marrow  biopsy and aspirate, cross-sectional imaging of the neck,  chest, abdomen and pelvis, immunoglobulin heavy chain  variable (IGHV) gene mutation status determination, fl ow  cytometry for ZAP70 and CD38, interphase cytogenetics for  11q23, 12cen, 13q14 and 17p13 using fl uorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetics. Prog- nostic markers were determined by clinical laboratories at  Duke University [9], but in rare cases of missing data, some  prognostic markers were measured in the research labora- tory as described in the “ In vitro evaluation of perifosine ”  section below. Th e Duke University institutional review board (IRB)  approved the protocol and all study participants provided  written informed consent. Th e clinical study was registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00873457). Target accrual was  based on the estimated patient accrual rate at our single  institution as well as estimates for statistical confi dence. Th ere was no offi cial stopping rule or interim analysis,  although the protocol stipulated consideration of stopping  the clinical trial early if there were one or less responders  in the fi rst 12 accrued patients. Perifosine was supplied by  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Clinical study treatment plan  Perifosine was administered at 50 mg orally, twice daily on a  continuous treatment schedule, for up to six 28-day cycles. Patients were instructed to take perifosine with food. Dose  modifi cations were prescribed for persistent grade 2 and  for grade 3/4 adverse events. For persistent grade 2 adverse  events, perifosine was reduced to once daily dosing. ',\n"," 'For  grade 3/4 adverse events, perifosine was held for at least  1 week, and restarted once the toxicity improved to grade 1  or returned to baseline. Supportive care, including antibiotic  prophylaxis, antiemetic prophylaxis, diarrhea management  and hyperuricemia prophylaxis, were at the discretion of the  treating physician. Patients were followed monthly, with physical exami- nations, blood counts and manual leukocyte diff erential. Interim responses were evaluated after three cycles of  therapy with evaluation and comparison of blood counts  and cross-sectional imaging to those obtained prior to  therapy initiation. Final responses were evaluated after six  cycles of therapy. Response to therapy was classifi ed based  on the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic  Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria [10]. Toxicities were documented  according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version  3.0). Hematologic toxicities were also evaluated using the  iwCLL criteria [10]. Ex vivo correlative studies  Laboratory-based correlative studies were performed to  evaluate ex vivo CLL lymphocytes for biomarkers associ- ated with clinical response. For cytotoxicity, apoptosis and  immunoblot assays, CLL cells were isolated and purifi ed, as  described previously [11]. For fl ow cytometry assessment of  phosphorylated protein expression, we used whole blood. Plasma was used to measure perifosine concentration. Between 10 and 50 mL of blood was collected prior to initia- tion of therapy (cycle 1 day 1), on cycle 1 day 8, on cycle 4 day  1 and at completion of perifosine. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using the MTS [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2- (4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous  One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega). We evaluated  CLL cell apoptosis and death using a caspase-3 activity assay  (EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit #2 - Z-DEVD-R110 Substrate;  Life Technologies) and by fl ow cytometric measurement of  Annexin V – fl uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (BD Biosci- ences) expression and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion  (Sigma). Assays were performed as described previously [12]  and according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. We performed phospho-fl ow assays on whole blood col- lected from patients during the clinical study. Six hundred  microliters of whole blood was incubated with BD Lyse/Fix  Buff er, washed with phosphate buff ered saline (PBS) and  permeabilized with BD Perm Buff er III. ',\n"," 'Up to 1 10 6 cells  were combined with antibodies listed below for 30 min and  resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Flow cytom- etry was performed as described below. When adequate CLL lymphocytes were available, we  assessed total AKT and phosphorylated AKT using immu- noblots. Cells were lysed with RIPA buff er (Cell Signaling  Technology), cOmplete Mini ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied  Science) and Tyr and Ser/Th r phosphatase inhibitor cock- tail set (Millipore). Cell lysates (50 μ g for phospho-AKT and  20 μ g for AKT) were electorphoresed and blotted onto poly- vinylidene fl uoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were  blocked and incubated with phospho-AKT (S473) rabbit  polyclonal and AKT rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies  (Cell Signaling Technology). Th e immunoblots were then  incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG), horse- radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody (Cell  Signaling Technology) and SuperSignal (Th ermo Scien- tifi c). We used phospho- or non-phospho-AKT cell extracts  (Cell Signaling Technology) as a positive/normalization  control across immunoblots. Band density was quantifi ed  and expressed as a ratio of phospho-AKT band density to  total AKT band density, and normalized to the cell extract  control band density. Plasma perifosine concentration was determined at  the University of Wisconsin using a reversed-phase liquid  chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry method  described previously [13]. Perifosine in CLL 1069 In vitro evaluation of perifosine  CLL lymphocytes were obtained from patients followed at  the Duke University and the Durham VA Medical Center. Th ese patients were enrolled in IRB-approved research pro- tocols to collect clinical data and primary patient samples. Patients ’ charts were reviewed to collect and/or calculate  certain prognostic information, such as Rai stage at diagno- sis, lymphocyte doubling time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  and β  -microglobulin (B2M). Isolation and purifi cation of CLL lymphocytes and deter- mination of molecular prognostic markers were performed,  as described previously [11]. Perifosine was obtained from  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Cytotoxicity was measured after  a 3-day incubation of primary CLL cells with serial dilutions  of perifosine in Hybridoma SFM medium (Gibco) using the  MTS assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Pro- liferation Assay, Promega) and fractional cytotoxicity was  determined, all as described before [14]. ',\n"," 'Th ereafter, dose – response curves and the concentration eff ective at killing  50% of CLL cells (ED  ) were calculated. Phospho-fl ow cytometry was performed to determine  the intracellular content of phosphorylated protein kinases  in purifi ed CLL lymphocytes. CLL cells were evaluated at  a 0 h time point and after 1 h of incubation in serum-free  medium with or without anti-IgM (20 μ g/mL goat anti- human IgM; Southern Biotech), perifosine (10 μ M) and/ or LY294002 (25 μ M; Invitrogen). Th e concentration of  perifosine was chosen based on in vitro testing in multiple  myeloma cells [7]. Th e anti-IgM was added for the last  10 min of incubation. One million cells per condition were  fi xed with BD Phosfl ow Lyse/Fix Buff er III (BD Biosciences)  and stored at 80 ° C. After thawing all replicate samples,  the cells were permeabilized with BD Phosfl ow Perm  Buff er (BD Biosciences) and were stained with antibod- ies to CD5, CD20, CD19 and a phosphoprotein, as out- lined in Supplementary Table I available online at http:// informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013. 824080. Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickin- son LSRII fl ow cytometer. Analysis of fl ow cytometry results  was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.). CLL cells were identifi ed based on forward and side scat- ter characteristics as well as co-expression of CD5, CD19 and  CD20. Phosphoprotein content was evaluated using a “ fl uo- rescence minus one ” (FMO) approach. For each experiment,  the mean fl uorescence intensity (MFI) in the PE channel  without the test antibody was subtracted from the MFI with  a test antibody. For in vitro experiments, the change in MFI  under each experimental condition was normalized to base- line MFI using the equation: normalized MFI [(test MFI  FMO MFI)/(test MFI at time 0 FMO MFI)]. Statistical analysis  Patients completing three and six cycles of perifosine were  evaluated for responses. Event-free survival (EFS) was  defi ned as the time from initiation of perifosine to disease  progression, subsequent treatment or death. Overall survival  (OS) was defi ned as the time from initiation of perifosine to  death [10]. All treated patients were evaluated for toxicity,  EFS and OS. ',\n"," 'Kaplan – Meier analyses and graphs of EFS and OS were  performed using the survival package in R [15]. Follow-up  time was defi ned as time from start of therapy to death or  the current time (if still living). Dose – response curves and  evaluation of ED  were performed using the drc pack- age in R [16]. Statistical comparison of phospho-AKT in  CLL lymphocytes was performed using the paired t -test. Pearson ’ s correlation was used to evaluate for associations  between continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum  test or Kruskal – Wallis test were used to assess for associa- tions between discrete variables and continuous variables,  respectively. A p -value of 0.05 was considered signifi cant. Th ese statistical analyses were performed in the statistical  environment R, version 2.11.1. Results  Perifosine induces in vitro CLL cell toxicity  Perifosine has previously been evaluated for its in vitro eff ect  on B-cell malignancies, such as multiple myeloma [6 – 8]. We evaluated the extent to which perifosine induces in vitro  cytotoxicity in purifi ed CLL lymphocytes, since activation  of the PI3K/AKT pathway is known to promote cell survival  in this malignancy [4]. Twenty-six primary CLL cell samples  obtained from patients not undergoing therapy were tested  for cell viability using the colorimetric MTS assay after  incubation with a range of concentrations of perifosine. the samples with evaluable data, 12 samples had mutated  IGHV, while 11 samples were unmutated. Twenty samples  had low CD38 ( 30%) expression and six samples had high  CD38 expression. Eleven samples had low ZAP70 ( 20%)  expression and 15 samples had high ZAP70 expression. Using the D ö hner classifi cation for interphase cytogenetics  [17], eight samples had 13q deletion, six had normal cyto- genetics, three had trisomy 12, four had 11q deletion and  two had 17p deletion. As seen in Figure 1, perifosine induces CLL lymphocyte  toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean ED  313 74 nM (standard error). ',\n"," 'Th e calculated in vitro ED  perifosine in these samples had no signifi cant correlation to  molecular prognostic markers or to other prognostic mark- ers such as Rai stage, lymphocyte doubling time, serum LDH  or serum B2M level (Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal – Wallis  test for discrete variables; Pearson ’ s correlation test for  continuous variables). Th us, perifosine appears to induce  cytotoxicity in vitro in CLL cells throughout the spectrum of  biologically aggressive or indolent markers. Patient characteristics in CLL perifosine clinical trial  Because of the encouraging results demonstrating that  sub-micromolar concentrations of perifosine induce cyto- toxicity in CLL lymphocytes in vitro , we initiated a phase  II clinical trial to evaluate the effi cacy and toxicity of 50 mg  of perifosine administered orally twice daily for 6 months  in relapsed and/or refractory CLL/SLL. Th is dosing sched- ule was selected based on results from a phase II study of  single agent perifosine in Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia  [6]. Our goal accrual was 30 evaluable patients. However,  we discontinued the study early because of low objective  1070 D. Friedman et al. patients treated with perifosine, four had normal interphase  FISH cytogenetics, one had 13q deletion, two had trisomy  12, one had 11q deletion and eight had 17p deletion (D ö hner  classifi cation). Of 14 patients ’ CLL cells that could be tested  for conventional cytogenetics, 11 had complex and/or addi- tional karyotypic abnormalities not detected by the FISH  assay. Th us, either by clinical history or by molecular prog- nostic markers, patients with CLL enrolled in the perifosine  clinical trial had high-risk and aggressive disease. Safety and dose reductions  All treated patients were evaluated for toxicity. Th e adverse  and serious adverse events are shown in Table II. Th e most  common non-hematologic and non-infectious adverse  events were gastrointestinal, such as nausea (three events),  vomiting (two events), diarrhea (six events) and dehydra- tion (four events, one grade 3).

Perifosine therapy was  associated with metabolic toxicities, such as hyperglycemia  (four events, one grade 3), hyperbilirubinemia (two events,  one grade 3) and hyponatremia (two events, one grade 4). Th ere were 10 episodes of musculoskeletal pain (all grades  1 and 2). ',\n"," 'With regard to hematologic toxicities, 12 patients  began the study with Rai stage 3 or 4 CLL, so baseline anemia  and thrombocytopenia were common. Using iwCLL criteria  to grade hematologic toxicity [10], eight events of grade 1 and  2 anemia occurred, and 16 events of grade 1 and 2 thrombo- cytopenia occurred. Eleven events of neutropenia occurred  (two grade 3 events). Nine episodes of grade 3 or 4 infection  or febrile neutropenia were documented, but there was only  one microbiologically confi rmed infection that began during  perifosine treatment ( Escherichia coli sepsis). Two patients required dose reductions and delays due to  toxicity. One patient developed neutropenia, and perifosine  was held for 1 week then restarted at daily dosing. Another  patient developed anemia and required transfusions, and  perifosine was held for 2 weeks, then restarted at daily  dosing. We noted other eff ects of perifosine. Th ese included an  improvement in thrombocytopenia (isolated from changes  in hemoglobin or leukocyte count) in three patients, rash in  two patients, and reduction in malignant pleural eff usions in  one patient. Patient response to perifosine therapy  At a median follow-up time of 290 days (range 19 – 1142  days), 15 patients had died and one remains alive. As seen  in Figure 2, by 1 year of initiation of the perifosine study, all  treated patients progressed, received subsequent therapy or  died. Median EFS was 119 days (3.9 months), and median OS  was 290 days (9.7 months). Responses are outlined in Table III. Eight patients did  not complete 3 months of therapy. Of the eight patients who  were evaluated at 3 months, six had stable disease, one had  a partial response and one had progression of disease. Only  one patient completed 6 months of therapy, and had stable  disease at the conclusion of therapy. Early discontinuation of  therapy was most often due to insuffi cient response (56%) or  disease progression/transformation (19%). Other clinical trials of novel agents that inhibit the PI3K/ AKT pathway in CLL have noted increasing lymphocyto- sis accompanied by a reduction of lymph node size [18],  thought to be due to redistribution from the lymph node  microenvironment to the blood [19]. ',\n"," 'In six patients, we also  saw a rise in circulating leukocyte count. Th is was accompa- nied by an initial reduction in palpable lymphadenopathy  in four patients, while the remaining two did not have pal- pable lymph nodes at the start of treatment. In one patient,  this initial increase in lymphocytosis was accompanied by  a fever, reduction in serum LDH and resolution of thrombo- cytopenia. By 3 months of therapy, this patient had progres- sion of lymphadenopathy on computed tomography (CT)  scan and a reduction in circulating CLL cells. Correlative studies in CLL perifosine clinical trial  As a secondary aim, we measured ex vivo apoptosis, cytotox- icity and phosphorylation of AKT in CLL cells obtained from  patients undergoing therapy with perifosine. We hypothe- sized that in patients responding to perifosine therapy, there  would be induction of CLL cell apoptosis and inhibition of  AKT phosphorylation.

',\n"," 'Perifosine in CLL 1073 Discussion  In the phase II trial assessing the effi cacy of perifosine as a  single agent for CLL therapy, we have found that perifosine  mainly stabilizes disease in a heavily pretreated and highly  refractory population of patients with CLL, and that this  eff ect is not associated with in vivo alterations in AKT phos- phorylation of CLL lymphocytes. In our laboratory-based  experiments, we demonstrated that perifosine has cytotoxic  activity against CLL lymphocytes in vitro that is independent  of inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Despite observing in vitro cytotoxicity of CLL cells with  perifosine in the nanomolar range, we did not fi nd signifi - cant in vivo clinical responses. Th is discrepancy could be  due to experimental conditions that may not fully represent  the in vivo setting. For example, when fetal bovine serum  (10%) was added to standard medium, the mean ED  rose  to 11 1.5 μ M (standard error; n 3), implying that protein  binding may diminish perifosine ’ s activity. Notably, the  plasma concentration reached after 1 week of therapy (4042  ng/mL) is equivalent to 8.75 μ M, a lower concentration than  this in vitro ED  result. Even if higher doses are necessary to  induce clinical responses, such an approach has previously  been demonstrated to cause greater toxicities (specifi cally  gastrointestinal and fatigue) [20]. More rapid achievement  of steady state concentrations can be achieved with loading  doses, but are associated with dose-limiting toxicities, espe- cially in the loading period [22]. In the phase II study of peri- fosine in Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia, 43% of patients  required dose reductions from 150 to 100 mg/day due to tox- icities [6]. Th us, known toxicities limited our dosing plan. A high-risk patient population with few treatment options  was treated in the trial. Th e oral administration of therapy and  the low incidence of cytopenias in other perifosine clinical tri- als attracted patients who were older and had more advanced  disease. Notably, most patients achieved disease stabiliza- tion with perifosine after progressing on other highly active  therapeutic regimens and other clinical trials, including fl u- darabine, bendamustine and fl avopiridol. Discontinuation of  We also assessed plasma perifosine concentration at the  specifi ed sample collection time points. ',\n"," 'As seen in Figure  3(D), after 1 week of perifosine treatment, patients reached  the expected plasma concentration for the dose based on  prior phase I studies [20]. Th e median concentration at that  time was 4042 ng/mL. For patients continuing on therapy  with subsequent blood collection, the median perifosine  concentration was 6058 ng/mL. Th ere was no correlation  between plasma perifosine concentration and clinical  responses or adverse events. In vitro cytotoxicity by perifosine is not related  to inhibition of AKT phosphorylation  Given prior reports documenting that perifosine inhibits  AKT phosphorylation and the PI3K/AKT pathway in multiple  myeloma [7], it was unexpected that perifosine treatment did  not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes in the  clinical trial. Th erefore, we performed in vitro experiments  to directly evaluate perifosine-induced suppression of AKT  phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. CLL cells up- regulate signaling via the PI3K/AKT pathway upon stimula- tion of the B-cell receptor by IgM cross-linking [Figure 4(A)]. We evaluated AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells after IgM  cross-linking with no drug compared to that with the addition  of perifosine or LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway  [21]. LY294002 signifi cantly decreased AKT phosphorylation  (pS473) in fi ve CLL samples after IgM cross-linking, whereas  perifosine did not [Figure 4(A)]. We observed no signifi cant  change in AKT phosphorylation with either drug without IgM  cross-linking (paired t -test, data not shown). Despite having  no eff ect on AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells, perifosine did  induce cytotoxicity in these samples tested, with ED  values  ranging from 578 nM to 1.545 μ M. Interestingly, we found that perifosine signifi cantly  increased phosphorylation of MEK in CLL lymphocytes  [Figure 4(B)], similar to fi ndings previously reported in  multiple myeloma cell lines [7]. Th ese fi ndings underscore  the diff erential eff ects of perifosine across diff erent types of  malignant B-cells.  0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Baseline IgM IgM + LY294002 IgM + Perifosine p = 0.042 p = 0.002 (A) (B) Baseline IgM IgM + LY294002 IgM + Perifosine p = 0.018 Figure 4.

Statistical signifi cance is  determined with paired t -test. IgM cross-linking induces phosphorylation of AKT. AKT phosphorylation is signifi cantly abrogated by addition of  LY294002, as expected.

However,  adding perifosine to anti-IgM signifi cantly increases MEK phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes compared to IgM cross-linking alone. 1074 D. Friedman et al.

Given  the impressive responses to PI3K-delta isoform inhibitors in  relapsed CLL [18], the limited clinical effi cacy of perifosine  precludes its further development in this setting. Overall, perifosine was well tolerated. Notable non- hematologic and non-infectious toxicities were gastroin- testinal (nausea, diarrhea, dehydration) and pain (mostly  musculoskeletal), which were typically grade 1 or 2 and were  anticipated based on clinical evaluations of perifosine in  other malignancies [8,23]. Th ere was a varied eff ect of peri- fosine on hematologic parameters: in some cases cytopenias  improved dramatically, while in others, profound throm- bocytopenia and anemia requiring transfusions occurred. Fevers and infections did occur, but it is unclear whether  these were due to underlying immunosuppression or a direct  eff ect of perifosine. In one case, fever coincided with initia- tion of perifosine and the improvement of anemia, thrombo- cytopenia and neutropenia, suggesting that it may have been  due to therapy itself, not an infection. Perifosine has been found to have a variety of mecha- nisms of action independent of its eff ect on AKT phospho- rylation [24 – 27]. Th ese include alterations of membrane  lipid rafts and associated death receptors (such as tumor  necrosis factor [TNF]-related apoptosis-inducing ligand  [TRAIL]-receptor 1 and 2), induction of apoptosis via sup- pression of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, inhibition of  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and  induction of autophagy. Other cellular eff ects of perifosine  include induction of the mitogen activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of MEK [7],  which we also noted in our experiments. ',\n"," 'We did not evalu- ate whether these other potential mechanisms explain the  perifosine-induced in vitro cytotoxicity observed in cul- tured CLL cells. Th ese series of experiments, while not yielding a novel  therapeutic agent for CLL, do add to growing opportunities  for ex vivo monitoring of pharmacodynamic endpoints in  leukemia [18,28]. Th rough fl ow cytometry of whole blood,  we could evaluate known surface markers of CLL, as well as  phosphorylation of various members of second messenger  systems, using small numbers of circulating CLL cells. Th is is  important, as patients with CLL may paradoxically develop  lymphopenia with disease progression or after multiple  therapeutic regimens. Th us, in a series of translational experiments to evalu- ate perifosine in CLL, we demonstrated a cytotoxic eff ect in  vitro but only stabilization of disease in vivo . Th e eff ects we  observed were not associated with inhibition of AKT phos- phorylation, a mechanism previously reported for perifos- ine in other B-cell malignancies. Our study highlights the  value of incorporating ex vivo pharmacodynamic monitor- ing during therapy with novel agents for CLL to confi rm  inhibition of the target and/or to identify biomarkers of  therapy response.

Granulocyte  macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was added to  the regimen to determine whether it would improve treatment  effi cacy without increasing toxicity. High risk was defi ned as  at least one of the following: 17p13 - ; 11q22.3 - ; unmutated  IGHV (or use of VH3 – 21) together with elevated expression of  ZAP-70 and/or CD38. ',\n"," 'Treatment was subcutaneous GM-CSF  250 μ g Monday – Wednesday – Friday for 6 weeks from day 1,  subcutaneous alemtuzumab 3 mg – 10 mg – 30 mg from day 3  and then 30 mg Monday – Wednesday – Friday for 4 weeks, and  intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /week) for 4 weeks from day 8. Patients received standard supportive care and were monitored  weekly for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. Using standard  criteria, 31 (94%) patients responded to treatment, with nine  (27%) complete responses (one with persistent cytopenia) and  nine (27%) nodular partial responses. Median progression-free  survival was 13.0 months and time to next treatment was 33.5  months. No patient died during treatment, seven (21%) had  grade 3 – 4 toxicities attributable to treatment, and 10 (30%) had  CMV viremia. Addition of GM-CSF to therapy with alemtuzumab  and rituximab decreased treatment effi cacy and increased the  rate of CMV reactivation compared to a historical control. Keywords: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia , high risk ,  early treatment , alemtuzumab , rituximab , GM-CSF  gene ( IGHV mutation) [2,3], and the expression of CD38 [3]  and ZAP-70 [4]. Th ose patients in whom interphase fl uores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects 17p13 deletions  (17p - ) or 11q22.3 deletions (11q - ) have a signifi cantly poorer  prognosis [1]. Use of unmutated IGHV ( 2% diff erence from  germline sequence) [2,3] and use of VH3 – 21 irrespective of  mutation status [5] are associated with a poorer prognosis. Patients with unmutated IGHV are reported to have a signifi - cantly worse prognosis if CLL cells express CD38 or ZAP-70  [6,7]. Defi ning high-risk earlier-stage CLL in asymptomatic  patients is now feasible, and the challenge is to develop  highly eff ective low-toxicity therapy for this population. Th e current standard of care is to treat patients with CLL  only when they have progressive disease, because conven- tional treatment is not curative, and previous randomized  studies using only chemotherapy showed no survival advan- tage for early treatment [8 – 10]. Fit patients with progressive  CLL are now usually treated with chemoimmunotherapy  (purine analog, cyclophosphamide and rituximab), which  achieves high response rates, prolonged response duration  and increased overall survival [11 – 13]. ',\n"," 'All patients required an Eastern Coopera- tive Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 – 2 and  adequate organ function (serum creatinine 1.5 upper  limit of normal [UNL], total bilirubin 3.0 UNL and serum  aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 3.0 UNL). Exclusion  criteria included any evidence of active autoimmune disease  or active primary malignancy requiring treatment or limiting  expected survival to 2 years. Therapy  Patients were treated for 6 weeks. GM-CSF 250 μ g/day  was given subcutaneously three times a week (Monday – Wednesday – Friday) starting on day 1 of treatment and con- tinued for a total of 6 weeks. Patients received subcutaneous  alemtuzumab with dose escalation (3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg) on  days 3 – 5 of the fi rst week of therapy as tolerated, and then  received 30 mg/day Monday – Wednesday – Friday for the  next 4 weeks. After the fi rst week of therapy, alemtuzumab  could be self-administered at home at the patient ’ s discre- tion. Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 intravenously) was given on  day 8 and then weekly for a total of four doses. Th e fi rst dose  of alemtuzumab and all doses of rituximab were premedi- cated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Patients  received allopurinol (300 mg/day) on days 2 – 15 of therapy. All  patients received prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia  and reactivation of herpes simplex and varicella zoster dur- ing treatment and then for an additional 6 months. Patients  were monitored for CMV reactivation using polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) for viral DNA weekly during treatment  and then monthly for 6 months, and treated whenever CMV  viremia was detected. Response evaluation  Patients were evaluated by physical examination and blood  testing weekly during treatment, then monthly for 6 months,  and then at 9 and 12 months after completing therapy. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 (http://ctep.cancer. gov/). Response to treatment was measured 2 months after  completion of therapy using standard NCI-WG96 criteria  [27]. ',\n"," 'However, these thera- pies can cause signifi cant toxicity and long-term complica- tions, and are considerably less eff ective in patients with p53  dysfunction [13,14]. Th us, early treatment of selected patients  with CLL with a lower burden of disease and high risk of dis- ease progression using eff ective low-toxicity therapy could  decrease exposure to DNA-damaging agents and the risk of  clonal evolution to more aggressive disease. We have previously reported a phase II trial using a  short course of alemtuzumab and rituximab for early treat- ment of patients with high-risk CLL [15]. Th is regimen was  selected because alemtuzumab and rituximab have discrete  targets and diff erent mechanisms of action [16,17], and the  addition of rituximab to alemtuzumab appears to improve  responses, compared to historical results, for patients with  relapsed/refractory CLL [18,19]. Early treatment of patients  GM-CSF in treatment of CLL 477 with high-risk CLL resulted in a 90% response rate, 37%  complete response (CR) rate, median duration of response  of 14.4 months and estimated median time to next treatment  of 4.4 years [15]. Th erapy was well tolerated, and although  cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in three (10%)  patients, only one patient had clinical disease [15]. However,  because of the limited duration of response, additional eff orts  are required to improve the effi cacy of this therapy. Phagocytosis by fi xed macrophages and antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by natural  killer (NK) cells, monocytes and neutrophils are important  mechanisms of action of both rituximab and alemtuzumab,  and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is important  for the activity of alemtuzumab [16,17,20,21]. Both alemtu- zumab and rituximab decrease the circulating neutrophil  count, and alemtuzumab can decrease circulating NK cells  and monocytes [15], while its eff ect on tissue macrophages  is not known. Th us, both alemtuzumab and rituximab could  inhibit ADCC by decreasing eff ector cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM- CSF) promotes proliferation and maturation of neutrophils  and monocytes, and increases diff erentiation of monocytes  to macrophages and dendritic cells [22]. GM-CSF has also  been reported to increase rituximab ADCC of CLL cells by  monocytes in vitro [23]. ',\n"," 'A phase II study using GM-CSF and  rituximab to treat patients with relapsed follicular B cell lym- phoma reported higher overall response and CR rates without  undue toxicity, compared to the historical experience [24]. In addition, limited experience of treatment of patients with  CLL with GM-CSF and rituximab suggests that this therapy is  well tolerated, and it did not have inferior effi cacy compared  to rituximab monotherapy [25]. Th e current published data  thus suggest that the addition of GM-CSF to monoclonal  antibody (mAb) therapy could be safe and eff ective. We hypothesized that treatment with GM-CSF could  increase eff ector cell activity, resulting in improved effi cacy  of therapy with alemtuzumab and rituximab in patients  with CLL. As the initial step in testing this hypothesis, we  conducted a phase II trial of early treatment of patients with  high-risk CLL with GM-CSF, alemtuzumab and rituximab. Th is study showed that the addition of GM-CSF decreased  treatment effi cacy and resulted in higher rates of CMV  reactivation compared to a historical experience with  alemtuzumab and rituximab alone. Methods and materials  Patient selection  Th e study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional  Review Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT00562328), and all patients provided written informed  consent. Sequential patients were evaluated in the Division  of Hematology at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Department  of Hematology/Oncology at Mayo Clinic Arizona from  January 2008 to February 2010. Eligibility required a diagno- sis of CLL by fl ow cytometry on peripheral blood [26], previ- ously untreated early to intermediate clinical stage disease  (Rai 0 – II) that did not fulfi ll criteria for treatment as defi ned  by the National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria  of 1996 (NCI-WG96) [27], and molecular markers predic- tive of a high risk of disease progression. High-risk disease  was defi ned as at least one of the following: (1) 17p13 - by  FISH analysis; (2) 11q22 - by FISH analysis; (3) unmutated  IGHV ( 2% sequence variation from germline) or use of  the VH3 – 21 gene segment irrespective of mutation status  together with expression of ZAP-70 ( 20% cells positive on  fl ow cytometry) and/or CD38 ( 30% cells positive on fl ow  cytometry) [15]. ',\n"," 'Patients dying without documentation of  disease progression were considered to have had tumor pro- gression at the time of their death, unless there was proof of  sustained response. Time to subsequent therapy was defi ned  as the time from the end of active treatment to the time that  subsequent therapy was initiated. Th e distribution of all  time-to-event endpoints was estimated using the method of  Kaplan – Meier [31]. Baseline information of patients enrolled  in this trial was compared to that of patients enrolled in  MC038G using two-sample t -tests (for continuous data) or χ 2  tests (for categorical data). Results  Th irty-three patients were enrolled and are described in  Table I. All patients met eligibility criteria, completed the  treatment regimen protocol, and were evaluated for response  and toxicity. Th e median follow-up for surviving patients  ( n 31) was 28 months (range 10 – 43). Toxicity  Th ere were no deaths during treatment, and seven (21%)  patients had severe (grade 3 – 4) adverse events at least pos- sibly related to treatment: neutropenia ( n 3), infections  ( n 4), dyspnea ( n 1), hypersensitivity reaction ( n 1)  and skin reactions ( n 2). Th e severe infections were febrile  neutropenia ( n 1), pneumonia ( n 1) and opportunistic  infections ( n 2), which included one patient with CMV  reactivation detailed below. In one of these patients, infec- tion resulted in a short delay in completing treatment.

Among the nine  patients who started valganciclovir therapy (900 mg every  12 h by mouth) within 24 h of the detection of viremia, there  were no signifi cant clinical consequences of CMV reactiva- tion. However, one patient had a multiple-day delay in fi lling  her prescription for valganciclovir because of logistical prob- lems, and she developed symptomatic CMV reactivation  requiring hospitalization and ganciclovir therapy. Th ere was  only one grade 2 injection site reaction. Responses to treatment  Th irty-one (94%, 95% confi dence interval [CI]: 80 – 99%)  patients responded to treatment, with eight (24%) CRs, one  complete response with persistent cytopenia (CRi) (with  subsequent normalization of blood counts), nine (27%)  nPRs and 13 (39%) PRs.

Th e role of treatment  with alemtuzumab in development of the diff use large B-cell  lymphoma cannot be determined. Alemtuzumab-induced  immunosuppression has been associated with the develop- ment of more aggressive lymphomas, but the reported cases  were EBV positive [32,33]. Th e absence of evidence of EBV  reactivation and the temporal sequence of the complica- tion suggest that this patient ’ s diff use large B-cell lymphoma  could have been present prior to initiation of therapy with  alemtuzumab. A second patient with 17p13 – CLL achieved  PR of 4 months ’ duration. He then failed treatment for pro- gressive disease with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide and  rituximab (FCR) and died from his CLL 10 months later. Eleven additional patients required subsequent treatment  and received FCR ( n 6), pentostatin, cyclophosphamide  and rituximab (PCR) ( n 1), bendamustine and rituximab  ( n 1), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and  prednisone ( n 2) and rituximab ( n 1). Neutrophil and monocyte counts  GM-CSF decreased treatment-induced neutropenia (Figure 3)  but not alemtuzumab-mediated monocytopenia (Figure 4),  compared to our previous study of early treatment of patients  with high-risk CLL with alemtuzumab and rituximab [15]. ',\n"," 'Testing for residual disease  BM biopsies of the six patients achieving a CR/CRi with no  morphological evidence of CLL were studied with IHC for  residual disease. Th e three patients with IHC-negative CR  had a longer PFS (not reached at 25 months). Serial high- sensitivity fl ow cytometry for MRD in blood was performed  during treatment and then until disease progression in  29 patients. Seventeen (59%) patients achieved at least one  negative MRD test during treatment, and 12 (41%) had nega- tive results after completion of therapy. However, only four  (14%) of these patients were still MRD-negative at 2 months  after completion of therapy, with two having evidence of resid- ual disease on IHC examination of the BM (PFS 19 months and  not reached at 19 months) and two having an IHC-negative BM  (PFS not reached at 25 months). Th e longest duration of MRD- negative status was 9 months after completion of therapy. Addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and rituximab  To assess whether GM-CSF improved the effi cacy of alemtu- zumab and rituximab for early treatment of high-risk CLL,  we compared the results of this trial (MC0785) to a preced- ing trial (MC038G) that used similar eligibility criteria [15]. As seen in Table II, there were signifi cantly more patients  on the MC0785 trial with unmutated IGHV . In contrast, the  higher number of patients on the MC038G with 17p13 – (30%  vs. 12%) did not represent a signifi cant diff erence ( p 0.12). Use of GM-CSF was associated with a signifi cantly higher  rate of CMV reactivation (30% vs. 3%, p 0.007), but only  one patient in each trial had symptomatic CMV reactivation  requiring hospitalization. Th ere were no other signifi cant  diff erences in toxicities. Use of GM-CSF was associated with  a similar overall response rate (94%, 95% CI: 80 – 99% vs. 90%,  95% CI: 73 – 98%) and PFS (13.0, 95% CI: 9.4 – NR vs. 11.6, 95%  CI: 7.2 – 19.3 months) (Figure 1), but lower CR rates (24%,  95% CI: 11 – 42% vs. 37%, 95% CI: 19 – 56%) and time to next  treatment (33.5, 95% CI: 25.5 – 37.6 vs. 43, 95% CI: 29.4 – 66.3  months) (Figure 2). ',\n"," 'Discussion  Early treatment of high-risk CLL could be benefi cial if the  highest-risk patients could be accurately identifi ed and  treated with safe and eff ective non-genotoxic therapy. this study we showed that the addition of GM-CSF did not  improve the effi cacy of alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy  for early treatment of high-risk CLL and increased the rate of  CMV reactivation. Th e rationale for using GM-CSF was to enhance ADCC by  increasing the effi cacy of monocyte – macrophage – dendritic  cells and preventing mAb-induced neutropenia. Although  neutrophil counts were well maintained, there was no  increase in circulating monocyte counts or treatment effi - cacy. GM-CSF was used at the dose recommended by the  manufacturers based on their experience in vaccine and  immunotherapy trials. A higher GM-CSF dose could have  480 C. Zent et al. Figure 4.

Median neutrophil counts ( 10 9 /L) were  signifi cantly higher for patients on MC0785 compared to MC038G for measurements at three time points during therapy with GM-CSF (marked by  vertical interrupted lines) at day 8 (3.5 vs. 2.7, p 0.001), day 22 (3.9 vs. 3.1, p 0.003) and day 29 (4.1 vs. 2.9, p 0.002) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). increased the circulating monocyte level but could also have  increased the side eff ects of malaise, myalgia and fevers. Use of GM-CSF could have adversely altered monocyte – macrophage function in the patients treated in this study. ',\n"," 'Patients with CLL have recently been shown to have increased  levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are media- tors of cancer tolerance [34], and production of monocyte- derived survival factors such as soluble CD14, which have  been shown to increase CLL cell survival in vitro [35]. We have previously shown that patients enrolled in this  study had an increased baseline percentage of immu- nosuppressive CD14 monocytes with reduced human  leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression compared  to healthy controls, and higher percentages of these  CD14 HLA-DR lo/neg cells predicted signifi cantly shorter  PFS [36]. Th ese data suggest that GM-CSF could stimulate an  GM-CSF in treatment of CLL 481 Table II.

',\n"," 'immunosuppressive monocyte – macrophage – dendritic cell  response in patients with CLL that decreases ADCC and thus  impairs the response to alemtuzumab and rituximab. Th e use of GM-CSF could decrease the risk of infection. However, we observed a three-fold increase in the rate of  CMV reactivation compared to the previous trial [15]. Th is  fi nding is compatible with previous reports suggesting that  G-CSF could increase the risk of CMV reactivation in patients  with CLL treated with alemtuzumab [37]. Th e mechanism of  increased risk of CMV activation in patients with CLL treated  with these growth factors is unknown. Compared to patients  on the previous trial (MC038G), patients treated with GM- CSF had a lower rate of grade 3 – 4 neutropenia (9% vs. 17%),  but there was no decrease in grade 3 – 4 infections (12% vs.  6%). Th e addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and rituximab  therapy does not appear to be useful in decreasing the risk of  infection in this patient population. Sensitive assays for residual CLL could be useful in  determining the extent of response to treatment. In this  study, most patients had a negative sensitive fl ow cytometry  assay for MRD in the blood during treatment, but this did  not predict the quality or duration of response to treatment. Our data thus support the previously published fi nding that  MRD testing in the peripheral blood during and for the fi rst  3 months after alemtuzumab therapy is not a reliable method  of determining response to treatment [38]. In contrast,  patients with CR/CRi and negative IHC examinations  for residual CLL cells in the BM had the most durable  responses to treatment. Th ese data support previous reports  that MRD testing in the bone marrow during and within 3  months of completion of therapy is predictive of response  to treatment for regimens using alemtuzumab [38]. How- ever, the small number of patients in our study precludes  any defi nitive conclusions about the clinical utility of these  assays. Th e results of this trial show that the addition of GM-CSF  to the combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab does not  increase the effi cacy of alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy.

Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most com- mon leukemia in Western countries (1). It is estimated that there will be 15,720 new cases of CLL and 4,600 deaths because of CLL in 2014 in the United States (2). CLL is predominant in older individuals with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years. CLL has a variable natural historywitha5-yearrelativesurvivalrateofapproximate- ly 82% (3). CLL is characterized by increasing levels of clonal lym- phocytesintheblood,bonemarrow,andlymphatictissues (4). The diagnosis of CLL requires at least 5 109 B lymphocytes/L (5,000/mL) in the peripheral blood and confirmation of clonality by flow cytometry. CLL cells coexpresstheT-cellantigenCD5andB-cellsurfaceantigens CD19, CD20, and CD23 (5). Approved therapies for CLL include chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, alemtuzumab, benda- mustine, ofatumumab, and rituximab. For previously untreated patients with progressive CLL, recommended treatment regimens primarily consist of chemoimmu- notherapies.However,inpatientswithcoexistingmedical conditions, often including the elderly, aggressive treat- ment regimens are poorly tolerated (6). Allogeneic stem- cell transplantation is the only potentially curative treat- ment for CLL (7).

Toxicology studies were conducted using cynomolgus monkeys. Obinutuzumab binds human and cynomolgus monkeyCD20withsimilaraffinity.Repeat-dosetoxicology studies of up to 26 weeks’ duration using i.v. administra- tion of obinutuzumab or 4 weeks’ duration using s.c. administration were conducted. Toxicities observed from repeat-dose studies were consistent with the intended pharmacology of obinutuzumab or were the apparent resultofcross-speciesimmunogenicityeffects.Theprimary effects of obinutuzumab included hypersensitivity reac- tions and marked decreases in circulating B cells, with corresponding lymphoid tissue B-cell depletion in the spleenandlymphnodes.Transientnaturalkillercellreduc- tions were also observed, as were opportunistic infections secondary to immunosuppression. Administration of obinutuzumab to pregnant monkeys duringgestationwasassociatedwithcompletedepletionof B lymphocytes in infants. Obinutuzumab did not affect embryo–fetaldevelopment,parturition,postnatalsurvival, orthegrowthanddevelopmentofinfants.Obinutuzumab crosses the blood–placental barrier and is secreted in the milk of pregnant monkeys. Because of the depletion of B cells and possible opportunistic infections, use of obinu- tuzumab during pregnancy is not recommended. Clinical Pharmacology The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for obi- nutuzumab were derived using a population-based phar- macokinetic (pop-PK) analysis. The geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution of obinutuzumab is approximately 3.8 L (23%).

Subsequent premedications could be reduced in the absence of an infusion reaction. Consideration was given to holding antihypertensive agents before and throughout the infusion because infusion reactions sometimes includ- edhypotension.Infusionreactionsweremanagedbyinter- rupting or reducing the infusion rate and administering concomitant medications such as steroids and antihista- mines. Upon resolution of symptoms, the infusion was resumed at one-half the previous rate. Obinutuzumab was tobeadministeredatalocationwithimmediatelyavailable emergency resuscitation equipment. Patientswithahightumorburden(WBC 25 109/Lor bulky lymphadenopathy) were to receive adequate hydra- tion and antihyperuricemics before the initiation of treat- ment for prophylaxis of tumor lysis syndrome.

A CT scan was per- formed in patients who had achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response 2 to 3 months after end of treat- ment. In patients who had a CR (or cytopenic CR), a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were obtained. A CT scan was alsoperformedwhenprogressionofdiseasewasdetectedby physical examination. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free sur- vival(PFS)basedoninvestigator’sassessment.However,the regulatory decision was based on independent review com- mittee(IRC)–assessedPFS.TheIRCwascomposedofapanel of CLL experts (each patient reviewed by two reviewers and one adjudicator if required) who assessed response and progressionbasedonperipheralbloodcounts,bonemarrow biopsy results, reports of physical examination, and radiol- ogy reports. Secondary efficacy endpoints included best overall response, event-free survival, duration of response, disease-freesurvival,timetonew antileukemictherapy,and overall survival. Response was determined using the NCI/ International Workshop on CLL guideline (5). End of trial was defined as 8 years after the last patient was enrolled. Results Demographics Patientdemographicsanddiseasecharacteristics,includ- ing CLL prognostic factors were balanced at baseline between treatment arms (Table 1). ',\n"," 'The median age was 73 years, 76% of patients had multiple coexisting medical conditions and 68% had a CrCl <70 mL/min. Efficacy The IRC-assessed median PFS was 23.0 months in the GClb arm versus 11.1 months in the Clb arm [Fig. 1 (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11–0.24; P < 0.0001 stratified log-rank test)]. The investigator-assessed median PFS durations were 23.0 months in the GClb arm and 10.9 months in the Clb arm (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09–0.21; P < 0.0001 stratified log-rank test). The results of the secondary end- points were supportive of the primary endpoint; however, there was no multiplicity adjustment plan for testing the secondaryendpoints.Table2liststheresultsoftheprimary andkeysecondaryendpoints.Theoverallsurvival(OS)data were not mature at the analysis cutoff date. The median observationtimewas14.2months,andthemediannumber of treatment cycles was 6. Eighty-one percent and 67% of patientsintheGClbandClbarms,respectively,receivedall 6 treatment cycles. Safety Thesafetydatasetincluded240patientswhoreceivedone ormoredosesofobinutuzumabwithClband116patients who received Clb only. Although Clb dose modifications or delays occurred twice as often in the GClb arm (32% vs. 15%), the median cumulative dose was comparable in the twoarms (370mg vs.384 mg). The mostfrequently reported adverse reactions with an incidence of 5% or greater and occurring at least 2% more frequently in the GClb arm were infusion-related reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pyrexia, cough, leukopenia, and musculoskeletal pains (Table 3). The most common serious adverse reaction was infusion-related reaction (11%). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was more common in the GClb arm (34%) than in the Clb arm (16%). The incidence of infections was not higher in the GClb arm, but 32% of patients in the GClb arm received G-CSF compared with 14% in the Clb arm. Growth factors were allowed for neutropenia per investigator or institutional guidelines. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 4% of patients in the GClb arm. Theincidenceofinfusionreactionswas69%withthefirst infusion of obinutuzumab, and the incidence of reactions with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1,000 mg and <1% thereafter. Symptoms of infusion-related reactionsoccurringingreaterthan20%ofpatientsincluded hypotension, nausea, chills, and pyrexia. Changes to the administration of obinutuzumab during the trial (includ- ingglucocorticoid,analgesic,andantihistaminetreatment, omission of antihypertensive medications in the morning ofthefirstinfusion,andadministrationofthecycle1day1 dose over 2 days) seemed to reduce the incidence of infu- sion reactions. Late-occurring neutropenia ( 28 days after treatment) was seen in 16% of patients on the GClb arm and 12% of patients on the Clb arm.

The main adverse reactions that occurred in the GClb arm were infusion reactions and myelosuppression. Other important toxicities included in the labeling were the risks of hepatitis B virus reactivation and JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoence- phalopathy, which were observed in patients treated with obinutuzumab in other clinical trials.

The results of trial CLL11 indicate that the combination of obinutuzumab þ chlor- ambucil is more effective than chlorambucil alone, has an acceptable safetyprofile, andisanappropriate regimen for elderly patients with previously untreated CLL and comor- bidities. Because aggressive treatments for older patients with comorbidities are poorly tolerated, chlorambucil was considered an acceptable active control for this trial. How- ever, in future trials in this patient population the GClb regimen would be an appropriate control.

Abstract: 250  Body text: 4495  Figures/tables: 6  References: 30  Supplementary figures/tables: 7  Page 4 of 30  Translational relevance  Pinatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22 on B cells and containing  the potent antimicrotubule agent MMAE. In this Phase I study, clinical activity of pinatuzumab  vedotin was observed in heavily pretreated patients with advanced non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (NHL). In addition, evaluating the combination of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab administered at standard doses and schedules was feasible. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of antibody-drug conjugates to deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy to tumors and  further validates CD22 as a target suitable for an antibody-drug conjugate. The safety,  tolerability, and clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab has important implications  for the ability of antibody-drug conjugates to be combined with standard anti-cancer treatment  regimens in B-cell malignancies, and support further clinical investigation of these novel  therapeutic combinations. Page 5 of 30  Abstract  Purpose: Pinatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate with the potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to an anti-CD22 antibody via a protease- cleavable linker. ',\n"," 'This Phase I study determined its recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and  evaluated its safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity alone and with rituximab relapsed/refractory (r/r) non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Experimental Design: Patients received escalating doses of pinatuzumab vedotin every days. Clinical activity at the RP2D alone or with rituximab was evaluated in r/r diffuse large B- cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and r/r indolent NHL (iNHL) patients. Results: Seventy-five patients received single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin. The RP2D was 2.4  mg/kg, based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of Grade 4 neutropenia >7 days in 1/3 patients  and Grade 4 neutropenia <7 days in 2/3 patients treated at 3.2 mg/kg (maximum assessed dose). No DLTs occurred at 2.4 mg/kg. At the RP2D, neutropenia was the most common Grade  ≥3 adverse event. Peripheral neuropathy-related Grade ≥2 adverse events most frequently resulted in treatment discontinuation. Rituximab co-treatment did not impact safety, tolerability,  or pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin. Unconjugated MMAE exposure was much lower  than antibody-conjugated MMAE exposure without accumulation with repeat dosing. At the  RP2D, objective responses were observed in DLBCL (9/25) and iNHL (7/14) patients; 2/8  patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (RP2D) and rituximab had complete responses. CLL  patients showed no objective responses. Conclusions: The RP2D of pinatuzumab vedotin alone and with rituximab was 2.4 mg/kg, which  was well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity in r/r NHL. Page 6 of 30  Introduction  Despite improvements in outcomes of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), many patients experience disease recurrence progression. Such patients have incurable disease requiring repeated courses of treatment, with  survival ranging from less than 1 year for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1) to several  years for indolent NHL (iNHL) (2, 3). Treatments that significantly extend disease-free intervals  and overall survival with minimal treatment-associated toxicity continue to be an unmet need. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) directed against tumor-associated surface antigens provide targeted delivery of chemotherapy, with the goal of improving potency while reducing  systemic cytotoxic effects. CD22 is an accessory molecule that plays a role in B-cell antigen receptor signaling and is  expressed on mature B cells, more than 95% of B-cell NHL, as well as in CLL (4; Genentech,  data on file). The lineage specificity of CD22 makes it an attractive target for antibody-based  therapeutics. ',\n"," 'Epratuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD22, relies on antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for anti-tumor activity, similar to rituximab. It has been  tested clinically, has an acceptable safety profile and single-agent activity in patients with  DLBCL and iNHL (5, 6), and is combinable with standard anti-lymphoma treatment regimens (7). ADCs targeting CD22 internalize upon binding to the target, which is considered essential for ADC activity, and have demonstrated pre-clinical anti-tumor activity (8). Pinatuzumab vedotin  is an ADC consisting of the microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE),  conjugated to an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody via the protease-cleavable peptide linker  maleimidocaproylvaline-citrulline(vc)-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (9–11). MMAE has a mode of  action similar to vincristine, which is commonly used to treat NHL and is the cytotoxic component of the anti-CD30–targeting ADC, brentuximab vedotin, which is approved for the  treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (12). While the  Page 7 of 30  unconjugated antibody of pinatuzumab vedotin demonstrated modest activity against tumor  xenografts in mouse models of NHL suggestive of some level of ADCC and/or complement- dependent cytotoxicity, tumor regression was significantly more pronounced with treatment with  the ADC form (13). Together, these data supported the clinical feasibility of a CD22-directed  ADC for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The goals of this multicenter, open-label phase I study were to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and  preliminary anti-tumor activity of pinatuzumab vedotin in patients with NHL and CLL. Materials and Methods  Study Design and Patients  This Phase I multicenter, open-label study employed a 3+3 dose-escalation design determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Eight centers enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse DLBCL, iNHL (including follicular lymphoma, marginal zone  lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL, and for  whom no suitable therapy of curative intent or higher priority existed. Demonstration of tumor  CD22 expression was not required. ',\n"," 'Eligibility criteria included: age ≥18 years; Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2; measurable disease; adequate end-organ function as assessed by standard laboratory chemistries and hematology tests; no  prior antibody or ADC within 4 weeks; no radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or investigational treatment within two weeks prior to the first dose of pinatuzumab vedotin; no prior allogeneic  stem cell transplant; no autologous stem cell transplant within 100 days of first study treatment  administration; no history of central nervous system lymphoma; Grade ≤1 peripheral neuropathy. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards prior to patient recruitment and  was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Page 8 of 30  Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients signed an informed consent prior enrollment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01209130. Procedures  Pinatuzumab vedotin (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was administered  intravenously over 30–90 minutes in 21-day cycles, with the starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg based  on pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic data of pinatuzumab vedotin in cynomolgus monkeys (Genentech, Inc.; data on file). Patients were monitored during the first cycle for dose- limiting toxicities (DLT) defined as: Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding nausea or  vomiting in the absence of premedication or that could be medically managed; febrile neutropenia; Grade ≥3 neutropenia without recovery by at least one grade/week in the absence  of growth factor support (growth factor support was permitted beyond the first cycle); Grade ≥3  thrombocytopenia without recovery by at least one grade/week in the absence of bleeding, associated with bleeding, or requirement for platelet transfusion. The highest dose where <33%  of a minimum of six patients experienced a DLT was designated as the MTD. The RP2D was  determined on the totality of the data observed in the dose-escalation cohorts, including  pharmacokinetics, DLTs, safety, and tolerability. Decisions regarding dose escalation were not  made until all patients enrolled in the dose-escalation cohort, regardless of number, were  evaluated through the DLT observation period. In the absence of toxicities, intra-patient dose  escalation to the highest cleared dose level was permitted. Indication-specific expansion cohorts (r/r DLBCL and r/r iNHL) were enrolled to further assess the safety and tolerability and to preliminarily assess efficacy of pinatuzumab vedotin at  the RP2D. ',\n"," 'An additional cohort was enrolled to receive pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D  combined with rituximab (375 mg/m ) every 21 days. Study treatment (single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin or pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab) was continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician  decision. Following documented disease progression, patients were followed until resolution or  Page 9 of 30  stabilization of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Patients who discontinued study  treatment for reasons other than progression of disease were followed for response and survival  for up to one year. For patients with treatment-emergent Grade 3–4 non-neuropathic AEs and  Grade 2–3 peripheral sensory neuropathy AEs, treatment delays of up to two weeks were  permitted. Patients were permitted to resume treatment at the end of two weeks upon resolution  of the AE(s). In these cases, patient doses were reduced to a previously established dose level. Rituximab dose modifications were not permitted. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE 2014). Adverse events were coded preferred terms as defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Laboratory monitoring (hematology and serum chemistries) was conducted at least weekly for  the first four cycles, then on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle thereafter. Investigator-based assessments of anti-tumor activity using computed tomography (CT), CT-positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in accordance with standard  response criteria for NHL (14) or CLL (15), were conducted every three months, independently of treatment schedule. The pharmacokinetic profile of pinatuzumab vedotin was characterized by analysis of serum  total antibody (TAb; including conjugated and deconjugated antibody) and rituximab, measured by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Genentech, Inc.; data  on file); and plasma conjugate (antibody-conjugated MMAE [acMMAE]) and unconjugated MMAE as measured by validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (Genentech, Inc.; data on file). Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using non- compartmental analysis (WinNonlin, Version 5.2.1; Pharsight, Princeton, NJ). Anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) were measured in serum by validated ELISA (Genentech, Inc.; data on file)  and further characterized by competitive binding with unconjugated anti-CD22 antibody Page 10 of 30  determine if responses were primarily directed against the antibody or the linker-drug portion of  the ADC. ',\n"," 'Outcomes  The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pinatuzumab vedotin  administered every 21 days in patients with r/r NHL and CLL, determine the MTD and DLTs of  pinatuzumab vedotin, identify an RP2D for pinatuzumab vedotin, and assess the safety and  tolerability of pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab in patients with r/r NHL. Secondary  objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin, determine the  incidence of ATAs, and preliminarily evaluate anti-tumor activity per standard response criteria  (14, 15). Statistical Analysis  Sample-size determinations were not based on explicit power and type I error assumptions, but rather to obtain sufficient safety, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetic data to inform  subsequent clinical testing of pinatuzumab vedotin. Planned enrollment of 30–50 patients during  dose escalation was based upon the assumption that 5–8 cohorts containing 3–6 patients each  would be enrolled, with allowances for patient replacement. An objective response rate (ORR)  ≥30% with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin would be viewed as encouraging. For an ORR  ≥30%, the probability of observing ≥2 responses among 10 patients is ≥85% and the probability  of observing ≥4 responses among 20 patients is ≥89%. Together, the total planned sample size  for escalation and expansion was 80–100 patients. Patients who received any amount of pinatuzumab vedotin were evaluable for safety analyses. Patients with baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline tumor  assessment following pinatuzumab vedotin treatment were evaluable for efficacy analyses. Progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) were analyzed by the Kaplan- Meier method and were defined as the time from the first day of study treatment and response,  respectively, to disease progression or death. In the absence of progressive disease, death, or  Page 11 of 30  loss to follow-up, PFS and DOR were censored for survival analysis at the day of the last tumor  assessment. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results  Patient Enrollment, Treatment, and DLT Determination  Between October 26, 2010 and December 12, 2012, 91 patients were enrolled into the study  (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Table 1). Seventy-five patients were treated with  single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin and 16 patients were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. Patient baseline and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1. ',\n"," 'Thirty-two NHL patients were treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at dose levels  of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.2 mg/kg. One DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia with delayed  recovery was observed among 3 evaluable patients treated at the 3.2-mg/kg dose level. The  other two patients treated at the 3.2-mg/kg dose level experienced Grade 4 neutropenia with  recovery occurring in fewer than seven days. Based on these observations, while 3.2 mg/kg did  not exceed the protocol-defined MTD, no further dose escalation was tested. None of the six  patients treated in the 2.4 mg/kg dose escalation cohort experienced a DLT. Consequently, 2.4  mg/kg every 21 days was designated the RP2D in r/r NHL. Thirty-nine NHL patients were  treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, including 25 with DLBCL and 14  with iNHL (including one patient with transformed follicular lymphoma), with a median of 5  cycles (range 1–19) for DLBCL patients and a median of 5 cycles (range 1–27) for iNHL  patients. A total of 16 patients received pinatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab; five  patients received pinatuzumab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg and 11 received pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4  mg/kg. No DLTs were observed in any patient; two patients who were enrolled to receive pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg were not evaluable for DLT because of clinical disease  Page 12 of 30  progression during the DLT observation period. Patients receiving the combination received a  median of 5.5 cycles (range 1–24). Ten patients with CLL were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin at 1.0, 1.8, and 2.4 mg/kg. DLTs were observed. Because enrollment of CLL patients was terminated by the sponsor, the  MTD was not formally determined. Safety  Treatment-emergent AEs with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin by assigned dose level and  histology and Grade 3–5 treatment-emergent AEs with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin across all dose levels and histologies (NHL and CLL), regardless of attribution to the study drug  by the treating physician, are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Most AEs reported in the 39 NHL patients treated at the RP2D (2.4 mg/kg) were Grade 1–2  in severity (Figure 1). Twenty-seven (69%) patients reported Grade 3–4 adverse events; the  most common in ≥2 patients included neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral sensory neuropathy, hyperglycemia, and anemia. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia was reported in one patient. ',\n"," 'Serious  AEs were reported in 13 (33%) NHL patients. Pyrexia was reported in three patients and  dyspnea in two patients; otherwise, no single serious AE was reported in ≥2 patients. Thirteen  (33%) patients discontinued pinatuzumab vedotin treatment due to an AE. Peripheral neuropathy-related AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 11 patients (peripheral sensory  neuropathy in 7 patients, peripheral motor neuropathy in 2 patients, peripheral sensorimotor  neuropathy and undefined in one patient each); no other AE led to treatment discontinuation >1 patient. Sixteen (41%) patients had at least one dose delay due to an adverse event. Nine  patients had a dose reduction to 1.8 mg/kg: 6 for peripheral neuropathy and 1 each for  neutropenia, pancreatitis, and fatigue. Among the ten patients with CLL who were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin across all  assessed dose levels, three patients had a Grade 3 event, one patient had a Grade 4 event and  one patient had a Grade 5 event of progressive disease. No single Grade 3–5 event was  Page 13 of 30  reported in more than one patient. With the exception of the patient who discontinued due to  Grade 5 progressive disease, no dose reductions or treatment discontinuations for adverse  events were reported. Among the 16 patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (both 1.8 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg dose levels) combined with rituximab, the most common treatment-emergent AEs in ≥4 patients  were fatigue (n = 8), neutropenia (n = 6), diarrhea (n = 5), peripheral sensory neuropathy (n =  5), nausea (n = 4), and constipation (n = 4) (Supplementary Table 2). Ten patients experienced  a Grade 3–4 AE: neutropenia (n = 4), peripheral sensory neuropathy (n = 2) and hyperglycemia (n = 2). Four patients discontinued study treatment for an AE: peripheral sensory neuropathy (n  = 2); increased blood creatinine phosphokinase and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n = 1 each). Five patients had at least one dose delay for AEs and three had a dose reduction for AEs (n = 2  peripheral neuropathy and n = 1 neutropenia). A total of six deaths (DLBCL [n = 4], MCL [n = 1] and CLL [n = 1]) were reported 23–55 days  after the last dose of pinatuzumab vedotin. ',\n"," 'Four deaths were reported following single-agent  pinatuzumab vedotin (progressive disease, n = 3; failure to thrive, n = 1) and two following  pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab due to disease progression. None of the deaths  were attributed to pinatuzumab vedotin by the treating investigator. AEs associated with peripheral neuropathy, as defined by the MedDRA Standardized Query, were reported in 23 of 39 (59%) NHL patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, and in 7 of 16 patients (44%) treated in combination with rituximab, and  were Grade ≤2 in 19 of 23 (83%) and 12 of 16 (75%), respectively. The median time to onset of  the first peripheral neuropathy event was 2.8 months following a median of 2 cycles. The  median time to develop a Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 6.2 months of treatment or a  median of 7 cycles. Fifteen patients discontinued study treatment due to a peripheral neuropathy-related AE. No differences in time-to-onset were observed based on disease histology. The majority of study treatment discontinuations occurred with Grade 2 events at a  Page 14 of 30  median of 7.4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1–10.3 months). Among 33 peripheral neuropathy events that resulted in treatment delays, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuations, complete resolution of the peripheral neuropathy event was reported in 10  (30%). Prior history of peripheral neuropathy and/or prior treatment with vinca alkaloids, which  were reported in 29/91 (32%) and 72/91 (79%) of all treated patients, respectively, were not  associated with a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy resulting from pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment. The incidence of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during pinatuzumab vedotin treatment was generally similar to that among patients who lacked either or both of  these baseline factors (Supplementary Table 3). Pharmacokinetics  Pharmacokinetic parameters for acMMAE, TAb, and unconjugated MMAE in NHL patients are summarized in Table 2. Concentration-time pharmacokinetic profiles are illustrated Supplementary Figure 2. Maximal concentrations (Cmax) for acMMAE and TAb were observed the end of infusion. At the RP2D, mean half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL) values for acMMAE  and TAb were similar, with volumes of distribution for both largely approaching plasma volume. These parameters were not affected by rituximab co-administration. Unconjugated MMAE Cmax  was observed 2–4 days after pinatuzumab vedotin administration (Supplementary Figure 2). ',\n"," 'Unconjugated MMAE Cmax and exposure (AUCinf, area under the concentration-time curve from  time 0 extrapolated to infinity) were much lower than those of acMMAE. At 2.4 mg/kg, there was  approximately a 124–165-fold difference for Cmax and approximately a 42–70-fold difference for  AUCinf between acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE respectively. No unconjugated MMAE  accumulation was observed with repeat dosing. The pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL patients was notable for faster acMMAE and TAb clearance compared to that observed in NHL patients at each corresponding dose level (Supplementary Table 4). Page 15 of 30  For patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin, 1 of 72 ATA-evaluable patients  (1.4%) tested positive for ATAs. For patients treated in combination with rituximab, none of 15  evaluable patients tested positive for ATAs. Together, the overall treatment-emergent ATA  incidence was 1.1% (1 of 87). Characterization by competitive binding indicated that the  antibody response was directed primarily to the antibody portion of pinatuzumab vedotin  (Genentech, data on file). Anti-tumor activity  The median duration of follow-up of all efficacy-evaluable patients across all dose levels was  3.8 months (range 0.07–27.6+ months, IQR 1.4–7.6 months). Objective responses are summarized in Table 3. Tumor reductions were mostly observed at pinatuzumab vedotin doses  ≥1.8 mg/kg (Figure 2). Objective responses at the single-agent RP2D included 5 of 20 (25%)  patients with refractory DLBCL (2 complete responses, 3 partial responses [PR]); 1 PR was  observed among the 6 DLBCL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. Objective responses were observed in 5 of 12 (42%) patients with refractory iNHL  treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin (3 complete responses, 2 PRs) and 1 PR of 3  patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab. In DLBCL patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, the median  PFS was 4.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–5.5 months, IQR 2.1–17 months) (Figure  3A); the median DOR was 3.0 months (95% CI 1 month–not reached, IQR 2.8–13.1 months). iNHL patients (Figure 3B), the median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI 1.3–15.2 months, IQR 6.7– 15.2 months); the median DOR was 4.2 months (95% CI 1.2–20.7 months, IQR 2.8–6.9 months). ',\n"," 'The median PFS for patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab was 5.8  months (95% CI 1.2 months–not reached, IQR 1.3 months–not reached); the median DOR was  not reached (IQR 4.9 months–not reached). In MCL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin  at doses ≥1.8 mg/kg alone or combined with rituximab, the PFS ranged from 0.4–9.2 months. Page 16 of 30  No clear correlations between PFS outcomes and baseline characteristics were identified (Supplementary Table 5). None of the 10 CLL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin achieved an objective response (Table 3). Discussion  Results from this study established pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg every 21 days as the  RP2D in r/r NHL. Neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were the principal treatment-emergent toxicities. Neutropenia was expected based on pre-clinical toxicology observations (Genentech,  Inc.; data on file) and clinical experience with brentuximab vedotin and polatuzumab vedotin,  both of which contain the same linker-MMAE construct as pinatuzumab vedotin (12, 16). Neutropenia mostly manifested as laboratory abnormalities and, in most cases, did not lead to  study treatment discontinuation. Clinical sequelae of neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia  and severe infections, were uncommon. Administration of growth factors in accordance with  published guidelines (17) and increasing the cycle duration to 28 days facilitated neutrophil  count recovery and enabled continued treatment. Peripheral neuropathy is consistent with the mechanism of action of MMAE and is  considered to be an effect of this class of drugs. The frequency and severity of peripheral  neuropathy events observed with pinatuzumab vedotin were generally similar to that observed  in r/r HL patients treated with brentuximab vedotin (18), despite differences in dose (2.4 mg/kg  vs. 1.8 mg/kg), and were similar to that observed with polatuzumab vedotin in r/r NHL (16). Most  events were sensory; however, peripheral motor neuropathy and combined peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy were also observed. Patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy  underwent dose delays until resolution before resuming treatment at a reduced dose, but the full  impact of these measures on peripheral neuropathy reversibility requires further study. While  the majority of patients who were enrolled into the study received prior treatment with neurotoxic  Page 17 of 30  therapies, neither this nor a prior history of peripheral neuropathy was associated with a  substantially increased risk of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy. ',\n"," 'Identifying additional  factors (e.g., age, pre-existing neuropathic conditions, or other co-morbidities that result in a  higher predisposition to peripheral neuropathy with vc-MMAE–based ADCs) and assessing the  relationship between peripheral neuropathy and pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics requires additional study. The pharmacokinetic properties of pinatuzumab vedotin are largely consistent with reports  of other MMAE ADCs (12, 16). The levels of unconjugated MMAE were consistently much lower  than those of the conjugate (acMMAE). The overall pharmacokinetic profile of pinatuzumab vedotin appeared largely driven by the antibody component, given the similarities between total  antibody and conjugate (acMMAE) pharmacokinetics. Response rates, PFS, and DOR with pinatuzumab vedotin treatment in NHL were  encouraging given the heavily pretreated patient population with advanced disease. Anti-tumor  responses were observed at doses ≥1.8 mg/kg, suggesting that patients who require dose  reductions from the RP2D for treatment-emergent toxicity may also receive continued clinical  benefit with longer treatment durations. Interestingly, in five patients, pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment resulted in responses sufficient to enable subsequent allogeneic stem cell  transplantation (data not shown). Additional studies will be required to assess the potential of  pinatuzumab vedotin as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation in previously transplant-ineligible patients. Unlike NHL, there was no early evidence of clinical benefit of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL  patients. Recognizing that treatment-emergent toxicities may differ between NHL and CLL due  to underlying differences in clinical characteristics and natural history, separate pinatuzumab  vedotin dose escalations were conducted for each. Given the decision to terminate enrollment  of CLL patients into the study, the MTD of pinatuzumab vedotin was not determined, and direct  comparison of treatment-emergent safety data between NHL and CLL patients is therefore not  Page 18 of 30  possible. In CLL patients who were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin, no objective responses  were observed. Pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics indicated lower exposure and faster  clearance for TAb and acMMAE in CLL compared to NHL patients, presumably due to the  greater number of circulating B cells in CLL patients, resulting in significant target-mediated  clearance of pinatuzumab vedotin. This profile is similar to what was observed with polatuzumab vedotin treatment in CLL patients (16). Whether this and other factors may have  ultimately affected the anti-tumor activity of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL requires further study. ',\n"," 'Overall, the clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin treatment supports the therapeutic potential of ADCs targeting CD22 in patients with B-cell NHL. The risk-benefit profile pinatuzumab vedotin appears distinct from its individual components. For example, the  response rates of 2.4 mg/kg pinatuzumab vedotin in r/r DLBCL (9 of 25 [36%]) and r/r iNHL (7 of  14 [50%]) compare favorably to those of the monoclonal anti-CD22 antibody epratuzumab, which has single-agent objective response rates of 15% in DLBCL (6) and 18% in iNHL (5). addition, the tolerability profile of epratuzumab is similar to that of other unconjugated monoclonal antibodies, without the toxicities (neutropenia or peripheral neuropathy) observed  with pinatuzumab vedotin treatment. Pinatuzumab vedotin also compares favorably vincristine and liposomal vincristine, the latter of which had an objective response rate of 25% in  aggressive NHL and was associated with considerably worse neurotoxicity (29% Grade 3, 3%  Grade 4 vs. 17% Grade 3, no Grade 4 events for pinatuzumab vedotin observed in this study)  (19). Finally, the clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin compares favorably with other ADCs  targeting B-cell antigens (20); the response rate of pinatuzumab vedotin in r/r DLBCL is  comparable with those observed with the CD22-targeted calicheamicin ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin (15%), the CD79b-targeted polatuzumab vedotin (52%), the CD19-targeted maytansinoid ADC SAR3419 (33%), and brentuximab vedotin in CD30+ DLBCL (44%) (16, 21– 23). While anti-tumor activity is generally similar, it is important to note that each ADC has a  distinct toxicity profile based largely on the mechanism of action of the cytotoxic agent:  Page 19 of 30  neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy for pinatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and  brentuximab vedotin, thrombocytopenia for inotuzumab ozogamicin, and ocular toxicities for  SAR3419. Consequently, maximizing the risk-benefit profile of ADCs (e.g., through alternate  doses and schedules to minimize the frequency and severity of peripheral neuropathy) is an  important issue that requires further investigation. To realize the full therapeutic potential of ADCs, it is crucial to demonstrate the ability of  ADCs to combine with or replace agents that constitute current standards of care. In this regard,  demonstrating the combinability of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab is important given the  effectiveness of rituximab-containing regimens in NHL (24, 25). ',\n"," 'Clinical data with other  rituximab-ADC combinations have demonstrated additive clinical activity over either agent  alone; the addition of rituximab to inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in higher objective response  and complete response rates over inotuzumab ozogamicin alone (21, 26). Furthermore, the  ability of combining CD22- and CD20-directed antibodies was demonstrated in a Phase II study  of epratuzumab and rituximab in previously untreated follicular lymphoma, with evidence clinical activity comparable to standard chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy based regimens  (27). Preliminary results in this study suggest that the toxicity profiles between combined  pinatuzumab vedotin and rituximab and single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin are similar. Pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics was unaffected by rituximab co-administration and vice  versa (data not shown). While durable responses with the combination were observed, the  individual contributions of each agent to overall anti-tumor activity could not be determined due  to the small number of patients treated. Further assessment of the pinatuzumab  vedotin/rituximab combination is ongoing in a Phase II randomized study (ROMULUS, NCT01691898) comparing the clinical activity of two MMAE ADCs, pinatuzumab vedotin and  polatuzumab vedotin, each in combination with rituximab. Preliminary results indicate unexpected safety findings and greater clinical activity compared to either ADC alone (28). patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, for example, objective and complete response (CR)  Page 20 of 30  rates of pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab were greater than those of the single- agent pinatuzumab vedotin (ORR, 57% vs. 36%; CR, 24% vs. 16%, for combination vs. single- agent, respectively). Beyond combinations with rituximab early data from ongoing clinical  studies indicate the ability of ADCs, including polatuzumab vedotin and brentuximab vedotin, to  combine with systemic chemotherapy used in current anti-lymphoma immunochemotherapy regimens (29, 30). In summary, results of this Phase I study of pinatuzumab vedotin demonstrate clinical activity of CD22-directed ADCs that warrants further clinical investigation of this class of  molecules in B-cell malignancies. Given the emerging biologic heterogeneity and complexity of  B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, correlative analyses to identify predictive and prognostic  biomarkers will be important to identify patients most likely to benefit from pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment. ',\n"," 'Finally, results from this study further substantiate CD22 as a clinically validated ADC  target and opens up the possibility of developing ADCs targeting CD22 that contain different  classes of cytotoxic agents, ultimately leading to ADC combinations that target multiple B-cell  lineage antigens to deliver multiple cytotoxic agents more effectively than systemic multi-agent  chemotherapy.

Extended analysis of RESONATE-2 was conducted to determine long-term efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A total of 269 patients aged ≥65 years with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia with- out del(17p) were randomized 1:1 to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. Median ibru- tinib treatment duration was 28.5 months. Ibrutinib significantly pro- longed progression-free survival versus chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 15 months; hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001). The 24-month progression-free survival was 89% with ibrutinib (97% and 89% in patients with del[11q] and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, respec- tively). Progression-free survival rates at 24 months were also similar regardless of age (<75 years [88%], ≥75 years [89%]). Overall response rate was 92% (125/136). Rate of complete response increased substan- tially from 7% at 12 months to 18% with extended follow up. Greater quality of life improvements occurred with ibrutinib versuschlorambu- cil in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (P=0.0013). The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were neutrope- nia (12%), anemia (7%), and hypertension (5%). Rate of discontinua- tions due to adverse events was 12%. Results demonstrated that first- line ibrutinib for elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia provides sustained response and progression-free survival benefits over chemotherapy, with depth of response improving over time without new toxicity concerns.

With a median age at diagnosis of 71 years, management of this predominately older population is controversial given that frequent comorbidi- ties often preclude aggressive therapy. Randomized stud- ies have provided disparate results in older compared with younger patients. 2,3 Less intensive approaches, such as chlorambucil, provide limited response durability. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies has improved out- comes achieved with single-agent chlorambucil, adminis- tration of these intravenous agents has associated toxicity, and response durations remain limited. The first-in-class, oral, once-daily, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib targets signaling via the  B-cell receptor cascade, critical to survival of malignant lymphocytes. ',\n"," 'in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Early-phase studies demonstrat- ed responses of up to 84% in previously untreated patients, with complete response (CR) rates of up to 23% and up to 3 years of median follow up. 11,12 This small cohort suggested that single-agent ibrutinib might provide durable efficacy in first-line treatment of patients with CLL while avoiding toxicity inherent to cytotoxic or other infused regimens. RESONATE-2 was an international phase 3 study designed to definitively evaluate first-line ibrutinib treat- ment in older patients who often had baseline frailties against a standard chemotherapeutic agent, chlorambu- cil. Primary results demonstrated an 84% reduction in the risk of death at a median follow up of 18 months for ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil. Based on these findings, ibrutinib received approval in the United States, Europe, and other regions for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL, and allows for treatment without chemotherapy. 14,15  A detailed analysis of overall survival (OS) with longer follow up and adjustment for the impact of treatment crossover was previously reported. A sepa- rate data cut was subsequently performed after this detailed OS analysis to evaluate additional outcomes after long-term follow up. Herein, we present the extended analysis of additional outcomes from RESONATE-2 including quality-of-life (QOL) measures that may help guide appropriate use of ibrutinib for previously untreated patients. Methods Study design and population Eligible patients for RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115/1116; clinicaltri- als.gov identifier 01722487/01724346) had previously untreated CLL or SLL with active disease and were ≥65 years. Patients ≤70 years of age must have had a comorbidity that precluded treatment with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 cells/mm , platelet count ≥50,000/mm , and adequate liver and kidney function. Those with del(17p) CLL were excluded. This study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and approved by the institutional review boards of participating insti- tutions. All patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with oral ibrutinib, 420 mg once daily until disease progression or chlo- rambucil, 0.5 mg/kg (increased up to 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerabil- ity) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. ',\n"," 'Patients from the chlorambucil treatment arm with independent review com- mittee (IRC)-confirmed disease progression were eligible to cross over to second-line treatment with ibrutinib at the investigator’s discretion. End points and assessments End points included progression-free survival (PFS, defined as time from randomization to progression or death, whichever occurs earlier), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), improvement in hematologic variables, patient-reported health- related QOL, and safety. Disease progression and response was determined by investigator. QOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)- Fatigue questionnaires. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameters. Non-hematologic AEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03. Hematologic AEs were graded using International Workshop on CLL criteria. Statistical analyses PFS and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and a 2-sided log-rank test stratified by the randomization factors. Sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust for the impact of crossover on OS as previously described. ORR was analyzed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel c test, stratified by the ran- domization factors. QOL analyses were based on the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful changes in scores from base- line (≥3 points for FACIT-Fatigue). Additional QOL analyses used time-dependent mixed-models repeated measures analysis. Results Patients There were 269 patients randomly assigned to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) monotherapy in the RES- ONATE-2 study (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Patient characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms, as previously reported (Table 1). The median patient age was 73 years on the ibrutinib arm and 72 years on the chlorambucil arm. In the ibrutinib treatment arm, of those evaluated, 22% (29/130) had del(11q), and 48% (58/121) had unmutated IGHV. Patients initiated ibrutinib treat- ment for active disease per iwCLL criteria, most common- ly manifesting as marrow failure (progressive anemia or thrombocytopenia [40%]), progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy (40%) or splenomegaly (26%), with many patients having more than one indication for treat- ment including disease symptoms such as fatigue or night sweats (Table 1). Although 32% of patients had substan- tial fatigue when entering study, only 5% were started on CLL treatment solely for fatigue that was considered to have interfered with work or usual activities. With a medi- an follow up for this extended analysis of 29 months (maximum, 36 months), 107 patients (79%) remain on first-line ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Extended Phase 3 Results From RESONATE-2 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) 1503 Survival outcomes Ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer PFS compared with chlorambucil (median, PFS not reached vs. 15.0 months; Figure 1A). There was an 88% reduction in risk of PFS events (progression or death; hazard ratio [HR], 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001) for patients random- ized to ibrutinib. PFS at 24 months was 89% with ibruti- nib versus34% with chlorambucil. This rate was relatively stable with ibrutinib with an 18-month PFS of 94%. Ibrutinib consistently demonstrated significant improve- ments in PFS for patients in all subgroups including those considered high risk (Figure 2). In patients treated with ibrutinib, only 1 patient with del(11q) has had disease pro- gression, and the rates of 24-month PFS were 97% and 86% for those with or without del(11q), respectively (Figure 1B). No significant difference was observed in the PFS of patients with unmutated versusmutated IGHV (24- month PFS, 90% and 89%, respectively; Figure 1C). PFS benefits were consistent across additional subgroups of patients, including those with advanced disease (Rai stage 3 or 4) or bulky disease (Figure 2). PFS and OS rates were also similar regardless of age (24-month PFS, <75 years [88%], ≥75 years [89%]; OS, <75 years [94%], ≥75 years [96%]; Figure S2). With longer follow up and despite patient crossover, ibrutinib continues to demonstrate an OS benefit compared with chlorambucil (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.86; P=0.0145; Online Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S1), with a 24-month OS of 95% for ibrutinib vs. 84% for chlorambucil (Online Supplementary Figure S3). Responses for ibrutinib-treated patients With a maximum of 36 months of follow up, the ORR with ibrutinib treatment was 92% (Table 2). Eighteen per- cent of patients achieved CR, which improved from 7% at 12 months and 15% at 24 months (Figure 3). Comparable ORR and CR rates were also observed in high-risk sub- groups, including those with del(11q) (ORR, 100%; CR rate, 14%) or unmutated IGHV (ORR, 95%; CR rate, 21%). Disease burden and symptoms The vast majority of ibrutinib-treated patients experi- enced substantial reduction in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly at the time of the primary analysis which was much greater than observed with chlorambucil. ',\n"," '≥50% reduction in the lymph node sum of the product of longest diameter (SPD) occurred in 95% of patients treat- ed with ibrutinib versus40% of those treated with chlo- rambucil, with complete resolution in lymphadenopathy in 42% versus 7%, respectively (Online Supplementary Figure S4A,B). Reduction in splenomegaly by ≥50% occurred in 95% with ibrutinib versus52% with chloram- bucil, with complete resolution in splenomegaly in 56% versus 22%, respectively (Online Supplementary Figure S4C,D). Ibrutinib also resulted in higher rates of improve- ments in disease symptoms including weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, which were indications for therapy in many patients. Patient-reported QOL Greater improvements in QOL occurred with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in FACIT-Fatigue (P=0.0013) by repeated measure analyses (Online Supplementary Figure S5). Clinically meaningful improvements occurred more frequently with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in FACIT- Fatigue, although this was not statistically significant (86/136 [63%] vs.71/133 [53%]; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.92-2.45; P=0.1013). Safety and tolerability of ibrutinib Median treatment duration with ibrutinib was 28.5 months (range, 0.7-35.9 months). Most patients continue ibrutinib treatment, with 83% (112/135) receiving ibruti- nib continuously for durations exceeding 2 years. The most frequent AEs with ibrutinib with extended follow up were similar to the primary report : diarrhea, fatigue, P.M. Barr et al. 1504 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) Table 1.

Several AEs of clinical interest were characterized in greater detail (Table 3). Diarrhea generally occurred early in treatment (median, 26 days) and was completely reversible in 95% of patients within a median of 6 days. ',\n"," 'Visual disturbances (blurred vision or reduced visual acu- ity) were grade 1 or 2, with 57% of these completely resolving within a median of 37.5 days after onset. Hypertension occurred at a median of 187 days, with improvements reported at a median of 14 days after onset. Arthralgia was observed at a median of 135 days and was generally reversible (78% complete, 4% partial) within a median duration of approximately 3 weeks. Atrial fibrilla- tion was observed throughout treatment follow up, with 4% of patients experiencing a grade 3 event. Symptoms of atrial fibrillation quickly resolved in the majority of patients (57% complete, 7% partial resolution) within a median of 3 days. Nine patients (7%) experienced a major hemorrhage occurring at a median of 310 days. Of these, 3 patients were reported to have active treatment with concomitant medications that impact platelets or coagula- tion (aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, and naprox- en, respectively) including a traumatic hematoma, post- procedural hematoma, and hematuria, all of which were grade 3 in severity and did not result in study drug discon- tinuation. Grade ≥3 infection occurred in 23% of patients at a median of 138 days, including 2 that were fatal (Klebsiellainfection and septic shock). Grade ≥3 infections were observed most frequently in the first year of treat- ment and decreased thereafter (Figure 4).

Serious AEs over the 3 years of follow up occurring in more than 2 ibrutinib-treated patients included pneumo- nia (11; 8%), atrial fibrillation (6; 4%), urinary tract infec- tion (5; 4%), basal cell carcinoma (5; 4%), hyponatremia (5; 4%), pleural effusion (4; 3%), hypertension (3; 2%), and anemia (3; 2%). Eighteen patients (13%) required dose reductions and 16 patients (12%) discontinued first-line ibrutinib because of AEs. AEs leading to discontinuation in more than  1 patient included infection (n=5), hemorrhage (n=3), atri- al fibrillation (n=2), and rash (n=2). ',\n"," 'Treatment-limiting toxicity including both reductions and discontinuations due to AEs decreased over time with ibrutinib (Figure 4). Concomitant medications Concomitant medications were collected throughout the duration of ibrutinib treatment (median, 28.5 months) and chlorambucil (median, 7.1 months). Despite longer follow up recording of the use of these agents in the ibru- tinib arm versus the chlorambucil arm, the rate of neu- trophil growth factor use and platelet and red blood cell transfusion was higher in the chlorambucil arm. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered to 4% of ibrutinib-treated patients versus2% of those randomized to chlorambucil. Anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents were frequently used during study therapy (56% and 54% of patients treated with ibrutinib and chlorambucil, respectively; Online Supplementary Table S3), including anticoagulants in 21% of the ibrutinib-treated patients. Outcomes following ibrutinib discontinuation With up to 3 years follow up, out of 136 patients, only 4 patients discontinued ibrutinib primarily due to disease progression; 1 had unmutated IGHV and none were reported to have del(11q). Two of these 4 patients remain alive. Of the 16 patients who discontinued ibrutinib because of AEs; 13 (81%) are alive with a median of 13 P.M. Barr et al. 1506 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) Figure 2.

Sex months follow up after ibrutinib discontinuation and 3 have died (Online Supplementary Table S4). Ten of the patients had PR as best response, 4 patients discontinued after not responding to ibrutinib and 2 patients discontin- ued prior to response evaluation. Non-responders/non- evaluable had a PFS that ranged from 1.8 to 20.2 months, while responders tended to have a variable but longer PFS (4.2–34.0 months). ',\n"," 'As the vast majority of patients (79%) remain on single-agent ibrutinib, this analysis is limited in size and also to the patients who came off treatment fairly early (9 of the 16 patients who discontinued due to AEs did so in the first year). In total, 7 patients received subse- quent therapy after ibrutinib at a median of 7.6 months following ibrutinib discontinuation (range, 1.2 to  20.8 months), including fludarabine-cyclophosphamide- rituximab (n=3), bendamustine-rituximab (n=2), chloram- bucil (n=1), and radiation (n=1). Six of these 7 patients (86%) remain alive with median follow up of 21 months (range, 9 to 25 months). Discussion This extended analysis of RESONATE-2 with detailed clinical follow up demonstrates that ibrutinib continues to provide significant and sustained clinical benefits, improv- ing the quality of responses, for the first-line treatment of older patients with CLL or SLL with a manageable safety profile over extended durations of treatment. Consistent with the initial report, ibrutinib demonstrates a significant 88% reduction in the risk of PFS events (progression or death) compared with chlorambucil (P<0.0001) with extended follow up. In addition, the OS benefit for ibruti- nib compared with chlorambucil was maintained, despite crossover to treatment with ibrutinib for many patients in the chlorambucil arm (n=55). These data support the use of ibrutinib in the first-line treatment of CLL as a chemotherapy-free option that can be taken continuously, achieving long-term disease control for the majority of patients including those with high risk features. 10,13 Ibrutinib has a category 1 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN ) recommendation as a single- agent first-line treatment for CLL without del(17p) in patients ≥65 years and for relapsed/refractory CLL with- out del(17p). The efficacy of ibrutinib in the first-line setting appears superior to that observed in relapsed or refractory patients. Nearly all patients randomly assigned to ibruti- nib achieved rapid disease reduction, with an ORR of 92% translating to high rates of 24-month PFS and OS of 89% and 95%, respectively, with similar PFS and OS rates seen regardless of age. This observation suggests that ibru- tinib may be most effective when used upfront before the acquisition of poor-risk molecular aberrations, which are selected for with chemotherapy. 20,21 Additionally, sensitiv- ity analyses to adjust for the effects of patients in RES- ONATE-2 who crossed over to ibrutinib found that treat- ment with ibrutinib was still associated with statically sig- nificant OS compared with chlorambucil. ',\n"," 'These results also demonstrate that depth of response substantially increases over time, with higher rates of CR during the extended follow up, indicating a persistent action of the drug rather than a simple maintenance effect. Similar find- ings were observed with long-term follow up of patients enrolled in the phase 2 trial of first-line ibrutinib. Within this previous study, 29% of patients achieved a CR, and 92% remained alive and progression free at 5 years. Given these data, the CR rate will likely continue to increase in the present study as long-term disease control and high tolerability with first-line use can be expected based on the earlier phase 2 results. In addition to the efficacy benefits overall, sustained Extended Phase 3 Results From RESONATE-2 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) 1507 Figure 3. Response rates over time in ibrutinib-treated patients.

No difference in outcome was observed in patients with unmutated IGHVstatus, a traditional poor prognostic indicator for all chemoimmunotherapy regi- mens. Notably the rate of unmutated IGHVin this study of older patients was somewhat lower than other studies at 48% (vs. 58%-62% in CLL ), consistent with prior reports of higher frequency of unmutated IGHV in younger patients. 4,23 For patients with del(11q), another traditionally high-risk subgroup, 100% of the 29 patients responded to treatment with ibrutinib, and there was a 99% reduction in the risk of progression or death, with only 1 del(11q) ibrutinib-treated patient experiencing dis- ease progression after discontinuing therapy for an AE over the extended follow up. While this represents a rela- tively small patient subset (22%), ibrutinib demonstrates a particularly significant benefit in this population, which historically experiences inferior outcomes with traditional chemotherapy or CD20-based regimens. 24-26  Combined analysis of 3 randomized studies not only demonstrated superiority of ibrutinib over traditional chemotherapy and/or anti-CD20 comparators for patients with del(11q), but also equally positive PFS and OS outcomes irrespec- tive of del(11q). These results suggest that current defini- tions of high-risk disease and the impact of prognostic bio- markers may need to be redefined with ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'The mechanism why del(11q) patients may have better out- comes when treated with ibrutinib is of high interest and is the subject of ongoing research. Safety of therapy administered to older patients over the long term is an area that requires close scrutiny. First- line ibrutinib appears to be well tolerated with extended treatment as evidenced by over 80% of this older popula- tion being able to continue treatment for more than 2 P.M.

',\n"," 'This extended follow up allowed for new observa- tions into the timing of when AEs occurred and time to resolution of AEs as well as the use of transfusions and growth factors. Diarrhea, while frequent, often occurred early during the first several months of treatment and was generally low grade and short-lived. Severe and treatment- limiting AE rates decreased over time with extended ibru- tinib treatment. A decrease in myelotoxicity and infec- tious complications over time was also observed. This contrasts with chemoimmunotherapy-associated AEs and was importantly associated with less medical resource uti- lization of neutrophil growth factors and slightly less transfusion need despite 4 times the treatment time with ibrutinib. While the rate of atrial fibrillation increased from 6% in the primary analysis to 10%, overall, ibruti- nib dose reduction or discontinuation due to atrial fibrilla- tion was uncommon and lessened with extended treat- ment in this population of older patients with CLL. Atrial fibrillation therefore appears manageable and does not fre- quently necessitate ibrutinib discontinuation. Additional information on the management and outcomes of atrial fibrillation along with associated anticoagulant therapy has been provided in a large pooled analysis of ibrutinib studies. Rates of major hemorrhage remained low despite half the patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. Previous work demonstrated that QOL is significantly compromised in patients with CLL, affecting physical fit- ness, cognitive function, levels of fatigue, and sleep. Worse scores were reported for patients receiving chemotherapy such as chlorambucil. Even with the addition of contem- porary anti-CD20 agents (obinutuzumab), no significant benefit in QOL has been noted. However, this extended follow up provides the first analysis of QOL, as measured by FACIT Fatigue Scale, following ibrutinib treatment in previously untreated patients. Significantly greater improvements in QOL were observed with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In line with this and the favorable impact on QOL and tolerable safety profile, 79% of patients remained on first-line treatment with ibrutinib at the time of this later analysis with up to 3 years of therapy. Patients who discontinue treatment for CLL including ibrutinib may have varied outcomes dependent on the reason for discontinuation. In 1 study that included most- ly patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, median OS following ibrutinib therapy was 33 months for those who discontinued because of AEs versus 16 months for those who discontinued because of disease progression. ',\n"," 'In our study, the 22 patients who discontinued therapy had a median follow up of 13 months after discontinuation. these 22 patients, 16 are still alive, while 2 of the 4 patients who progressed have died. Seven patients have received subsequent treatment, mostly chemoimmunotherapy (BR, FCR); 6 of those patients are still alive, with a median of 21 months of follow up. While retrospective analyses of real-world data have previously suggested that treatment with an alternate kinase inhibitor is more effective than chemoimmunotherapy following discontinuation of ibru- tinib, 31,32 our data suggests that patients who discontinue ibrutinib can respond to chemoimmunotherapy as sec- ond-line therapy. Continued follow up of patients in the RESONATE-2 trial who have discontinued ibrutinib will provide the needed further data as relatively few patients have progressed or stopped therapy to date. These data confirm that first-line treatment with ibruti- nib results in long-term PFS in patients with CLL and that response quality continues to improve with ibrutinib over time, with substantial increase in patients achieving CR. In addition, rates of grade ≥3 AEs during treatment with ibrutinib decreased over time. The most common reasons for initiating first-line treatment in these patients, includ- ing marrow failure, disease burden, and disease symp- toms, all improved to greater extents in patients treated with ibrutinib versuschemotherapy. Ongoing randomized studies, including ILLUMINATE (clinicaltrials.gov identifier 02264574), comparing ibrutinib-obinutuzumab with chlo- rambucil-obinutuzumab, and A041202 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier 01886872), comparing ibrutinib, ibrutinib-ritux- imab, and rituximab-bendamustine, will continue to define the role of ibrutinib for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL/SLL.

Indolent NHL (iNHL) constitutes approximately one third of NHLs, with follicular lym- phoma (FL), the most common type, accounting for 20% to 30%. Other indolent subtypes include small lymphocyticlymphoma(SLL)andmarginalzoneB-cell lymphoma (MZL, which includes nodal and splenic marginal zone), which account for approximately 7% and4%ofallNHLs,respectively. Thediseasecourse for iNHL is variable, with some patients remaining asymptomatic for extended periods and others re- quiring immediate intervention. ',\n"," 'For more than a decade, combinations of the anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab with alkylator or purine analog-based chemotherapy regimens (ie, chemoimmunotherapy) have been the cornerstone of frontline and relapsed iNHL therapy. 4-8 With such treatment,medianprogression-freesurvival(PFS)and overall survival (OS) for FL are 6 to 8 and 12 to 15 years, respectively. However, the approximately 20% of patients with FL treated with frontline rituximab pluscyclophosphamide,doxorubicin,andprednisone (R-CHOP) who progress within 2 years of initial di- agnosis also have a lower 5-year OS rate (50%) than patients without early progression (90%).

Despiterecentdrugapprovals,alternativetargeted therapies remain the focus of clinical trials that address diseaseresistance,whichreducesoptionsforpatientswith multiple treatment failures. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase whose catalytic subunit has four isoforms: a, b, g, and d. The a- and b-isoforms are widely expressed in many tis- sues; PI3K-g and PI3K-d are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells 12,13 and play predominantly non- overlapping roles in (MZL, which includes nodal and splenic), B-cell survival. Pathways mediated by PI3K-d and PI3K-g are involved in cell growth, migration, dif- ferentiation, and metabolism, all critical to the patho- genesisandprogressionofB-cellmalignancies. 14,15 PI3K- d inhibition targets malignant B-cell proliferation and survival through blockade of tumor cell autonomous and tumor microenvironment (TME)–mediated cytokine re- ceptor signaling, whereas PI3K-g inhibition disrupts the formationoftheTMEby inhibitingT-cellandmacrophage migration and macrophage polarization to a tumor- supporting M2 phenotype. 16-20 The TME is also impor- tant in the development and maintenance of hematologic malignancies, including iNHL. Thus, the cooperation of PI3K-g and PI3K-d in the interplay between tumor cells and the TME, and in the establishment/maintenance of the TME, makes dual inhibition an attractive therapeutic target. Duvelisib, an oral dual inhibitor of PI3K-d and -g, was approvedbytheUSFoodandDrugAdministration(FDA) inSeptember2018fortreatmentofrelapsedorrefractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or SLL after two or more prior therapies and for RR FL after two or morepriorsystemictherapies. ',\n"," 'prior therapies and for RR FL after two or morepriorsystemictherapies. Approvalof25mgtwice daily was supported by phase I findings that plasma exposure at higher doses did not further increase either response rates or markers of PI3K-d inhibition; 25 mg twice daily demonstrated clinical activity and an ac- ceptable safety profile in advanced hematologic malig- nancies in IPI-145-02 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01476657). Inthatstudy,theoverallresponserate (ORR) among 31 patients with RR iNHL treated with duvelisib monotherapy was 58.1%, including six (19.4%) complete responses (CRs). 23,24 Duvelisib’s dual mechanism of PI3K-d,-g inhibition may represent both a therapeutic advantage over selective PI3K-dinhibitors andanew alternativefor treatingB-cell malignancies. With consideration of the need for effec- tive new therapies for chemoimmunotherapy-refractory iNHL, the therapeutic value of duvelisib monotherapy in this high-risk population became the focus of the Duvelisib in Subjects With Refractory Indolent Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma (DYNAMO) study and duvelisib’s FDA approval. PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Design and Treatment DYNAMO was a single-arm, phase II, open-label study of the antitumor activity and safety of oral duvelisib mono- therapy in patients with relapsed iNHL refractory to ritux- imab (ie, no response or disease progression [PD] within 6 months after completion of therapy) and to either che- motherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT). The study was conducted at 56 sites across 12 countries in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Institutional review boards and/or ethics committees approved protocols at all sites. Study conduct followed International Conference on Har- monisationGuidelinesforGoodClinicalPractice,including writteninformedconsentfromallpatientsandrigorousdata monitoring. Oral duvelisib 25 mg twice daily was self-administered continuously in 28-day cycles until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Up to two dose reductions for the same treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were permitted. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpes zoster virus (HZV) was required. The primary end point was ORR assessed by an in- dependentreview committee (IRC) and defined asa CR or partial response (PR) per revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy end points in- cluded duration of response (DOR), PFS, OS, and time to response (TTR). Patient Eligibility Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmedFL,SLL,orMZL(splenic,nodal,andextranodal) andradiologicallymeasurablediseasewithalymphnodeor tumor mass greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in at least one dimension.Patientswithgrade3BFLorclinicalevidenceof transformation to an aggressive lymphoma subtype were excluded.

Response was based on revised IWG response criteria for NHL using consistent imaging: computed to- mography, positron emission tomography/computed to- mography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Safety assessments included physical examinations, elec- trocardiograms, and adverse event (AE) and clinical lab- oratory monitoring. Severity of TEAEs and laboratory abnormalities was graded using the National Cancer In- stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). An independent data monitoring com- mittee reviewed all safety information. After treatment discontinuation,survivaldatawerecollectedevery6months for up to 3 years from treatment initiation. Statistical Methods Using a group sequential design with one interim analysis, 120 patients provided more than 90% power to test the hypothesisofanORRgreaterthanorequalto45%against the null hypothesis of an ORR less than or equal to 30% at a one-sided overall significance level of .025. A P value and a two-sided 95% exact CI for ORR were calculated using the binomial distribution. Best tumor response (CR, PR, stable disease, or PD) was assessed for each patient. PFS was the time from first duvelisib dose to first documentation of PD or any-cause death. DOR was the time from first documentation of best response (CR or PR) to first documentation of PD or any- cause death. OS was the time from first dose to date of death, and TTR was the time from first dose to first doc- umentation of response. The lymph node response rate (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the sum of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions of the target lesion) also was calculated, and time-to-event end points were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

The final analysis was per- formed after the last enrolled patient completed 6 months oftherapy orexperiencedPD; thesedata, with2additional years of follow-up, are presented here, with an analysis cutoff date of May 2018. RESULTS Patient Characteristics From June 2013 to October 2015, 129 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of duvelisib. His- tologic subtypes included FL (83 patients), SLL (28 pa- tients), and MZL (18 patients). Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most patients (68.2%) were male, 89.9% were white, and themedianagewas65years(range,30to90years).Most patients (85%) had advanced-stage (III or IV) iNHL, and 67% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 (94.6%) or 2 (5.4%) at enrollment. Among patientswithFL,87%wereintermediateorhighriskperthe Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. Patients had received a median of three (range, one to 18) priorsystemicanticancerregimens,and52patients(40%) received four or more prior regimens. Nearly two thirds of patients had prior bendamustine (82 patients [64%]). Common prior regimens were rituximab plus bendamus- tine(64patients[50%]),R-CHOP(48patients[37%]),and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide and prednisone (38 patients [30%]). Six patients (5%) had prior autologous stem-cell transplantation. Nearlyallpatientshaddiseaserefractorytorituximabeither aloneorincombination(127patients[98%]),119patients (92%) had disease refractory to an alkylating agent or purine analog, and 117 patients (91%) had disease re- fractory to combination therapy with rituximab and an alkylating agent. Nearly all patients had disease refractory to the most recent regimen (124 patients [96%]), and 95 patients (77%) had disease refractory to two or more reg- imens. Among the 39 patients with FL who received an R-CHOP (or equivalent) chemoimmunotherapy regimen as first therapy, 30 (77%) experienced early relapse (no responseduringtreatmentorPDortimetonexttreatment lessthan2years).Nonotabledifferencesindemographics were observed across lymphoma subtypes. Disposition Of 171 screened patients, 42 were excluded as a result of screen failures, yielding 129 in the full analysis set. of the May 2018 data cutoff, five patients were still on treatment. Of the 124 who discontinued treatment, ap- proximately one half (66 patients [51.2%]) did so because ofPD; one fourth (31 patients [24%]) because of AEs; and the remaining one fourth because of investigator decision, death, patient withdrawal, or noncompliance. As of May 2018, 33 patients (25.6%) remained in the survival follow- up (Appendix Fig A1, online only). Efficacy Medianfollow-uptime(fromfirstdoseuntillastcontactdate or death) was 32.1 months.

',\n"," 'Five deaths (3.9%) were considered treatment related: a 90-year-old man developed fatal pancolitis, an 82-year-old man experienced a fatal sus- pected viral infection after approximately 8 months of treatment, and an 83-year-old man with baseline grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia experienced fatal septic shock after only 21 days of treatment. The remaining two deaths were from severe skin toxicity as a result of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. However, both events were confounded by concomitant administration of medications associated with severe and fatal drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. One additional treatment-related death as a result of pneumonia occurred approximately 36 days after the last dose of duvelisib. DISCUSSION Although most patients with iNHL initially respond to chemoimmunotherapy and experience long periods of remission, virtually all will eventually progress or develop recurrentdisease. 27,28 Despiteseveralapprovedoptionsfor relapsed iNHL, cumulative toxicities from multiple thera- pies and resistance or transformation to high-grade or aggressive lymphomas remain major challenges. 29,30 With fewpatientseligibleforpotentiallycurativeallogeneicstem- cell transplantation, new therapies are needed. The DYNAMO study evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral duvelisib monotherapy in patients whose disease had become refractory to standard therapies and, therefore, represent the greatest unmet need. Among a heavily pretreated and high-risk iNHL study population, the ORR was 47% (two CRs, 59 PRs), and lymph node disease was reducedin83%ofpatients.Responsesgenerallyoccurred within the first 2 months of therapy and were durable (median DOR, 10 months). The safety profile was similar across lymphoma subtypes andconsistentwiththatobservedinthephaseIIPI-145-02 study. 23,24 AEs were generally low grade and manageable with protocol-specified risk mitigation measures, including dose reductions/interruptions (70% of patients).

Among patients with FL, 27 (33%) experienced early progression (less than 2 years after initial diagnosis) after frontline R-CHOP(orequivalent)therapyandrepresentapopulation with substantially poorer OS. This extent of treatment re- fractoriness and the prevalence of other high-risk clinical features (eg, high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk and elevated lactate dehydrogenase) distinguish a more difficult-to-treat study population. examination of efficacy in the subgroup of patients with FL who received R-CHOP (or the equivalent) as their first therapy and experienced early relapse (as defined in Discussion) showed an ORR of 33%, median DOR of 12.6 months, and median PFS of 8.2 months. With the recent FDA approval of duvelisib, there are now several different treatment options for patients who have received two or more prior therapies: in addition to duve- lisib,thePI3Kinhibitorscopanlisib(intravenousinhibitorof PI3K-a,-d)andidelalisib(oralinhibitorofPI3K-d).Although these three new treatment options are important for both physicians and patients, evaluating them side by side for the treatment of FL is challenging because cross-trial comparisons are undermined by variability in patient se- lection and treatments. For instance, in the phase II CHRONOS-1 study, copanlisib demonstrated an ORR of 59%. Although prior rituximab and alkylator therapy was required, only 56% and 42% of patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab and an alkylating agent, re- spectively. In addition, the AE profile of copanlisib, specifically including hyperglycemic effects mediated through PI3K-a isoform inhibition 33,34 and hypertension, merits consideration before use in an elderly patient populationwithahighprevalenceofthesecomorbidities.In a phase II trial in patients with disease refractory to both rituximab and chemotherapy, idelalisib demonstrated an ORR of 57%. The AE profile was similar to duvelisib, except for a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher ami- notransferase increase with idelalisib (13% v 5.4%). Al- though many new therapies are being investigated for patients with RR indolent lymphoma (lenalidomide and rituximab, cellular therapies, bispecific antibodies, and other small molecules), treatment options beyond the PI3Kinhibitorsarestilllimited.RITrarelyisused,andone of the two FDA-approved therapies was withdrawn from the market for lack of use. The cumulative toxicities and decreasing efficacy of repeating cytotoxic chemotherapy, even combined with a different CD20 antibody like obi- nutuzumab, does not make this an attractive choice either. ',\n"," 'Thecombinationofobinutuzumabandbendamustinewas recentlyapprovedforpatientswithFLwhorelapsedafteror whose disease proved refractory to a rituximab-containing regimen on the basis of the results of the GADOLIN (Efficacy and Safety of Bendamustine Compared With Bendamustine + Obinutuzumab [GA101] in Rituximab- Refractory, Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) study. Given that the bendamustine and rituximab regimen is increasingly used as first-line treatment of FL in the United States, duvelisib monotherapy may offer an alternative for the considerable number of patients whose disease is re- fractory to bendamustine or who are unable to tolerate bendamustine. Patients previously treated with bend- amustine had an ORR of 39% per IRC. Although this was nominally lower than what was seen in patients not pre- viously exposed to bendamustine, it nevertheless suggests that duvelisib has clinical activity for a population not ap- propriate for treatment with bendamustine therapy. Despite recent therapeutic advances, iNHL remains largely incurable, with treatment resistance and cumu- lative toxicity limiting options for many patients.

',\n"," 'beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan, a component of the fungal cell wall, has been shown to stimulate the immune system, enhance hematopoiesis, amplify killing of opsonized tumor cells and increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion. In view of these attributes, the beta-glucans should be studied for both their therapeutic efficacy in patients with cancer as well as an adjunctive therapy in patients receiving chemotherapy as a maneuver to limit suppression of hematopoiesis. In this study, twenty patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy were given a beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan preparation (MacroForce plus IP6, ImmuDyne, Inc.) and monitored for tolerability and effect on hematopoiesis. Our results lead us to conclude that beta-glucan is well-tolerated in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, may have a beneficial effect on hematopoiesis in these patients and should be studied further, especially in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan is a long chain polymer of glucose from the fungal cell wall which has been shown to have a number of immunomodulatory properties as well as effects on hematopoiesis and as a radiation protectant. It has been well-demonstrated that the beta-glucans increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, synergize with myeloid growth factors to enhance hematopoiesis and mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells in vivo, directly stimulate committed myeloid progenitor cells and improve survival and hematopoietic regeneration in irradiated mice. Furthermore, the beta-glucans have been shown to amplify the phagocytic killing of opsonized tumor cells and combine with monoclonal antibodies to increase their tumoricidal activity. Based on these properties, this study was designed to test the safety of an adjunctive treatment with beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. In addition, because the beta-glucans have been shown to improve hematopoiesis in animals and because chemotherapy generally induces cytopenias in humans, we also sought to determine if the beta-glucan administered in this study exerted an effect on blood counts in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy compared with pretreatment blood counts in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Twenty patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy received the beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan preparation, MacroForce plus IP6 (ImmuDyne, Mount Kisco, NY), one tablet twice a day by mouth after granting informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Group.

Specifically, patients were asked to report any new symptoms not experienced prior to initiation of the study and to note if any prior chemotherapy-related symptoms (e.g. nausea and vomiting) had changed after the intiation of the study. If grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity developed, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1000 uL or a platelet count of less than 50,000 uL, therapy would be withheld until the toxicity resolved. After resolution, dosing would be reduced to one tablet by mouth per day. Mean changes in blood counts during the study were compared to the mean blood counts observed prior to the initiation of the study. The primary endpoint was to determine the tolerability of the treatment and its effect on serial blood counts. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient for publication of this study. Table 1 demonstrates the characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study. Table 2 notes the types of malignancies experienced by these patients and the treatments they were receiving. None of the twenty patients reported any new symptoms while taking the beta-glucan. Sixty per cent of the patients reported a sense of well-being while taking the beta-glucan and asked to remain on the treatment even after the completion of the study. Forty per cent of the patients who experienced fatigue during their chemotherapy treatments prior to entering the study reported feeling less fatigued while taking the beta-glucan. In addition, one patient with lymphoma and significant cervical adenopathy who delayed his standard chemotherapy for 4 weeks during the study and only took the beta-glucan, noted a marked reduction in the size of the nodes while taking the beta-glucan alone. Table 3 shows the comparison of the mean blood counts prior to entering the study with the mean blood counts during the study. As can be seen, in general, there was a trend to improved blood counts during the study as compared with the pre-study period. ',\n"," 'improvement especially of the white blood count during the study period on this dose of beta-glucan. Improvements were also noted in the levels of hemoglobin and the platelet counts. The beta-glucans are long-chain polymers of glucose in beta-(1,3)(1,6) linkages which comprise the fungal cell wall. These glucans have been studied for their ability stimulate hematopoiesis, protect against radiation injury and amplify killing of opsonized tumor cells. It has been shown that these glucans can increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion in several in vivo and in vitro systems. In addition, betafectin PGG-glucan was able to synergize with myeloid growth factors in vivo to enhance hematopoietic recovery and mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells. Treatment with glucans in mice has been shown to increase survival and improve hematopoietic regeneration after irradiation and that the glucans act directly on commited myeloid progenitors to improve hematopoiesis. The effects of glucans on tumor cell killing has included the observation that yeast beta-glucan amplifies phagocytic killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells, combine with monoclonal antibodies to increase tumor cell death and can increase macrophage cytotoxicity to tumor cells by increasing nitrous oxide production. Interestingly, toxicological assessment of a particulate yeast (1,3)-beta-D-glucan in rats revealed no adverse or toxic effects on the animals. The specific aim of this study was to determine the safety and side effect profile of beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy and the effect of the glucan on hemtopoiesis in these patients. Furthermore, because the beta-glucans also have immunomodulatory effects as noted above, we monitored patients for any therapeutic effect of the glucan even though this was an uncontrolled trial and this was not a specific aim of the treatment paradigm. This trial demonstrates that beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan is extremely well-tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. No adverse effects or toxicities were reported by any of the patients when compared to their symptom profile before entering the study. On the contrary, a significant number of patients reported a sense of well-being while taking the glucan, an effect which should be studied further in a larger, controlled trial. There clearly was some amelioration of the blood counts in patients taking the glucan as compared to the pretreatment mean counts. This effect supports the data from animal studies which demonstrates that the beta-glucans improve hematopoiesis through a variety of mechanisms. ',\n"," 'This effect should also be studied in a larger, controlled trial because if confirmed, the beta-glucans could become an important adjunctive treatment in patients receiving chemotherapy to limit the cytopenias observed with these therapies. Lastly, because of the immunomodulatory properties of the glucans, these agents may have direct tumoricidal properties which deserve further investigation in a larger population in a controlled setting. Our anecdotal experience in one patient with lymphoma and enlarged cervical nodes who noted marked improvement on the beta-glucan alone is extremely interesting at the very least. We conclude that beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan can be safely administered to patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy and that this adjunctive therapy may have beneficial effects on the blood counts in these patients. Further studies are warranted in a larger patient population to confirm this latter finding and to determine if the beta-glucans have tumoricidal effects in humans. ',\n"," 'MGCD0103, an orally available class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was examined for pre-clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). A phase II clinical trial was performed, starting at a dose of 85 mg/day, three times per week. Dose escalation to 110 mg or the addition of rituximab was permitted in patients without a response after 2 or more cycles. MGCD0103 demonstrated pre-clinical activity against CLL cells with a LC50 (concentration lethal to 50%) of 0.23 muM and increased acetylation of the HDAC class I specific target histone H3. Twenty-one patients received a median of 2 cycles of MGCD0103 (range, 0-12). All patients had previously received fludarabine, 33% were fludarabine refractory, and 71% had del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1). No responses according to the National Cancer Institutes 1996 criteria were observed. Three patients received 110 mg and 4 patients received concomitant rituximab, with no improvement in response. Grade 3-4 toxicity consisted of infections, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, and fatigue. HDAC inhibition was observed in 6 out of 9 patients on day 8. Limited activity was observed with single agent MGCD0103 in high risk patients with CLL. Future investigations in CLL should focus on broad HDAC inhibition, combination strategies, and approaches to diminish constitutional symptoms associated with this class of drugs. Historically, loss of tumour suppressor genes and genomic silencing via DNA mutation or deletion have been thought to contribute to tumorigenesis by permitting apoptotic escape, sustained growth, limitless replication, immunological evasion, and metastasis of the malignant cell. However, epigenetic modifications that favour transcriptionally repressive chromatin are also common in neoplastic transformation, particularly in B-cell malignancies. CpG island promoter methylation and post-translational modifications of histone proteins alter chromatin conformation, favouring transcriptional repression and genomic silencing. Eukaryotic DNA is condensed 10,000-fold via the nucleosome, a histone octamer consisting of a histone H3 and H4 tetramer and two histone H2A and H2B dimers. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins including histone acetylation are critical to transcriptional regulation of genes. Histone acetylation and histone deacyetylation regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) leads to either transcriptionally active hyperacetylated chromatin or transcriptionally repressive hypoacetylated chromatin, respectively. ',\n"," 'Four classes of HDACs remove acetyl groups from lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histones in protein repressor and chromatin remodeling complexes including HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8 (class I isotypes located within the nucleus); HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 (class II isotypes which shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus), Sirt 1 to 7 (class III istoypes), and HDAC 11 (class IV isotype). While genomic deletions and mutations irreversibly alter the sequence of a gene, histone modifications can be readily targeted by therapies that inhibit histone deacetylation. In addition to nuclear modification of histone proteins, several of the class II HDAC enzymes can also alter acetylation on cytoplasmic proteins. Given the robust number of proteins targeted by HDAC isotypes, agents that target HDAC enzymes represent a novel target for anti-cancer therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors, including depsipeptide (a potent inhibitor of class I HDAC enzymes), MS-275 (a selective class I HDAC inhibitor), and valproic acid (a non-selective HDAC inhibitor), can alter histone modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lead to selective cytotoxicity of CLL cells. Depsipeptide has led to reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, a dose-dependent increase in acetylation of total histone H4, and inhibition of global HDAC activity. Depsipeptide-induced apoptosis in CLL appears to occur through activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8, with minimal alteration in caspase 9 activity. Therefore, the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide utilizes the tumour necrosis factor-receptor pathway of apoptosis to activate caspase 8, which leads to recruitment of caspase 3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). The observation that depsipeptide operates via a caspase 8-mediated process is significant, as this pathway is not activated by other agents currently used in the treatment of CLL, which more frequently activate the mitochondrial/caspase 9-dependent pathway of apoptosis. MGCD0103 is an orally available, aminophenylbenzamide small molecule HDAC inhibitor that selectively targets class I (HDAC isotypes 1, 2, and 3) and class IV (HDAC isotype 11) enzymes. In pre-clinical testing, intermittent dosing schedules have led to sustained dose-dependent growth inhibition in a variety of human cancer cell lines and implanted tumors in mice. Previously conducted phase I trials of MGCD0103 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and solid tumours have evaluated three times per week dosing schedules with dose levels ranging from 12.5 - 80 mg/m2/day every 21 days. ',\n"," 'schedules with dose levels ranging from 12.5 - 80 mg/m2/day every 21 days. Maximum tolerated doses were 60 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2/day in AML and solid tumours, respectively, with dose-limiting toxicities consisting of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Using fixed MGCD0103 dosing, the recommended phase 2 doses were 110 mg in AML and 85 mg in solid tumours. As a result of the compelling evidence supporting the role of epigenetic silencing in CLL and the feasibility of intermittent dosing in patients with AML and solid tumours, a multi-centre phase II trial of MGCD103 was conducted in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL to determine the overall response rate. In addition, in patients not initially responding to MGCD0103, combination therapy with rituximab and MGCD0103 was explored with the therapeutic rationale that MGCD0103 and rituximab induce apoptosis through different pathways and have non-overlapping toxicities. While HDAC inhibitors induce apoptosis in CLL cells through activation of caspase 8 and 3, rituximab-induced CLL apoptosis occurs through the caspase 9 effector pathway. In addition, declines in Mcl-1 following rituximab therapy may further sensitize CLL cells to MGCD0103 cytotoxicity. Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL, following written informed consent. Leukemic B-cells were negatively selected using RosetteSep reagent (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). Cells were incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin, and 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and immunoblots were performed as described andLC50 (concentration lethal to 50%) was calculated using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Antibodies including acetylated tubulin (Sigma) acetylated H3 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), and GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Patients 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed CLL, relapsed or refractory after at least one prior nucleoside-analog containing therapy (unless nucleoside analogs were contraindicated) and requiring treatment according to National Cancer Institutes (NCI) criteria were enrolled. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, a total bilirubin <= 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <= 2.5 x ULN, and a serum creatinine <= 1.5 x ULN. ',\n"," 'The institutional review boards of all participating centres approved the trial and all patients provided written informed consent as per institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients received MGCD0103 at a starting dose of 85 mg three times per week (TIW) for four weeks. Twenty-eight days defined a cycle. Dose escalation to 110 mg TIW was permitted beginning with cycle 2 in patients who failed to achieve a complete response (CR) and who had no grade 2 or higher adverse events. In patients without evidence of response after dose escalation to 110 mg (unless dose escalation was contra-indicated due to toxicity), rituximab was administered. Rituximab dosing started at 100 mg over 4 h on day 1, followed by 375 mg/m2 days 3, 5, and then three times a week for a maximum of 12 doses. Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Anti-emetic, anti-diarrhoeal, and hematopoietic growth factor support were provided at the discretion of the treating physician. In patients with grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, MGCD0103 was withheld until improvement of the toxicity to <= grade 1. For subsequent cycles, dose reduction by either one (60mg) or two (40mg) dose levels was required for the first and second events, respectively. Dose reduction below 40 mg was not permitted and grade 4 non-hematological toxicity necessitated study removal. In patients with pre-treatment platelet count > 75 x 109/l and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 2.0 x 109/l, the development of grade 4 cytopenias persisting for more than 7 days required cessation of MGCD0103 until hematological recovery defined as >= 75% of baseline or <= grade 1. At resumption of therapy, patients were dose-reduced by one dose level to either 60 or 40 mg of MGCD0103. In patients with baseline pre-treatment platelet counts <= 75 x 109/l or ANC <= 2.0 x 109/l, cytopenias < 75% of baseline led to cessation of MGCD0103 therapy until recovery to >= 75% of baseline or <= grade 1. Treatment resumed at the next lower dose level, but dose reductions below 40 mg required study removal. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and liver function tests were monitored weekly during the first two cycles of therapy and with dose escalation to 110 mg or the addition of rituximab. Starting with cycle 3, blood counts, chemistries, and liver function tests were assessed on days 1 and 15. ',\n"," 'Twelve lead electrocardiograms were performed pre-treatment; prior to dosing, 1- and 2-h post-dose on day 1 of cycles 1-2; and prior to dosing for cycles 3 and beyond. Response was assessed according to the revised NCI Working Group Criteria after every cycle, with bone marrow biopsy repeated to confirm CR or after every 4 cycles of therapy. Hematological and non-hematological toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf). Peripheral blood evaluations of whole cell HDAC enzyme activity and cytokine analysis were assessed pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 8, and at completion of protocol therapy. Bone marrow aspirations were collected pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 8, and at end of study therapy were used to qualify changes in HDAC activity over time. Whole cell HDAC enzyme assays were performed as previously described. Plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from eBioscience San Diego, CA). This study was a multi-institutional single-arm phase II study designed to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) with MGCD0103 in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The study was designed according to Simon\\'s two-stage design, targeting a true response probability of >= 20%, with null hypothesis that the true response rate was < 5 %.\"] The study had a type 1 error rate of 5% and power of 90%. According to the study design, study closure was required if fewer than 2 responses were observed in the first 21 patients. If sufficient responses were observed in stage 1, a total study enrollment of 41 patients was planned, with observation of 5 or more responses considered worthy of further evaluation. CLL cells from untreated patients (n=8) were incubated for 72 hours with or without various concentrations of MGCD0103, and viability was assessed by MTT assay. Under these conditions, the LC50 was 0.23 muM (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.31) relative to time-matched controls. To assess acetylation of known HDAC class I and II targets, CLL patient cells (n=4) were treated with MGCD0103 at several concentrations. Lysates were prepared after a 16-h incubation, prior to the time when cell death is observed by annexin/PI flow cytometry data (data not shown). By immunoblot analysis, MGCD0103 treatment induced acetylation of the HDAC class I substrate histone H3 but not the class II target tubulin (Figure 1). ',\n"," 'These data confirm that at the doses examined, MGCD0103 causes class I HDAC target hyperacetylation followed by cell death. Twenty-one patients completed a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range 0-12). Three patients were dose escalated to 110 mg and 4 patients received rituximab beginning in cycle 4 (range, 2-8 doses) for lack of response to single agent MGCD0103. In the twenty-one patients, the median age was 63 (range, 48-80) years and 20 patients had Rai stage 3-4 disease (Table 1). Most patients were heavily pre-treated, receiving a median of 5 prior therapies (range, 1-13) and 13 (62%) patients failed to respond to the prior treatment regimen. No patients were previously transplanted. All 21 patients had received fludarabine, and seven (33%) patients failed to respond to their last fludarabine-containing regimen. The majority of patients had adverse cytogenetics, with 15 (71%) patients with either del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1), and 3 patients with both deletion 11q and 17p (Table 1). In the cohort of 21 patients, there were no complete or partial responses. Twenty patients had stable disease, and no improvement in response occurred with either MGCD0103 dose escalation or the addition of rituximab. Median pre- and post-treatment white blood cell, absolute lymphocyte, and platelet counts were 30.6 x 109/l and 34 x 109/l (white blood cells); 27.5 x 109/l and 31.3 x 109/l (absolute lymphocyte count); and 49 x 109/l and 38 x 109/l) (platelets), respectively. Four patients who received 5, 2, 2, and 1 cycles of MGCD0103 had 73.4%, 36.7%, 93.9%, and 55.4% declines, respectively, in absolute lymphocyte counts. All of these patients stopped therapy due to toxicity including infection, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. In addition, four patients with stable disease were also able to continue MGCD0103 for 5, 7, 9 and 12 cycles, respectively. Fifty-nine MGCD0103 cycles were completed. Six patients required dose reduction by one dose level to 60 mg three times a week, 1 patient required two dose reductions to 40 mg three times a week, and 16 patients had dosing delays primarily due to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), fatigue, anorexia, infections, or thrombocytopenia. There were no treatment-related deaths. Grade 3-4 hematological events included thrombocytopenia (29%), anemia (29%), and neutropenia (5%, Table 2). Non-hematological grade 3 or 4 adverse events were uncommon (Table 2), with infection (39%), febrile neutropenia (20%), diarrhoea (10%), fatigue (10%), and abdominal pain (5%) occurring most frequently. ',\n"," 'The majority of the grade 1-2 adverse events were also gastrointestinal, constitutional, or infectious, including diarrhoea (n=16), nausea (n=16), non-neutropenic infections (n=13), anorexia (n=10), vomiting (n=7), rash (n=10), fatigue (n=7), abdominal pain (n=6), weight loss (n=5), headache (n=5), and oedema (n=5). With respect to cardiac complications, no evidence of QT prolongation was observed. Only three patients experienced cardiac events. One patient, with a history of pulmonary hypertension that was probably secondary to bronchiectasis, developed grade 3 right ventricular failure with pleural effusions and oedema that was thought to be related to the pre-existing pulmonary disease. A second patient with a history of hypertension developed a grade 1 asymptomatic pericardial effusion on echocardiogram that resolved after discontinuation of the study drug and a third patient developed grade 2 ventricular tachycardia and grade 2 bradycardia in the setting of grade 4 influenza and bacterial meningitis. Infections were common, with 2 deaths attributed to pneumonia. Reported grade 3-5 infections were febrile neutropenia (n=4), pneumonia (n=3), influenza (n=2), meningitis (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), and methicillin-resistant Stapholoccocus epidermidis bacteremia (n=1). Grade 1-2 infections included pneumonia (n=3), urinary tract infections (n=3), sinusitis (n=2), otitis externa (n=1), oral candidasis (n=1), orchitis/epididymitis (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), and folliculitis (n=1). Bone marrow basal HDAC activity levels were comparable to those in peripheral white blood cells in the same patients (Table 3). The mean change in HDAC enzyme inhibition in 9 patients with pre-treatment and post-treatment (day 8) samples available was 24.5% (range -5.5% to 51.5%, Figure 2). In 6 of these 9 patients, HDAC inhibition greater than 20% was observed relative to pre-treatment values (Figure 2). In 21 patients, pre-treatment IL-6 plasma levels varied (ranging from < 1ng/l to 155.8 ng/l). IL-6 levels failed to correlate with fatigue; however, in 5 of 6 patients with grades 3-4 fever, IL-6 levels were increased 10-fold compared to pre-treatment levels. Preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors in CLL in vitro has been published by several groups. In a clinical trial with depsipeptide, a class I specific HDAC inhibitor, modest evidence of clinical efficacy was demonstrated, but problematic fatigue and cardiac toxicity has limited its further development. Due to this toxicity, alternative class I HDAC inhibitors, including MGCD0103, are under evaluation in CLL. In the current study, pre-clinical activity in CLL cells was demonstrated, with loss of tumor cell viability and hyperacetylation of histone H3 after MGCD0103 exposure. ',\n"," 'This pre-clinical efficacy justified the pursuit of the herein described multi-center phase II trial of MGCD0103 in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. Unfortunately in this phase II trial, limited single agent efficacy was observed, with stable disease in 20 of 21 patients after 0-12 cycles of MGCD0103. Prolonged administration for 5 or more cycles, dose escalation to 110 mg, and the addition of rituximab failed to improve MGCD0103\\'s activity.\"] Collectively, this study, together with the previous trial of the more potent class I HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide, suggests that alternative strategies using HDAC inhibitors in patients with CLL will be required including pursuit of non-selective or broad HDAC isotype inhibition or combination strategies based upon pre-clinical synergy studies with other novel targeted therapies. Although four patients did demonstrate reductions lymphocyte count that could be construed as clinical benefit, constitutional symptoms associated with MGCD0103 were significant and frequently led to cessation of therapy. Despite the prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-life of MGCD0103 when compared to other HDAC inhibitors, which permits three times a week rather than daily oral dosing, dose escalation and re-treatment with MGCD0103 in this trial were often prohibited by these side effects including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, and severe fatigue. Such toxicities are similarly found with other class I HDAC inhibitors including depsipeptide in patients with CLL and in previous MGCD0103 phase I and II trials in AML, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumours. In these trials, maximal or sustained HDAC inhibition with optimal steady state dose levels may not have been achievable due to toxicity, suggesting that alternative prolonged dosing schedules of HDAC inhibitors may enhance the clinical activity and HDAC enzyme inhibition with these agents in patients with CLL. In the current trial, the majority of patients could only tolerate up to 2 cycles of MGCD0103; however, four patients remained on study for 5-12 cycles, with no additional efficacy observed despite prolonged dosing in these 4 patients. In pharmacodynamic evaluations in patient-derived peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells in 6 of 9 patients with available samples on this trial, greater than 20% inhibition of HDAC activity was observed. It remains unclear if the 20% threshold is sufficient for therapeutic efficacy and further evaluation is warranted. ',\n"," 'Therefore, despite intermittent three times a week dosing of MGCD0103 that permitted several patients to remain on study for 5 or more cycles and preliminary evidence of HDAC inhibition, efficacy with this agent was limited in CLL, suggesting that either combination strategies with class I HDAC inhibitors or use of non-selective HDAC inhibitors may be necessary to fully appreciate the benefit of this class of agents in patients with relapsed CLL. Additionally, efforts to understand and effectively eliminate the constitutional symptoms observed with class I specific HDAC inhibitors in CLL will be important for prolonged therapy to be feasible. The lack of response with MGCD0103 as a single agent in CLL raises the question of how to continue development of HDAC inhibitors in CLL. Combination strategies with HDAC inhibitors are currently in development in other hematological malignancies including combinations of HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, cell cycle regulatory agents (i.e. flavopiridol), anti-apoptotic agents, bortezomib, and conventional chemotherapeutic agents. These combination strategies may synergize with respect to inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity, ultimately permitting the use of less frequent and smaller doses of HDAC inhibitors which may not only improve the clinical efficacy of these agents but also limit cumulative toxicity. While consideration of HDAC inhibitor combinations with flavopiridol are reasonable given the clinical activity of this agent in CLL, alternative agents, such as bortezomib or the hypomethylating agent decitabine, are less attractive due to the lack of single agent activity. In a subset of patients on this trial, the addition of rituximab to MGCD0103 was well tolerated, and this may also be incorporated into future combination approaches. ',\n"," 'Based on the hypothesis that bortezomib may potentiate fludarabine activity by inhibiting DNA repair, we designed a phase I trial using this combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory indolent and mantle cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes included 12 patients with follicular, 4 with marginal zone, 3 with lymphoplasmacytic, 3 with mantle cell and 2 with small lymphocytic / chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fludarabine and bortezomib were escalated in cohorts of 3 patients. Rituximab was added to the maximum tolerated dose of fludarabine and bortezomib and added significant dose-limiting myelosuppression. The maximum tolerated dose was fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11, with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 administered every 21 days. Clinical responses were observed in 11 patients, 5 of whom were refractory to their most recent treatment regimen. Six additional patients had stable disease for a median of 10 months (range 4-30+). Cumulative myelosuppression and neuropathy was observed. Fludarabine, bortezomib, and rituximab appears to be an active regimen with manageable toxicity for relapsed NHL. The indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) traditionally include follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic and small lymphocytic histological subtypes. They are defined by their chemosensitive nature and slowly progressive course. Despite a wide variety of treatment options, most patients ultimately succumb to their disease. In comparison, mantle cell lymphoma is considerably more aggressive than the indolent NHLs and less responsive to currently available therapy. As new treatment options with novel targets and non-overlapping toxicities are developed, the armamentarium of effective salvage therapies is steadily increasing. However, the most effective and least toxic of these regimens has yet to be defined. Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid that is a specific and selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. It is the first of the proteasome inhibitors to be used clinically and has demonstrated considerable efficacy in the treatment of indolent and mantle cell NHL. This data led to the FDA approval of bortezomib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib affects malignant cells through multiple mechanisms including the regulation of proteins involved in cell cycle progression (p21, p27), oncogenesis (p53, IkB) and apoptosis (Bcl-2, cIAP, XIAP, Bax). In addition, bortezomib may act by inhibiting DNA repair kinases (DNA-PKcs, ATM). ',\n"," 'Further, pre-clinical data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may serve as a regulator for DNA damage repair, supporting the use of bortezomib in combination with cytotoxic agents. Fludarabine is a potent cytotoxic agent which acts by inhibiting DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, thus terminating DNA strand replication. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line models, synergistic cytotoxicity has been observed with the combination of fludarabine and bortezomib. Bortezomib may inhibit repair of the fludarabine induced DNA lesions, thereby enhancing its anti-neoplastic effect. Other potential synergistic mechanisms include down-regulation of XIAP and up-regulation of Bid, resulting in enhanced apoptosis. In vitro data suggest that down-regulation of the NF-kB pathway, a known result of proteasome inhibition, may reverse fludarabine resistance. Rituximab in combination with bortezomib, appears to be well tolerated given non-overlapping toxicities. Further, synergistic apoptosis has been observed pre-clinically when bortezomib was added to a rituximab-containing combination. We therefore initiated a phase I study of fludarabine, bortezomib and rituximab in relapsed and refractory indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma. This phase I trial was designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of bortezomib in combination with rituximab and fludarabine. Secondary objectives included overall response and clinical benefit rates. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and written informed consent was obtained before enrollment. Patients 18 years of age or older with a confirmed indolent NHL (including grade 1 or 2 follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic and small lymphocytic / chronic lymphocytic leukemia) who had relapsed or had been refractory (defined as no response, or progression within 6 months of completing therapy) to at least 1 standard therapy were candidates for this study. Also included were patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, aside from those with the blastic variant. Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and to have measurable disease. Baseline laboratory parameters included an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/muL, platelets >= 75,000/muL, and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients were excluded for the following conditions: radiation, chemotherapy, or monoclonal antibody therapy within the previous 4 weeks or radioimmunotherapy within the previous 3 months; previous bortezomib therapy; a history of uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension; grade 2 or higher neuropathy; prior allogeneic transplant; CNS lymphoma; serious infection including HIV disease; pregnancy or breast feeding.

It was administered by intravenous push over 5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 followed by a 10 days rest period. Fludarabine was handled as directed by the package insert and material safety data sheet and administered at 25 mg/m2 intravenously as a 30 minute infusion daily for 3 or 5 days of each 21 day cycle. Rituximab was handled as directed by the package insert and material safety data sheet and administered at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle per a standardized infusion protocol. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or to a maximum of 8 cycles. Hematopoetic growth factors were not allowed during cycle one and were administered at the treating physician's discretion thereafter. Dose escalation is depicted in Table 1. Cohorts of 3-6 patients were treated at each dose level. For dose escalation to proceed, 3 patients had to complete cycle 1 without a DLT. If one DLT was observed, then an additional 3 patients were accrued, and further escalation occurred if no additional DLTs were seen. If DLT was observed in 2 of 3-6 patients enrolled at a specific dose level during cycle 1, that step was considered the dose-limiting level. A total of 6 patients were treated at the dose below the DLT level, thus establishing the MTD. Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. DLT was defined as any grade 3 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity and grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurring within the first cycle. Grade 4 lymphopenia and anemia were not considered DLTs. The MTD was defined as one dose level below the level determined to be the DLT. Assessment of response was performed after every 2 cycles of treatment. Response was defined using the International Workshop NHL criteria. For patients with CLL, the National Cancer Institute working group guidelines were used to determine a response. Time to disease progression was calculated as the number of months from the initiation of therapy to the first documentation of disease progression, death regardless of cause or change in therapy, whichever occurred first. Twenty-four patients were enrolled onto the study between July 2003 and July 2008. \",\n"," 'Patient characteristics are listed in Table 2. The mean age was 62 (range, 36-87) years and 13 patients were >60 years old. All patients were assessable for toxicity. Patients received an average of 3.5 cycles (range, 1-8) and 20 patients who received 2 or more cycles were assessable for clinical response. The mean number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range, 1-7). Twenty-three patients had previously received rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan, 8 patients had previously received fludarabine. Twelve patients were refractory to their most recent treatment. Of these, 10 patients were refractory to rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan and 2 to fludarabine. Five patients had failed an autologous stem cell transplant. Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities are depicted in Tables 3 and 4. No DLTs were observed on dose steps 1 through 4. With the addition of rituximab at dose level 5, 2 patients experienced DLTs including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient as well as neutropenia and neuropathy in another. After independent review and consultation with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, dose steps 5a and 5b were added in which doses of fludarabine and bortezomib were attenuated. Nine additional patients were treated, 3 at level 5a and 6 at 5b. One additional DLT, grade 3 dyspnea, was observed at the dose 5b. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity, with neutropenia being dose limiting. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 24% and 17% of cycles respectively and appeared to be cumulative in nature. Six patients received filgrastim or pegylated filgrastim support after demonstrating prolonged neutropenia during the first cycle of therapy, 4 of whom were treated on rituximab containing dose levels. Five patients were removed from the study due to prolonged myelosuppression, preventing initiation of the subsequent cycle within the protocol specified 5 week time period. As expected, all patients developed grade 3/4 lymphopenia. The major non-hematologic toxicities were neurologic and infectious in etiology. The peripheral neuropathy was predominately sensory in nature, more prone to develop in patients with previous sensory neuropathies and appeared cumulative as well. Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy developed in 9 patients, 6 of which had received prior vincristine. This contributed to the decision to discontinue protocol treatment in 6 cases. It was partially reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. One patient treated at dose level 5 experienced an increase in his pre-existing grade 1 peripheral neuropathy to grade 3 during cycle 1. ',\n"," \"This decreased to baseline with a dose reduction of bortezomib. Two additional patients experienced grade 3 orthostatic hypotension possibly due to drug-induced autonomic neuropathy. Both patients' symptoms resolved with therapy cessation. The overall incidence of grade 3 infection was 6% (5 of 86 cycles). These included 1 oropharyngeal infection, 1 cellulitis, 1 periodontal abscess and 2 episodes of culture negative neutropenic fever. In two instances, patients were removed from the trial following a >5 week period without initiation of the next course of treatment. Other grade 3 toxicites included grade 3 dyspnea potentially related to bortezomib in a patient treated at dose level 5b, grade 3 diarrhea in 2 patients, and one episode each of fatigue, hypoglycemia, and an infusion related rituximab reaction. One patient experienced grade 3 pain related to progressive disease, not believed to be neurologic in etiology. The only grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities included 5 episodes of hyperglycemia, all occurring in a single patient with diabetes mellitus after receiving glucocorticoids as part of her anti-emetic regime. Dose modifications or delays in therapy occurred in 34 of the 86 cycles (40%). Bortezomib was dose reduced in 16 cycles and individual doses were held 26 times for a delivered dose intensity of 88%. In addition, there were a total of 17 weekly delays in therapy. The most common reasons for interruptions in therapy were neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (55% of cases) as well as peripheral neuropathy (32%). Objective responses were observed in 11 patients (Table 5 and 6) for an overall response rate of 45% (95% CI: 0.28 - 0.65) with a clinical benefit rate (complete remissions + partial remissions + stable disease) of 71% (17/24) with 95% CI: 0.51 - 0.86. Two of the 3 patients achieving a complete response have no signs of relapsed disease at 1 and 3 years respectively despite both having been heavily pre-treated including receiving high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Six of the responding patients went on to receive additional therapy. One patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem transplantation and another patient received an umbilical cord blood transplant. Both remain in remission for >5 years. Two patients received additional immunochemotherapy, including fludarabine rituximab and rituximab EPOCH respectively, and 2 patients received further rituximab given in maintenance fashion. Six patients were classified as having stable disease with a median time of 10 months (range 4-30+). \",\n"," 'Of the 12 patients with disease refractory to their most recent regimen, 1 complete response, 4 partial responses, and 3 patients with stable disease (of 4, 5, and 6 months respectively) were observed. Proteasome inhibition affects a variety of cell-signaling pathways via inhibition of proteolysis. Among its pro-apoptotic effects, bortezomib may increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy through the inhibition of DNA repair. Induction of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity, resulting in activation of caspase-3, led to cleavage of the DNA repair enzymes DNA-PKcs and ATM. Further, clinical and laboratory investigations have demonstrated bortezomib to sensitize lymphoma and multiple myeloma cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, reversing drug resistance in some cases. Based on the previously demonstrated efficacy of bortezomib in indolent and mantle cell NHL as well as the potential for bortezomib to inhibit repair of fludarabine-induced DNA strand breaks, we conducted this phase I study in NHL patients with relapsed or refractory disease and determined the MTD to be fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1. The addition of rituximab added significantly to the myelotoxicity of this regimen. Rituximab related neutropenia is a rare complication associated with single agent use and may occur months after administration. Delayed onset neutropenia is also well described when administered is conjunction with chemotherapy and appears to correlate with the intensity of the regimen. In addition, its ability to potentiate the mid-cycle chemotherapy related granulocytopenia has been observed in randomized clinical trials with CHOP and fludarabine based regimens, a finding that did not translate into increased infectious complications. In our study, the patients treated at dose level 5 developed grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in 8 of 11 cycles of therapy. The severe myelosuppression occurred more often and earlier in the treatment course compared to patients treated at the identical doses of fludarabine and bortezomib without rituximab. This potentiation of granulocytopenia may be related more to an undetermined interaction of rituximab with fludarabine than with bortezomib given the similar myelosuppression between dose levels 5a and 5b. However, it is possible that rituximab may have potentiated bortezomib-related thrombocytopenia, a common toxicity of the proteasome inhibitor that has not been otherwise observed with only fludarabine and rituximab. However, further investigation to validate these observations is needed given the small numbers treated at each dose level. ',\n"," 'Hematologic toxicity also appeared related to prior therapy. Patients who had dose intensive treatment or a greater number of prior regimens containing cytotoxic agents appeared to have a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity. This was more pronounced at higher dose levels. As such, this regimen may not be ideal for patients with poor bone marrow reserve, such as those who have undergone previous stem cell transplantation. Neuropathy resulted in 11 dosing adjustments or delays and resulted in a DLT in one patient. All 3 episodes of grade 3 neuropathy occurred at dose levels where 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib was used. While the effects were reversible, this complication is predictable with the combination of fludarabine and bortezomib. Patients with pre-existing peripheral or autonomic neuropathy as well as those with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be monitored closely. However, treatment is feasible as the symptoms typically improve after therapy discontinuation consistent with previous observations. Despite the adverse effects, considerable efficacy was also demonstrated with fludarabine bortezomib and rituximab. Although the primary goal of a phase I study is not to determine efficacy, it is encouraging that 11 of 20 evaluable patients achieved a complete or partial remission. Durable responses were observed at a variety of dose levels and were observed even in the patients who did not receive rituximab, suggesting that bortezomib added significantly to the regimen. This effect was noted despite the previous use of fludarabine in 8 patients and anti-CD20 immunotherapy in 23 patients. Treatment options are limited for patients with chemotherapy or rituximab-refractory disease. Response rates between 61% and 74% have been observed with other salvage strategies including bendamustine and radioimmunoconjugates in treatment refractory patients. Further, response rates with other bortezomib containing chemotherapeutic regimens used to treat patients with relapsed indolent NHL are comparable. In our study, 5 of 12 patients who were refractory to their last treatment regimen attained an objective response. Further, 4 of 11 patients who attained an objective response were treated at dose levels not containing rituximab suggesting notable activity of the fludarabine bortezomib combination. With this encouraging efficacy, further study using this combination in patients with refractory disease is warranted. In conclusion, we found the toxicity of fludarabine, bortezomib and rituximab to be predictable and tolerable with the major DLT being neutropenia. Further, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia resulted in a significant number of treatment interruptions and delays. ',\n"," 'Given the observed myelosuppression, administration of this regimen at 4 week intervals with hematopoietic growth factor support is recommended for further study in the phase II setting. ',\n"," 'Patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) often have chemotherapy resistant disease resulting in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to learn if inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) would produce tumor responses. This was a phase II study of oral single-agent everolimus (10 mg/day) for relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies including CLL. Four of 22 patients with CLL (18%, 95% CI: 5-40%) achieved a partial remission to therapy. An unanticipated finding in this study was an increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients. The ALC increased a median of 4.8 fold (range, 1.9 - 25.1), and the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy decreased a median of 75.5% (range, 38 - 93) compared to baseline measurements. Everolimus has modest anti-tumor activity against CLL and can mobilize malignant cells from nodal masses into the peripheral circulation in a subset of CLL patients. Because CLL cells in lymphatic tissue and bone marrow can be more resistant to therapy than circulating CLL cells, the ability of everolimus to mobilize CLL cells into the circulation could be utilized in combination therapeutic regimens. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the US with an estimated incidence of 20,000 new diagnoses per year and a prevalence of over 100,000. There is now highly effective initial therapy for previously untreated, advanced stage CLL with response rates of over 90%, complete responses (CR) in more than 40% of patients, and median response durations in excess of 3 years. In contrast, outcome remains poor for patients with relapsed or treatment-refractory CLL. More effective therapies for this group of patients are needed. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is a multifunctional signal transduction kinase with a critical role in the signal transduction pathway linking growth stimuli with cell cycle progression. Rapamycin can inhibit cell growth and proliferation, induce apoptosis in some tumor cell lines, and inhibit tumor cell motility by impairing cell polarization and protrusion. Rapamycin has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro although the required concentration was higher than is achievable in vivo and the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain. There are now two rapamycin analogs, temsirolimus and everolimus, which are currently approved by the US FDA for relapsed renal cancer. ',\n"," 'Temsirolimus also has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Although a major pathogenic mechanism in development of CLL is defective apoptosis, recent research has shown that CLL is a dynamic malignancy with cellular turnover ranging between 0.1 and 1% per day. The CLL tumor burden has two distinct cellular populations, a proliferative compartment morphologically characterized by larger cells in the proliferation centers of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, and the kinetically inactive circulating cells. A targeted inhibitor of cell division such as everolimus could be effective in the treatment of CLL, especially in patients with relapsed/refractory disease who often have more rapid cellular turnover. This hypothesis is supported by data from in vitro studies that showed that rapamycin and everolimus induce cell cycle arrest in activated CLL cells without inducing apoptosis. In addition, proliferation of CLL cells requires stromal support mediated through cytokines and adhesion molecules (e.g. integrins) and many of these supportive signals are transmitted by the PI3K and Akt pathways involving mTOR. Thus, there is a sound biological rationale for testing everolimus as a treatment for CLL. We have recently completed a phase II clinical trial using everolimus to treat patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies that included 22 patients with CLL. In this paper we report the results of treatment of the CLL patients. The most striking finding was the increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and concomitant decrease in the lymph node size observed in 8 of these patients. This was a two-stage, phase II study conducted to assess response in previously treated patients with lymphoid malignancies after treatment with single-agent everolimus. The study was conducted through the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients with CLL were eligible for this trial if they met the CLL diagnostic criteria defined by the National Cancer Institute-Working Group Criteria of 1996 (NCI-WG 1996) or the criteria for the small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) variant defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), had previously received therapy for their lymphoid malignancy, and had relapsed or were refractory to their last treatment. The relapse was required to be biopsy proven within 6 months prior to enrollment. There was no limit on the number of prior therapies. ',\n"," 'prior therapies. Patients were required to be >=18 years old, and in addition to meeting diagnostic criteria, were also required to have pre-treatment measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with at least one lesion that had a single diameter of >2 cm, or an ALC >5 x109/L. Patients were to have a life expectancy of >= 3 months; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1 x 109/L; platelet count >= 75 x 109/L; hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL; serum creatinine <= 2x the upper limit of normal (UNL); serum bilirubin <= 2 UNL (if total bilirubin >2 then a direct bilirubin of <1.5 UNL was acceptable); AST <= 3 x ULN (<= 5 x ULN if liver involvement was present). Patients could not have known HIV infection. Patients were treated with 10 mg of everolimus by mouth in the fasting state every day and 4 weeks of treatment was considered one cycle. A complete blood count was performed weekly during the first cycle and then before each subsequent cycle. If the platelet count was >=40 x 109/L, the ANC >=1 x 109/L, and there were no grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0), the full dose of everolimus was prescribed for the next cycle. Patients who did not meet the retreatment criteria had treatment held until recovery followed by a stepwise dose modification to 5 mg daily, 5 mg every other day, and 5 mg every third day. Patients did not receive prophylactic white blood cell growth factors to maintain dosing but could receive them at physician discretion if neutropenia developed. Erythropoietin treatment for anemia was also permitted at physician discretion. Patients were restaged for tumor response after 2 and 6 cycles using the NCI-WG 1996 criteria for those with an ALC > 5 x 109/L and the International Workshop Criteria for patients who had never had an ALC > 5 x 109/L (SLL variant). The maximum decrease in the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy was determined from the sum of the products of the largest lymph nodes diameters on clinical examination of the largest cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes. Patients who had disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at any time went off study. ',\n"," 'Patients with stable disease after 6 cycles continued treatment at their physician\\'s discretion.\"] Patients who had a complete remission (CR) after cycle 6 were to receive 2 cycles past CR and then could discontinue everolimus and be observed or could continue on therapy at their physician\\'s discretion.\"] Patients with a partial remission (PR) after 6 cycles of therapy continued on treatment until progression if tolerated. This phase II study used a two-stage Simon design to assess the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies. Thirty-seven evaluable patients were required to test the null hypothesis that the true response rate for this regimen is at most 20% versus the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is 40% or greater. The study had 90% power, with a 9% type I error rate. A patient was considered evaluable for response if they were eligible and received treatment. The response rate was estimated by the number of responses divided by the number of evaluable patients. A 95% binomial confidence interval for the true response rate was calculated. This report is limited to the 22 CLL patients enrolled on the study because of the unique characteristics of the response of these patients to treatment with everolimus. Duration of response (DR) was defined for patients who achieved a response as the time from the date a response was first documented until the earliest date progression was documented. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined for all patients as the time from the date of registration until the date of progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of registration until the date of death due to any cause. The distributions of time to event endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and patients who were event-free were censored on the date of last follow-up. Adverse events were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Toxicity was defined as an adverse event classified as being possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Twenty two patients with CLL (10 with the SLL variant) were enrolled on this study between January 2006 and July 2008 (Table 1). All patients were eligible and evaluable for response. The median time from diagnosis of CLL to registration was 7 years (range, 2 - 22 years). ',\n"," 'Four patients (18%, 95% CI: 5-40%) achieved a PR to therapy at 1.8, 6.4, 9.1, and 14.1 months of treatment and maintained a response for 2.2, 11.0, 19.8, and 8.9+ months, respectively. Seventeen patients had disease progression, and 15 patients have died. Causes of death included disease progression (n = 11), infection possibly attributable to treatment as detailed below (n = 2), infection unrelated to treatment (n=1), and was unknown in 1 patient. The median follow-up for patients still alive was 17 months (range, 6 - 30), the median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 4.9 - 20.7) and the median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI: 2.3 - 8.3). An unanticipated and potentially important finding of this study was the increase in the ALC associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients (Figure 1). This lymphocyte mobilization was observed in 6 (66%) of the 9 patients with an ALC > 5 x 109/L at baseline and 2 (15%) of the 13 patients with an ALC <= 5 x 109/L at baseline. Among the 8 patients in whom this phenomenon was observed, all had measurable lymphadenopathy at baseline and in 6 (75%) at least one node was >= 5 cm in diameter. The ALC increased from a median baseline level of 7.1 x 109/L (range, 0.7 - 101.2) to 18.3 x 109/L (range, 1.2 - 415.3) at the first post-treatment ALC (median interval from start of therapy 29 days, range, 7 - 49)(Figure 2). Patients achieved a median of 76% (range, 38 - 93) decrease in clinically measurable node size compared to baseline. This was associated with a median 4.8 fold (range, 1.9 - 25.1) increase in the ALC compared to baseline (median, 38.4 x 109/L; range, 3.8 - 415.3) which occurred at a median interval of 43 days (range, 29 - 242) from the start of therapy. Of the 8 patients with lymphocyte mobilization, 2 achieved a clinical PR (both had SLL), 4 had clinically stable disease, 1 had disease progression, and 1 was removed from the study because of an adverse event before clinical response could be evaluated. Lymphocyte mobilization was not an anticipated finding in this study and the mechanism of this response was not studied. ',\n"," 'In one patient with lymphocyte mobilization a bone marrow (BM) examination was performed on day 6 of everolimus treatment due to concern about the patient\\'s clinical status.\"] Although the results of the BM biopsy showed minimal change compared to baseline, the majority of the BM and circulating lymphocytes had the same morphological appearance of CLL cells. This finding suggests that the increase in circulating lymphocytes was caused by an increase in CLL cells. No confirmatory immunophenotyping studies were done on the circulating lymphocytes. Patients received a median of 2 months (range, 1 week - 29 months) and a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-18) of treatment. Twenty patients have gone off treatment, 13 due to disease progression, 3 due to toxicity (1 patient with grade 2 pancreatitis, 1 patient with grade 3 fatigue, 1 cytopenia), 2 died on-study (1 patient due to sepsis possibly related to treatment, 1 patient died from disease progression), and 2 patients refused further therapy without response or progression. Nine patients experienced dose delays on 12 cycles of therapy due to hematological adverse events (10 cycles), hospitalization (1 cycle), and a delay in getting laboratory results (1 cycle). Nine patients experienced dose reductions on 11 cycles due to hematological adverse events (9 cycles), mucositis (1 cycle), and infection (1 cycle). Fifteen patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse event (7 grade 3, 8 grade 4) and 9 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse event (5 grade 3, 1 grade 4, 3 grade 5). Focusing on adverse events at least possibly attributable to the study therapy (Table 2), 14 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity (6 grade 3, 8 grade 4) and 7 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (5 grade 3, 2 grade 5). Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 23%, 32%, and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities were pneumonia (n = 2) and hypertriglyceridemia (n = 2). One patient, who died of infection with positive blood cultures, had grade 4 adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicating sepsis and grade 3 neutropenia, both complications were considered to be probably related to treatment. Another patient with grade 2 neutropenia died of sepsis possibly related to treatment. Treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL using single agent everolimus showed biological activity with 18% of patients achieving a PR. ',\n"," 'An additional finding was that 36% of patients had an unexpected and marked increase in the ALC with a concomitant decease in lymph node size. These results show that everolimus can be clinically active in some patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, and suggest that mTOR inhibition can mobilize CLL cells from tissue sites into the circulation. Both of these findings could have important implications for the treatment of CLL. Patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, especially those with purine analogue refractory disease or loss of p53 function because of gene deletions or mutations, have a poor prognosis. The 18% PR rate achieved with everolimus therapy in this study, although modest, warrants further study in light of the heavily pretreated nature of the patient population, the fact that this study used single agent everolimus, and that tumor cell mobilization was observed. In addition, the modest response rate needs to be interpreted in the context of the NCI-WG 1996 criteria that requires a minimum 50% decrease in the ALC to qualify for a response to treatment. The increase in ALC observed in 6 of the patients with CLL who had a decrease in adenopathy, prevents them from being considered responsive to treatment. This could have resulted in an underestimation of the efficacy of single agent everolimus therapy in this group of patients. The mobilization effect observed could be especially useful for selecting drugs to be tested in combination with everolimus. In the only previously published report of the treatment of patients with CLL using everolimus, the pilot trial was stopped after treatment of only 7 patients because of infectious complications. Of the treated patients, one achieved a PR and 3 had stable disease. Although not commented on by the authors, review of the published data shows that 6 of the 7 patients appear to have had progressive lymphocytosis in response to initiation of therapy with everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/day; there was no information on the effect of everolimus on lymphadenopathy. The stromal microenvironment of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow provides critical support for CLL cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to therapeutic drugs. Pre-clinical data suggests that disruption of the interaction between CLL cells and stroma can decrease drug resistance in CLL cells. In addition, the therapeutic unconjugated monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab and rituximab, which are highly effective against circulating CLL cells, have limited efficacy against bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly. ',\n"," 'Mobilization of CLL cells from tissue into the circulation is likely to remove these CLL cells from the protective stromal microenvironment and enhance the cytotoxicity of drugs such as alemtuzumab which have the additional advantage of being effective in patients with purine analogue refractory CLL with defective p53 function. Combinations of everolimus and drugs such as alemtuzumab could potentially be synergistic in patients with bulky adenopathy resulting in improved treatment outcomes. Everolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that can also be myelosuppressive. Thus, it was not surprising that infections were observed in this study of CLL patients already immunocompromised by their underlying disease and prior therapy. Indeed, infection resulted in 2 deaths. Neutropenia could have contributed to the risk of infection, but thrombocytopenia was not associated with bleeding complications. The other grade 3-4 toxicities responded well to appropriate management. These data suggest that CLL patients treated with everolimus in the future will likely benefit from prophylaxis and surveillance for opportunistic infections, and that combination therapies including everolimus should be designed to minimize marrow toxicity in this patient population. The mTOR has been shown to be an integral component of important signaling pathways in CLL cells, and inhibition of these pathways by everolimus could be expected to decrease cell growth and be cytotoxic. In contrast, the mechanism by which everolimus causes CLL cell mobilization into the circulation is unknown and will need to be investigated in order to develop interventions to optimize this effect. These investigations were not performed in this study because the finding was unexpected. The extent of mobilization and the concomitant decrease in the clinically detectable lymphadenopathy was only fully appreciated at the time of analysis of the study results. The study was designed to evaluate ALC each cycle and measurable lymph nodes after cycles two and six and every three cycles thereafter. The study was not designed to measure or record ALC more frequently; therefore, the kinetics and magnitude of the CLL cell mobilization could actually have been underestimated in this study population. Future studies should be designed to more frequently measure the mobilization effect of everolimus in CLL patients, study the cell surface immunophenotype of the mobilized cells, and determine if the CLL cells mobilized into the circulation are as sensitive to monoclonal antibody mediated cytotoxicity as cells collected prior to treatment with everolimus. ',\n"," 'In conclusion, this study shows that everolimus could be a valuable drug for use in combination therapy for CLL patients. ',\n"," 'INNO-406, an oral dual Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), demonstrates specific Lyn kinase activity with no or limited activity against other Src-family member kinases. Several Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including the F317L and F317V mutations. In this study, we evaluated INNO-406 in Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) post-imatinib resistance or intolerance. A dose escalation study was conducted with a starting dose of 30mg administered orally once daily. Cohorts of at least 3 patients were treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Twice-daily (BID) dosing was also evaluated. Therapy was allowed for a maximum of 24 months. INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with imatinib resistance (n=40) or intolerance (n=16). Other previous treatments included nilotinib (n=20), dasatinib (n=26), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n=9). Common mutations upon study entry included Y253H (n=6), G250E (n=4), T315I (n=4) and F317L (n=3). Among 31 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with INNO-406, the major cytogenetic response rate was 19%. In this study, no responses were seen in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at INNO-406 480mg BID were liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. INNO-406 showed anti-CML efficacy in this heavily pretreated study population. Based on the classical determinations of both DLT and MTD, the recommended phase 2 dose of INNO-406 is 240mg orally BID. Lower doses of INNO-406 may be equally effective and should be explored. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which >=95% of patients display a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome abnormality yields a fusion gene encoding a constitutively active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase that is considered essential for the pathophysiology of CML. In the United States, about 5000 people are diagnosed with CML each year. Historically, the 5-year survival rate for patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) was approximately 40%. Since the introduction in 2001 of the first specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib mesylate, the estimated 5 to 7-year survival rates for newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have increased to over 90%. As patients with CML live longer, prevalence of the disease is expected to increase over the coming years. The success of imatinib demonstrates that specific inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase has clinical benefits in the treatment of CML. ',\n"," 'However, based on the findings of a 5-year follow up assessment, imatinib resistance occurs at a rate of approximately 4% per year. Resistance is believed to be due to 3 main mechanisms: (1) increased expression of Bcr-Abl; (2) Bcr-Abl mutations; and (3) the development of Bcr-Abl-independent resistance pathways, such as Lyn kinase activation. In patients with Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or those with CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP) or blastic phase (CML-BP), imatinib treatment often fails to achieve high rates of complete cytogenetic response; these patients frequently develop resistance to therapy and relapse. In 20% to 55% of such patients, treatment resistance can be attributed to the emergence of clones with mutant forms of Bcr-Abl, which exhibit a decreased sensitivity to imatinib. More than 60 mutant forms of Bcr-Abl have been detected, the most common of which are E255K, T315I, and M351T. Mutants have varying degrees of imatinib resistance, and thus more potent Bcr-Abl inhibitors or dual Abl/Lyn inhibitors may improve treatment results. INNO-406, a dual Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may be an effective treatment for certain leukemias (Ph-positive CML and ALL). INNO-406, was developed to overcome imatinib resistance. Unlike other second-generation TKIs, INNO-406 demonstrates specific Lyn kinase activity with no or limited activity against other Src-family member kinases. Numerous Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including the F317L and F317V mutations. INNO-406 is 25 to 55 times more potent than imatinib against Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cell lines K562 and KU812 and against BaF3 cells overexpressing unmutated Bcr-Abl (BaF3/um). Autophosphorylation of unmutated Bcr-Abl is also more potently inhibited by INNO-406 than by imatinib. In vivo, INNO-406 is at least 10 times more potent than imatinib. Chemically, INNO-406 is a 2-phenlaminopyrimidine with structural resemblance to both imatinib and nilotinib. The molecular structure of INNO-406 is shown in Figure 1. This phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized dose-escalation study was conducted at 6 international sites from July 17, 2006, to November 28, 2007, to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical activity of INNO-406 administered orally daily in adult patients with Ph-positive CML or ALL post-imatinib resistance or intolerance. Patients with Ph-positive leukemias, including CML-CP, CML-AP, CML-BP, and Ph-positive ALL), and imatinib resistance or intolerance were included in the trial. The definitions of imatinib resistance and intolerance were as previously described. ',\n"," 'greater than or equal to 15,000 cells/mm3, documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 2 week) or cytogenetic (greater than 35% of Ph-positive cells in the bone marrow after at least 1 year of therapy, or an absolute rise in the percentage of Ph-positive cells of 30% over best response). Imatinib intolerance was defined as the presence of any toxicity that prevented patients from receiving therapy (according to the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 [CTCAE v3.0] grade 3 or 4 toxicity or persistent grade 2 toxicity). Patients with resistance or intolerance to other second-line TKIs, such as dasatinib or nilotinib, were also included. Definitions of CML phases were as previously reported. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be 18 years of age or older, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2, and have normal cardiac, hepatic, and renal functions. Females enrolled in the study could not be pregnant or lactating. Patients were not allowed to have received chemotherapy within 1 week or imatinib within 3 days before the start of the trial. Exceptions included hydroxyurea administration, as clinically indicated before and during the first 21 days of treatment, and corticosteroids up to 48 hours before the first study dose. Patients with comorbid states, such as opportunistic and/or uncontrolled systemic infections, impaired gastrointestinal function, psychiatric disorders, and/or sustained toxicity from prior therapies, were excluded from the study, as were those with a history of another primary malignancy of clinical significance requiring intervention. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at each study site. Patients were required to provide written informed consent. The primary objective of this phase 1 study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of INNO-406. Secondary objectives included evaluation of response, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The starting dose of INNO-406 was 30 mg administered orally once daily (QD), equaling 10% of the 30 mg/kg dose level used in a previous 4-week rat toxicity study, at which no deaths occurred (data on file). In the absence of a CTCAE v3.0 grade 2 or higher drug-related toxicity, the dose of INNO-406 was escalated by 100% in cohorts of at least 3 patients. If grade 2 drug-related toxicity occurred, INNO-406 dose was increased by 50% until the MTD was reached. ',\n"," 'The INNO-406 doses evaluated were: 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 mg QD, and then 120, 240, and 480 mg administered orally twice daily (BID). Because all of the patients in the 480 mg BID cohort experienced toxicities, a BID cohort between the 240 mg and 480 mg BID cohorts was evaluated; this intermediate cohort received 360 mg BID. Once the MTD was determined, up to 20 patients in each of the 3 CML phases and up to 20 patients with Ph-positive ALL were treated at that dose. Intrapatient dose escalation of INNO-406 was permitted in patients who had a suboptimal response to INNO-406 therapy only after the next dose level had been documented to be safe. A suboptimal response was defined as a failure to achieve either a hematologic response after 1 month or a major cytogenetic response after 6 months of therapy. This is based on observations that failure to achieve early hematologic response or major cytogenetic response after 6-12 months are associated with worse outcome. At each step, the investigators evaluated the relevant risks and benefits of continued study participation for each patient. No more than 2 dose reductions were allowed before the patient was withdrawn from the study, unless this was considered in the patient\\'s best interest.\"] Patients were removed from therapy or further assessment upon disease progression, physician decision that a change in therapy was in the patient\\'s best interest, or by patient\\'s request.\"] Other reasons for removal of patients from the study were continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal dose reduction, noncompliance, and pregnancy. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v3.0 criteria. Disease response was assessed at specified intervals by disease-specific response criteria. Response criteria were as previously described. A complete hematologic response (CHR) was defined as normal white blood cell count (WBC) with normal differential and platelet counts <450x109/L, and no signs or symptoms of leukemia, including no splenomegaly. Cytogenetic response was defined as complete (0% Ph-positive), partial (1-35% Ph-positive), and minor (36-95% Ph-positive). A major cytogenetic response included complete and partial cytogenetic responses (i.e., <= 35% Ph-positive). The incidence, severity, duration, causality, seriousness, and type of adverse events, physical examination changes, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results were recorded and tabulated. Standard pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined, together with the coefficient of variation of INNO-406 concentrations, to guide decision-making with regard to dosing level and frequency. ',\n"," 'Patients were evaluated for both complete and partial hematologic and cytogenetic responses. Mutational analyses were performed as previously detailed. INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with Ph-positive CML or ALL and resistance to (n = 40 [71%]) or intolerance of (n = 16 [29%]) imatinib (Table 1). Twenty-seven patients (48%) were females. In addition to imatinib, most of the patients had been treated previously with other TKIs, including dasatinib (n = 26), nilotinib (n = 20), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n = 9). Forty-six patients had failed at least two TKIs (imatinib and dasatinib or nilotinib); nine of the 46 patients had failed all three TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib); 10 of the 56 patients failed only imatinib. Fourteen patients (25%) were resistant to and 12 (21%) were intolerant of dasatinib. Seventeen (30%) patients were nilotinib resistant and 3 (5%) patients were nilotinib intolerant. The median duration of CML was 84 months (range, 43 to 267 months). Median durations of INNO-406 treatment were 3.7 months (range, 1 to 12 months) for the overall study group and 4.4 months (range, 1 to 12 months) for the subgroup with CML-CP. All 17 patients enrolled at 240 mg BID after determination of the MTD had CML-CP. INNO-406 was well tolerated, and QD dosing cohorts of 30 to 480 mg QD were treated without the development of DLTs. After pharmacokinetic analyses suggested that BID dosing might be beneficial, BID dosing cohorts were initiated, beginning with 120 mg BID. At a dose level of 480 mg BID, DLTs, including elevations of transaminases and thrombocytopenia, were observed. Transaminase elevations were still noted at an INNO-406 dose of 360 mg BID; these included grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in 4 patients and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations in 2 patients. Seventeen patients were then enrolled at 240 mg BID as part of a protocol-specified expansion cohort, which was limited to patients with CML-CP. In the 17 patients treated with 240 mg BID, transaminase elevations were still observed but were less severe. No patients had drug-related grade 3 AST elevations and only 1 patient had a drug-related grade 3 ALT elevation. Drug related grade 2 ALT elevations occurred at the 240 mg BID dose level in 9 patients, and a grade 2 AST elevation developed in 1 patient. ',\n"," 'The elevated transaminase levels observed at 240 mg BID resolved when INNO-406 dosing was withheld temporarily and then resumed at a lower dose. Based on these results, an INNO-406 dose of 240 mg BID is proposed for phase 2 studies. In addition to elevated transaminases, the other most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse event noted was thrombocytopenia (Table 2). When both drug- and non-drug-related thrombocytopenic events were considered, 2 and 3 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia, respectively, including 1 patient who initiated INNO-406 treatment with preexisting grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts recovered when INNO-406 was withheld and then resumed at a lower dose. This study incorporated a planned central evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the first cycle of therapy to assess for QT prolongation. During this period of intense monitoring, the QTcB increased to grade 2 in 4 patients and the QTcF increased to grade 2 in 1 patient. Only 1 patient, who entered the study with a waiver due to a prolonged QTc, developed a QTc >500 msec during this routine monitoring after cycle 1. The patient experienced no further events after discontinuing INNO-406. The NCI categories of adverse events that were experienced by >=10% of patients were metabolic/laboratory (73.2%), gastrointestinal (64.3%), pain (58.9%), constitutional symptoms (48.2%), infection (33.9%), dermatology/skin (28.6%), blood/bone marrow (25.0%), lymphatics (25.0%), neurology (23.2%), pulmonary/upper respiratory (17.9%), cardiac general (12.5%), hemorrhage/bleeding (10.7%), and musculoskeletal/soft tissue (10.7%). Five patients have died since beginning treatment; all deaths were related to leukemia progression. Four deaths were among 16 patients in CML blastic phase or Ph-positive ALL; 1 death was among 8 patients in CML accelerated phase; no deaths so far have been recorded among 31 patients in chronic phase. The 5 deaths did not appear to be correlated to dosing regimen: 1 at 30 mg daily, 2 at 120 mg daily, 1 at 480 mg BID, 1 at 360 mg BID. No cases of pleural or pericardial effusions were noted. Table 3 provides a detailed summary of cytogenetic responses. All of the patients who achieved a cytogenetic response had CML-CP. No responses were observed in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with CML-CP. Three patients had a complete cytogenetic response, one at each of the INNO-406 dose schedules of 120 mg QD, 120 mg BID, and 240 mg BID. ',\n"," 'The remaining 3 patients had a partial cytogenetic response: 2 patients at 240 mg BID and 1 patient at 480 mg BID. None of the six major cytogenetic responders had baseline cytogenetic clonal evolution. Thus, 4 of the major cytogenetic responses occurred in patients treated with INNO-406 doses of 240 mg BID or greater. This represents a major cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled, and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CML-CP. For the patients with major cytogenetic responses, the pretreatment regimens and the associated reasons for changes in therapy are listed in Table 4, which also provides the mutation status at baseline (eg, prior to INNO-406 exposure). Two additional patients achieved a minimal cytogenetic response. Complete and partial hematologic responses were observed in 3 patients. Illustrative of the pharmacokinetic data seen in the full analyses, the pharmacokinetic parameters of INNO-406 in the 240 mg BID cohort are presented here. This cohort was selected based on clinical safety and efficacy evaluations that took events at the higher doses into consideration. As illustrated in Figure 2, accumulation of INNO-406 was observed on day 15 for both the 360 and 480 mg BID cohorts. For the 240 mg BID cohort, the mean time to achieve peak concentration (Cmax = 487 ng/mL) was 1.3 hours (standard deviation [SD] = 0.5). Pharmacokinetic analyses performed in the entire study population also demonstrated an increase in Cmax with increasing INNO-406 doses for both QD and BID dosing. The half-life was relatively short; mean (SD) half-lives for BID dosing on day 1 and day 15 were 1.99 hours (0.817) and 2.28 hours (0.751), respectively. For BID dosing, the mean (SD) accumulation factor was 2.73 (4.96). The maximum concentration and area under the curve (Cmax and AUC) were dose proportional; however, dose proportionality for AUC was not demonstrable with BID dosing. Mutational analysis performed at the central laboratories revealed mutations in 22 of 49 patients (45%) analyzed. Common mutations included Y253H in 6 patients, G250E in 4 patients, T315I in 4 patients, and F317L in 3 patients. This phase 1 study of INNO-406, a novel, potent dual BCR-AbL/Lyn TKI, evaluated dose levels ranging from once-daily doses of 30 to 480 mg and from BID doses of 120 to 480 mg. The DLTs observed included liver dysfunction and myelosuppression. ',\n"," 'The proposed INNO 406 dose scheduled for phase 2 study is 240 mg orally BID, and this value is based on the classical determinations of DLT and MTD from phase I studies. Lower dose schedules of INNO-406 may be as effective and should be explored. In this heavily pretreated study group of 56 patients, INNO-406 therapy resulted in 6 major cytogenetic responses (3 complete and 3 partial), all in 31 patients treated for CML-CP, for a major cytogenetic response rate of 19%. Of the 56 patients treated in this study, 71% were resistant to and 29% were intolerant of imatinib. In addition, 26 patients experienced resistance to or intolerance of dasatinib, and 20 patients, resistance to or intolerance of nilotinib. In the majority of patients, therefore, prior treatment with multiple Bcr-Abl TKIs had failed. As many of the patients in this study were being treated in the third-line setting, a lower response rate would be expected than seen in the second-line setting represented by the dasatinib and nilotinib studies. In this study, no responses were seen in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with CML-CP. Four of the responses occurred in patients in the cohort that received a starting INNO-406 dose of 240 mg BID or greater. This represents a major cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CML-CP. Major cytogenetic responses have been reported in 40% to 45% of patients with CML-CP treated in the second-line setting with dasatinib or nilotinib. It is unclear what response would be expected with dasatinib or nilotinib in a study population that included both second- and third-line setting patients. Myelosuppression and pleural effusions are serious adverse events that have been seen with dasatinib, and myelosuppression and liver dysfunction, with nilotinib., 25 These events were observed infrequently with INNO-406. The safety profile of INNO-406 is therefore unique, offering a potential advantage in the treatment of patients who have developed toxicities during treatment with other Bcr-Abl TKIs. Of note, a planned central evaluation of ECGs during the first cycle of INNO-406 therapy revealed only 1 patient with a QTc >500 msec; this patient, who had an elevated QTc at baseline, entered the study with a waiver. ',\n"," 'Mutational analysis revealed mutations prior to the start of INNO-406 in 22 of the 49 patients analyzed (45%). Among these were 4 patients who had T315I mutations, which are known to confer resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. None of the 4 patients with T315I mutations responded to INNO-406. Outcomes of CML treatment have improved dramatically since the introduction of imatinib mesylate. The rising incidence of imatinib resistance and intolerance has resulted in the need for alternative agents. Nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are second-generation TKIs that have been developed to overcome imatinib resistance. All 3 agents have similar efficacy with slightly different adverse effect profiles. There is a need for additional agents that are more potent than both imatinib and the existing second-generation TKIs. As patients are being treated longer, they are more commonly cycling through different treatment regimens. This study demonstrates that INNO-406 is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg BID. Lower dose schedules may also be equally effective and deserve further evaluation. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of INNO-406 in patients who have developed resistance to or intolerance of imatinib and/or other TKIs. INNO-406, an oral dual Abl/Lyn kinase inhibitor, is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg BID in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. ',\n"," 'Fludarabine, is one of the most active single agents in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Over time, however, virtually all CLL patients become fludarabine-refractory. To elucidate whether microRNAs are involved in the development of fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the expression of 723 human miRNAs before and 5-days after fludarabine mono-therapy in 17 CLL patients which were classified as responder or refractory to fludarabine treatment based on NCI criteria. By comparing the expression profiles of these two groups of patients, we identified a microRNA signature able to distinguish refractory from sensitive CLLs. The expression of some microRNAs was also able to predict fludarabine resistance of 12 independent CLL patients. Among the identified microRNAs, miR-148a, miR-222 and miR-21 exhibited a significantly higher expression in non-responder patients either before and after fludarabine treatment. After performing messenger RNA expression profile of the same patients, the activation of p53-responsive genes was detected in fludarabine responsive cases only, therefore suggesting a possible mechanism linked to microRNA deregulation in non-responder patients. Importantly, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides induced a significant increase in caspase activity in fludarabine-treated p53-mutant MEG-01 cells, suggesting that miR-21 and miR-222 up-regulation may be involved in the establishment of fludarabine resistance. This is the first report that reveals the existence of a microRNA profile that differentiate refractory and sensitive CLLs, either before and after fludarabine mono-therapy. A p53 dysfunctional pathway emerged in refractory CLLs and could contribute in explaining the observed miRNA profile. Moreover, this work indicates that specific microRNAs can be used to predict fludarabine resistance and may potentially be used as therapeutic targets, therefore establishing an important starting point for future studies. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common hematologic neoplasia in the Western world and is characterized by a clonal expansion of CD5+ B-cells. The disease may have a long and indolent course, not requiring treatment for years, or it may rapidly progress. Initially most patients respond to purine nucleoside analogs, which today represent pivotal agents for first and second-line treatment. However a significant fraction of patients do not respond or become resistant to fludarabine in the years and prognosis for this group of patients is poor. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. It has been reported that p53 dysfunction, deriving from 17p13 deletion, predicts non-response to fludarabine therapy and poor prognosis. ',\n"," 'Other genetic factors associated with poor prognosis, such as del(11q22.3) and immunoglobulin (Ig) V(H) unmutated status, have been also associated with shorter progression-free survival after chemotherapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes, through their wide action as post-transcriptional gene expression modulators. In CLL, miR-15/16 were shown to be located within 13q14 deletion; they were shown to act as tumor suppressor genes, possibly through the modulation of BCL2 and various other target genes. A germline mutation affecting miRNA maturation was detected in few cases of familial CLL as well as in the New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse strain, a mice developing a B lymphoproliferative disease that is a model for human CLL. A set of miRNAs was able to distinguish CLLs from normal CD5+ B-cells and 13 miRNAs associated to CLL prognostic groups were identified through the identification of the molecular profiles of CLLs with IgVH mutated or unmutated status combined with ZAP70 levels. Likewise, miR-29c and miR-223 have been used to create a quantitative PCR-based score able to improve CLL patients stratification in terms of treatment free survival and overall survival, when combined with two other prognostic factors. Recently, Zenz and colleagues found that fludarabine-refractory CLLs were characterized more frequently (53%) by lower levels of miR-34a than sensitive CLLs (9%). MiR-34a has been implicated in CLL response to DNA damage through a p53-mediated induction, while miR-106b has been linked to Itch inhibition, and consequent p73 activation, in deacetylase inhibitors treated CLLs. Fludarabine is an active agent in CLL and, it is frequently used nowadays in combination regimens in first and second line treatment, especially in younger and fit patients. Fludarabine as single agent produces better response rates than chlorambucil and represents a reasonable choice as single agent in frail or elderly patients. Because specific miRNAs may be involved in patients response to fludarabine treatment and in the development of fludarabine resistance, we designed this study aimed at identifying the miRNA expression profile associated with the response to fludarabine, used as a single agent, in the treatment of patients with CLL. To investigate the possible involvement of miRNAs in fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the miRNA expression profile of 17 CLL patients, before and after 5 days of treatment with fludarabine as single agent. ',\n"," 'NCI criteria, 9 of the patients exhibited a clinical response (CR), i.e. they attained either complete or partial response, while 8 patients were resistant to the treatment and were classified as non responders (NR). Characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table 1. An additional blind cohort of 12 patients was recruited among patients who were treated with fludarabine (Table 1), to test the efficacy of specific miRNAs as response predictors. We evaluated the miRNAs expression in 33 samples obtained from CLL patients before and after treatment, hereafter called pre and post, through the hybridization on a miRNA platform (Agilent technologies) able to assess the expression levels of 723 human miRNAs (MiRBASE release 10.1). First, we identified the miRNAs induced or repressed by fludarabine treatment by comparing post CLLs to the pre-treatment samples (fold change >1.5 and p-value < 0.05). We compared pre and post samples in the entire groups or in the NR and CR sub-groups separately, which revealed 97, 67 and 60 differentially expressed miRNAs, respectively. Among these, using Venn Diagram intersection, we identified 37 miRNAs that were differentially expressed either in the CR cohort and in the NR cohort of samples (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). A hierarchical clustering algorithm, performed using the list of 37 miRNAs, correctly classified the pre versus post fludarabine samples (Figure 1). The complete list of miRNAs that were identified as differentially expressed either in the CR cohort or in the NR cohort of samples or both can be found in Additional file 2: Table S2. The post versus pre treatment analysis revealed that 37 miRNAs were similarly modulated by fludarabine in both NR and CR patients. This set of miRNAs indicated common mechanisms modulated by fludarabine, but could not reveal mechanisms underlying resistance to treatment. However, many additional miRNAs exhibited a different modulation in CRs versus NRs, which could be used to derive a miRNA signature associated with fludarabine resistance. To investigate this hypothesis, we searched for miRNAs whose expression was significantly different between these two cohorts of CLL patients. Analyses of pre and post treatment samples were performed separately. The lists of differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained by statistical analysis of microarray data (Table 2 and 3). ',\n"," 'The comparison of CR and NR patients led to the identification of 10 differentially expressed miRNAs in the pre-treatment setting (p < 0.05), listed in Table 2. This set of miRNAs was used to classify the patients by a clusterization algorithm. Eighty-two percent of patients were correctly classified by a cluster analysis (all but three: CLL 11, 18 and 22) (Figure 2A). The comparison of CRs and NRs in the post-treatment setting led to the identification of 11 miRNAs differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive patients (p < 0.05) (Table 3). Cluster analysis of these miRNAs was able to correctly classify 88% samples (all but two: CLL 4 and 22) (Figure 2B). We validated the microarray results for miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) on the same group of 16 post samples, adding also 3 new samples. We chose these miRNAs considering the extent of their modulation and because they are differentially expressed both before and after the treatment. The expression level of every miRNA in every post CLL was assayed in triplicate and normalized on U6 RNA expression levels. Microarray results were confirmed by RT-qPCR in every group of CLLs (Additional file 3: Figure S1). To verify whether the three validated miRNAs (miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222) might be able to predict the efficacy of fludarabine treatment and might therefore become useful in directing patients therapy, we collected a new cohort of 12 patients (test set). These patients were treated by fludarabine as single agent because of disease progression. Samples were collected immediately before the treatment and the miRNA expression was assayed by RT-qPCR. In this new cohort, results were even more clear than in the microarray training set of samples (Figure 3A). Patients classified as NRs displayed a significantly (p < 0.05 at two-tailed t-test) increased expression of miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222 if compared to patients sensitive to treatment. Interestingly, we were also able to predict the response to treatment of newly diagnosed patients by using a score based on the combination of miR-21, 148a and 222 expression levels. Using this score based on quantitative expression of 3 miRNAs, prediction was 100% accurate (Figure 3B). To better elucidate the molecular context responsible for the differential expression of miRNAs in NR versus CR patients, we performed a mRNA expression profile on a subgroup of the samples. ',\n"," 'Experiments data were obtained for pre and post fludarabine treatment of 14 patients (the same employed for miRNA analysis, except CLL-04, CLL-09 and CLL-16A, whose RNA was not available), 7 of them were CRs and 7 NRs. We hybridized the samples on a human mRNA platform (Agilent Technologies) able to assess the expression levels 41,000 human transcripts. We performed an analysis aimed at identifying the genes induced or repressed by the pharmacologic treatment, with a particular interest in genes modulated only in CRs or NRs. To this end, we normalized the expression of every gene in each post sample to the expression of the same gene in the matched pre sample. We identified the mRNAs that exhibited a significant differential modulation (p-value < 0.05) after fludarabine treatment, separately analyzing refractory and sensitive CLLs (data not shown). Then, we identified the most significant pathways modulated by fludarabine through a Pathway Enrichment analysis of the two gene lists. Interestingly, the p53 pathway emerged as the most significantly induced pathway in the cohort of CR patients (Table 4). For example, G1/S and G2/M DNA damage checkpoints, p53 stabilization and p53-dependent response, BH3-only proteins pathways were all significantly enriched in the CR cohort of CLL patients. Conversely, the same pathways were not enriched or were less significant in NR patients, indicating that NR CLLs had a dysfunctional p53 pathway. A pathway representative of p53 cell cycle control was generated, coloring the genes with the expression levels in CR and NR groups (Figure 4A), while the average expression level of all the genes involved in p53 pathway is graphically represented in Figure 4B. The above results suggest that an abnormal miRNA expression may be involved in the generation of fludarabine resistance. Among the various miRNAs differentially expressed between NR versus CR patients, miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a emerged as significantly up-regulated in two different cohorts of refractory patients, both before and after fludarabine administration. MiR-21 has a well-established role in protection from apoptosis and drug-response modulation and miR-222 is an important cell cycle regulator through its action on p27. We therefore investigated whether their inhibition could improve fludarabine cell death activity in the human MEG-01 cell model. We employed the MEG-01 cell line because it carries a 13q14 deletion affecting miR-15a/miR-16-1, typical of CLL, and a mutant TP53 gene. ',\n"," 'MiR-16 is indeed down-regulated (fold-change 2.3, p = 0.07) in pre-treatment fludarabine-refractory CLLs, and, as above indicated, NRs are defective in the p53 pathway. These cells may therefore mimic features which are responsible for resistance to fludarabine. We hypothesized that anti-miR-21, 148a and 222 could be implicated in fludarabine-induced apoptotic process. We therefore assayed the MEG-01 cells for Caspase 3/7 activation (Caspase 3/7 Glo assay, Promega); MEG-01 cells were treated for 24 hours with LNA anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-222 or anti-miR-148a followed by addition of fludarabine for additional 24 hours. A significant (p < 0.01) increase of caspase 3/7 activity was detected for miR-21 and miR-222 (Figure 5A, B) while no difference was observed for miR-148a (Figure 5C). We hereby concluded that the high miR-21 and miR-222 levels may be responsible for a weaker apoptotic effect of fludarabine in refractory patients, while the mechanism of action of miR-148a remains to be established. We analyzed the expression profile of 29 CLL patients who were treated by fludarabine, a pivotal drug in the modern treatment of CLL. To better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of fludarabine resistance, we investigated the miRNA expression alterations of patients who received fludarabine as single agent, thus avoiding the potentially confounding elements that are inevitably present when fludarabine is used in combination with other drugs. Moreover, samples were obtained before and after first fludarabine treatment from the same patient, making it possible to directly evaluate the effect of the drug in vivo. Our results revealed that many miRNAs are modulated by fludarabine treatment, as shown by the 37 miRNAs that are modulated following the treatment in both CR and NR patients, while 23 and 30 miRNAs were differentially modulated only in CRs or NRs, respectively, suggesting that these two cohorts of patients show signs of differences in the execution of molecular pathways modulated by fludarabine. Indeed, in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these miRNAs, we analyzed the molecular pathways modulated by fludarabine in sensitive and refractory CLLs that emerged by mRNA expression analysis. The discovery that many p53 pathway genes (i.e. ',\n"," 'CDKN1A, BBC3/PUMA, PCNA, GADD45A) were activated in CRs but not in NRs provides further support to the notion that fludarabine treatment of patients with CLL induces a p53-dependent gene expression response and that a defective p53 pathway in refractory CLLs, due to 17p deletions, p53 mutations and other p53-linked dysfunctions, is associated with fludarabine resistance. It is therefore possible that the differential expression of miRNAs between CR versus NR patients may be affected by a defective p53 pathway. Interestingly, it has been reported that miR-221/222 cluster is repressed by p53, implicating that a non-functional p53 pathway may lead to its up-regulation, as detected in NR patients. An example of an aberrantly expressed miRNA influenced by p53 in fludarabine-refractory CLL has been recently reported by Zenz and colleagues, who observed a higher frequency of fludarabine refractory CLLs in the group of low-expressing miR-34a, than in similar patients with high expression of this miRNA. MiR-34a was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of p53. Although we did not find a significant differential expression level of miR-34a in NR compared with CR CLLs, our data concur with those of Zenz et al., in fact 3 patients with the 17p deletion involved in this study displayed no miR-34a expression (data not shown). By comparing the miRNA expression profile of sensitive and refractory CLLs, we have been able to identify expression signatures that could correctly classify more than 80% of the CR vs NR cases, either before or after treatment. Interestingly, after validation by quantitative PCR of the most significant miRNAs (miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a) in an independent population, the prediction of response to therapy for pre-therapy samples was impressive: a predictive score based on miRNA expression levels reached an overall accuracy of 100%. This information may have important clinical implications because it might spare subsequent treatment in patients identified as resistant during disease progression. MiRNAs aberrant expression may not only represent a phenomenon able to reveal an underlying molecular defect, such as p53 dysfunction, but it may also represent one of the possible mechanisms responsible for fludarabine resistance. In this study, we found that some miRNAs, namely miR-222, miR-148a and miR-21 were differentially expressed between NR and CR CLLs both before and after fludarabine treatment and were all up-regulated in the NR group. These findings, not previously described in CLL, appears to be truly significant. ',\n"," 'Indeed, miR-222 can target the cell growth suppressive cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p57 and the c-KIT receptor (source: Tarbase) thus promoting cell cycle progression. Among the recently validated targets there are the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BMF, the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which are both involved in tongue carcinoma metastasis promotion and whose expression is frequently altered in cancer. An higher expression of miR-222 has been associated with poor survival in pancreatic cancer and the enforced expression of miR-221/222 improved the growth of prostate carcinoma xenografts in mice. Moreover, anti-sense inhibition of miR-221 could increase susceptibility to gemcitabine. MiR-21 up-regulation appears to be an important mechanism of malignant transformation, since it was found up-regulated in several types of neoplasia (see Spizzo et al. for a list); it accounts, among the known validated targets, numerous tumors suppressor genes, such as TPM1, PDCD4, maspin (SERPINB3) and PTEN (source: Tarbase). New interesting targets of miR-21 were recently identified through the validation of proteomic results. It was also correlated with poor prognosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma, colon, breast and pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, the use of the anti-miR-21 AMOs increases susceptibility of colangiocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine and elicit a pro-apoptotic response in glioblastoma and breast cancer cells. Here, we report that inhibition of miR-222 and miR-21 in the MEG-01 human cells using an anti-miRNA oligonucleotide increases susceptibility to fludarabine, as shown by the significant increase in caspase activity. Our findings suggest a direct role of miR-222 and miR-21 in conferring resistance to fludarabine chemotherapy independently from the p53 pathway, which is dysfunctional in this human cell line. Less clear is the role of miR-148a. MiR-148a is up-regulated in NR CLL patients either before and after fludarabine treatment and it was identified also as resistance predictor in pre CLLs. However, its mechanism of action is not clear, as only two gene targets are presently experimentally validated. One is the isoform 1 of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b1) and the other is the pregnane X receptor gene whose repression, in turn, reduces the expression of CYP3A4 enzyme. Our assay revealed that its mechanism of action may not be linked to apoptosis inhibition in resistant patients. Therefore, its role in fludarabine resistance remains unknown. ',\n"," 'This study revealed that a characteristic miRNA expression profile, as assessed before and soon after start of treatment, can discriminate between fludarabine sensitive and fludarabine resistant CLLs. We confirm the importance of a defective p53 pathway in conferring fludarabine resistance. This mechanism may be relevant in affecting miRNA expression; however, we suggest that an aberrant miRNA expression, i.e. up-regulation of miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222 in NRs, may be important in establishing resistance independently from p53, protecting cells from apoptosis. Indeed, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 may increase sensitivity to fludarabine in vitro in a p53-mutant cell line. The differential expression of a small number of miRNAs can have an effect on the capability to respond to fludarabine in CLL patients and can be used for response prediction. Therefore our data may help identify those elderly patients unlikely to respond to fludarabine used as single agent and may assist in the definition of the induction treatment in younger patients, given the availability of non cross-resistant drugs, such as bendamustine. This information may have an impact in the development of personalized therapeutic approaches. Seventeen patients (training set) plus 12 patients (test set) followed at our centre and treated with fludarabine as single agent (25 mg/sqm/day for 5 consecutive days for six courses given at 28 day intervals) were enrolled in this study after obtaining informed consent. The training set patients received fludarabine as first line treatment in 4 cases and as second line treatment after chlorambucil in 13 cases. All the patients had typical morphologic features (i.e. majority of small lymphocytes with clumped chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli) and a high immunophenotypic score (i.e. CD5/CD19+, CD23+, CD22 weak positive, surface immunoglobulin weak+, FMC7-), consistent with an unequivocal diagnosis of CLL. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed as previously described as part of the diagnostic workup before treatment. Response to treatment was defined according to NCI criteria and patients were divided in two groups, i.e. those attaining a clinical response (CR) including partial and complete responders and those who did not respond to treatment (NR). For miRNA/mRNA expression studies, peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were separated to a >97% as previously described. In each patient of the training cohort, cells were collected one day before the start of the first course of fludarabine and on day 5 of treatment.

Filters on gene expression were used to keep only the miRNAs/mRNA expressed in at least one sample (flagged as P). Then, samples were grouped in accordance to treatment (pre and post fludarabine) and response to treatment (NR and CR). Differentially expressed genes were selected as having a n-fold expression difference between their geometrical mean among the groups of interest and a statistically significant p-value (<0.05) by Welch t-test statistic.

Differentially expressed genes were employed in Cluster Analysis, using the Manhattan correlation as a measure of similarity and the complete linkage rule for genes and samples clusterization. The identification of mRNAs modulated after fludarabine, in matched samples, was done using the filter on 0-10th percentile in at least 75% of patients, for the miRNAs down-modulated by treatment, and a filter on 90-100th percentile in at least 75% of patients, for the miRNAs up-modulated by treatment.

',\n"," 'Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in phase II clinical development for treatment of various forms of cancer. When administered with a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed dosing schedule, flavopiridol exhibited striking activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study aimed to evaluate pharmacogenetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and outcomes associated with flavopiridol therapy. Thirty-five patients who received single-agent flavopiridol via the PK-directed schedule were genotyped for 189 polymorphisms in genes encoding 56 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Genotypes were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as covariates in a population PK model. Transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in uptake assays in HEK-293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1. Polymorphisms in ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and SLCO1B1 were found to significantly correlate with flavopiridol PK in univariate analysis. Transport assay results indicated both flavopiridol and flavopiridol-glucuronide are substrates of the SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 transporter. Covariates incorporated into the final population PK model included bilirubin, SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. Associations were also observed between genotype and response. To validate these findings, a second set of data with 51 patients was evaluated, and overall trends for associations between PK and PGx were found to be consistent. Polymorphisms in transport genes were found to be associated with flavopiridol disposition and outcomes. Observed clinical associations with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated indicating for the first time its relevance as a transporter of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. A second 51-patient dataset indicated similar trends between genotype in the SLCO1B1 and other candidate genes, thus providing support for these findings. Further study in larger patient populations will be necessary to fully characterize and validate the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other transporter and metabolizing enzyme genes on outcomes from flavopiridol therapy. Flavopiridol (Alvocidib, NSC 649890), is a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that broadly targets cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including the cyclin 9/cyclin T complex (pTEF-b), preventing activation of RNA polymerase II. Flavopiridol initiates cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis through down-regulation of Mcl-1 and X-linked inactivator of apoptosis (XIAP) . These preclinical characteristics provided the rationale for clinical investigation of flavopiridol in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as advanced CLL is commonly associated with elevated Mcl-1 and dysfunctional p53, rendering standard treatments such as alkylating agents, fludarabine and rituximab ineffective. Single agent flavopiridol administered with 72-, 24- and 1-hour infusion schedules produced limited activity in hematologic and solid tumor diseases. ',\n"," 'Phase I and II studies using flavopiridol in combination with other agents utilizing the various schedules obtained mixed results, although partial and complete responses in these trials indicated potential synergy of flavopiridol with chemotherapy. We previously reported overall response rates of 40-50% in patients with refractory CLL when flavopiridol was administered as a single agent using a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed schedule. A phase II registration trial is underway for unmet need in refractory CLL patients using this PK-directed schedule. The activity of the PK-directed schedule in CLL, compared to that of the previously evaluated schedules, clearly indicted the importance of flavopiridol PK for clinical activity, and associations were in fact observed between PK and clinical outcomes, including response, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). However, a substantial amount of variability in PK, as well as in response and toxicity, was unexplained by demographic, patient and disease characteristics. We therefore sought to determine the role of pharmacogenetic factors in flavopiridol PK and treatment outcomes within this patient population. Flavopiridol elimination occurs via excretion and metabolism and is known through in vitro studies to be influenced by the multi-drug resistance protein-2 (MRP2, ABCC2) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2), which contribute to biliary excretion of both parent drug and glucuronide metabolites. Glucuronide conjugation to the 5- and 7-hydroxy positions of flavopiridol by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoforms 1A1 and 1A9 (UGT1A1 and UGT1A9, respectively) accounts for the majority of metabolic transformation of flavopiridol. Polymorphic diversity in these and other genes may influence flavopiridol disposition, activity and toxicity in a manner similar to irinotecan disposition. Limited polymorphism effects on flavopiridol interactions have been reported, including a lack of observed effects on clinical PK and in vitro substrate specificity. Although polymorphisms were not directly evaluated by Innocenti and colleagues, their clinical report suggested flavopiridol:metabolite ratio as a possible predictor of diarrhea with flavopiridol treatment and provided a rationale for evaluation of a genetic link with UGT isoforms. In this report, we present pharmacogenetic (PGx) data for drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) in a subset of 35 patients treated in a phase I study of a PK-derived 4.5-hour dosing schedule of single-agent flavopiridol in relapsed CLL. These data comprise a focused analysis of candidate genes known through in vitro studies to interact with flavopiridol, as well as a broader exploratory evaluation of additional DMET genes. ',\n"," 'interact with flavopiridol, as well as a broader exploratory evaluation of additional DMET genes. The results indicate a novel link between flavopiridol PK and SLCO1B1, as well as functional evidence for OATP1B1 (the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 protein product of SLCO1B1) transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. Preliminary analysis of these associations in a second dataset comprising 51 patients provided additional support for the validity of associations between PK, transporter and UGT1A1 genes and their potential clinical relevance. Importantly, pharmacogenetic factors explain a significant portion of inter-patient variability and improves the accuracy of a developing population PK model for this agent. Samples were obtained from patients who provided informed written consent and were enrolled on clinical protocol NCI-5746 (NCT00058240, ClinicalTrials.gov). The sample collection and analyses reported in this study were outlined in the clinical protocol, as approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient demographics and disease characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes and PK results, were reported previously. DNA was obtainable from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 35 of the 52 patients on study. Demographics, baseline labs and disease characteristics for these patients are presented in Table 1. Genes known from in vitro studies to specifically affect flavopiridol disposition include UGT1A1, UGT1A9, ABCC2 and ABCG2. These and an additional set of 52 other genes that code for metabolic enzymes and transporters commonly involved in drug disposition were evaluated for the presence of known polymorphisms by direct sequencing and with a high-throughput SNPlex assay (Applied Biosystems). Genomic DNA was extracted from patient PBMCs and used to sequence promoter TATA box regions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 and specifically to identify the presence of the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*22 polymorphisms. Primers for UGT promoter sequencing were as follows: 1A1-forward, 5\\' - GGAAGTACTTTGCTGTGTTCACTCAAG; 1A1-reverse, 5\\' - AAGGGTCCGTCAGCATGACATCAA; 1A9-forward, 5\\' - CTTAACATTGCAGCACAGGGCATGTT; 1A9-reverse, 5\\' - CGTACTTGTGCTTTCCATTGAGCATGGG.\"] All sequence data was deposited in GenBank. To validate sequence results of the TATA box regions, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) specific primers were used in a fluorescence/gel-migration assay. Polymorphism-specific primers were utilized in the SNPlex assay to identify the presence of 189 other SNPs in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. A complete list of the genes and SNPs evaluated was presented previously. A population PK (popPK) model for 50 patients on study was previously reported. ',\n"," 'This model served as the starting point to evaluate SNPs and other covariates for the subset of 35 patients with PGx data using NONMEM VI (Icon, Hanover, MD). With first order conditional estimation, a base structural model was built with proportional and additive residual error considering both between-subject variability (BSV) and between-occasion variability (BOV) on PK parameters, since PK data was available on two occasions from patients who received escalated doses. Initial screening of the genetic data was completed with the allelic association test in HelixTree software (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT) which produced unadjusted p-values for correlation with each of the base model-predicted PK parameters. Of the 189 SNPs (191 total including the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*29 promoter polymorphisms from direct sequencing), 16 SNPs in 4 genes known previously to interact with flavopiridol (UGT1A1/9, ABCC2 and ABCG2), were retained for further analysis. From the remaining 175 total SNPs in 52 genes that were known to be involved in drug disposition, we filtered out from consideration SNPs with p-values>0.05 and minor allele frequencies less than 0.15. For direct fitting of selected polymorphisms to PK parameters, SNPs were converted to dichotomous categorical variables whereby the heterozygous category (M/m) for the major (M) and minor (m) alleles was combined with either the major or minor allele category as previously reported. Demographic, baseline laboratory covariates, and the total of 43 SNPs from above screening were then introduced with general additive modeling (GAM) and visual inspection of diagnostic plots using R v.2.9.0 and Xpose 4.0.4. These covariates identified by visual inspection and GAM as potentially meaningful (according to the Akaike information criterion, AIC) were introduced into the population model for further evaluation of the SNP associations. Using GAM, four sets of covariates including SNPs were retained for further evaluation in a full structural model. For completeness, each individual covariate was fit to the structural model using the power (equation 1) or fractional change (equation 2) models, where thetai is the individual PK parameter estimate, thetapop is the population parameter estimate for the typical individual, and etai is the sum of BSV and BOV parameters approximately log-normally distributed with standard deviations omega about a mean of 0. ',\n"," 'CONji is the value of the continuous covariate j for individual I, CONj-med is the population median value of covariate j for all individuals, CATji is the value of the categorical covariate j for individual i, and Thetaj is an estimated parameter. All covariates were evaluated in this way with the full 50-patient dataset, except for the SNPs which were evaluated after removal of individuals for whom no genetic data was available. To identify a final multivariate model for all of the PK parameters simultaneously, we used selection methods that depend on changes in the objective function value. Using a cutoff of p<=.05, which corresponded to a minimum decrease of the objective function value (OFV) of 3.84 upon inclusion of each individual covariate based on the likelihood-ratio test, multivariate analysis with forward stepwise inclusion, backward stepwise deletion, and forward selection followed by backward elimination were applied to finalize the covariate model. Model selection in multivariate analysis was based on 1) minimum reduction of OFV by 3.84 (P<=0.05) for forward inclusion, 2) reduction of OFV by 6.64 or greater (P<=0.01) for backward deletion, and 3) decrease in residual error and/or BSV of the evaluated PK parameter. Interaction between covariates was examined by scatter plot of covariate values and change of OFV between models with single or combined covariates. For bias evaluation the final model was fitted to replicate datasets using the bootstrap resampling technique in Wings for NONMEM, and PK parameter estimates and random effects for each of the replicate datasets were obtained. Two hundred replicate bootstrap datasets were generated and used for evaluation of parameter estimate precision. Model precision was evaluated by comparing mean parameter values and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CI) of the replicates with NONMEM outputs. The human SLC01B1 gene was isolated from the HEP-G2 cell line using methods similar to those previously published. Briefly, RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent and each half of the gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pcr-blunt II Topo vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The second half of the gene was digested with NotI and SnaBI and combined with the first half in the pcr-blunt II topo vector. The full length clone was then digested with KpnI and NotI and transferred into pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen).

Flavopiridol was obtained from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Flavopiridol-glucuronide (flavo-G) was extracted from patient urine and purified. Total urine through 24-hours after the start of flavopiridol dosing was collected from patients enrolled in an IRB-approved phase II protocol (NCI-7000). Octanol extraction followed by C-18 solid phase extraction was employed to isolate flavo-G from flavopiridol and other urine components. To quantify recovered flavo-G and verify purity, samples were incubated with beta-Glucuronidase as previously described and quantified via LC-MS/MS analysis with methods modified from those previously reported. Purity was estimated at >95% via mass and UV chromatography.

Calculated uptake velocities were normalized to total protein in each well, and results were compared against empty vector controls using Student\\'s t-test.\"] To identify associations with genetics, the means of flavopiridol and flavo-G PK parameters were compared based on SNP genotypes using Student\\'s t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\"] For comparisons of PGx and clinical outcomes, SNP genotypes and response or toxicity grading was evaluated using Fisher\\'s exact test.\"] P-values were not further adjusted for multiple testing. DNA of adequate quality and quantity for analysis was available from 35 of the 52 patients treated on study, and both SNPlex and direct sequencing data were generated for these individuals (see Table 1 for demographics and pre-treatment characteristics of this patient subset). In addition to the 4 genes of interest, 17 genes and 27 SNPs met our criteria for further study (see Table 3). Among these, SLCO1B1 was selected for further evaluation given its known physiological relevance for a broad set of drugs and its potential role of transporting flavopiridol into liver for subsequent metabolism and excretion. A total of 577 plasma concentration-time values from 50 of 52 patients in the clinical study were included for PK data analysis using two-compartmental kinetics with first-order elimination, as described previously. Based on this previous analysis, BSV was initially assumed on each parameter in the model. However, removal of BSV for V1 did not significantly change OFV (increase of 1 unit). After removal of BSV on V1, addition of BOV on single or multiple parameters was tested in the model. Addition of BOV on clearance (CL) resulted in the most significant change in OFV. The final base model thus included BSV on CL, inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and volume of peripheral compartment (V2), and BOV on CL. Base model parameter estimates and random effects are presented in Table 4. ',\n"," 'Demographic and lab covariates from GAM screening were subsequently evaluated in the base model with univariate analysis (see Table 5). With the modified random error in the base model, bilirubin was indicated as the most significant covariate with a direct positive effect on Q. Addition of bilirubin decreased OFV by 8.07 and BSV (on Q) from 63.64% to 55.41% (see Figure 1). To evaluate genetic covariates, the dataset was reduced by removing patients for whom no genetic data was available. This reduced the dataset from 50 to 35 subjects and from 577 to 388 records. Univariate analysis on genetic covariates with this dataset identified the 14 most significant covariate-parameter relationships (see Table 6). Using the selection methods discussed above, we retained in all of the final models SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. The relationships between these SNPs and their respective base model-estimated PK parameters are displayed in Figure 2. Although associations between PK and SNPs in ABCC2 may have been expected due to known in vitro interactions of MRP2 and flavopiridol, no such evidence existed prior to this study for the role of SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 in flavopiridol transport. To determine if the observed associations between flavopiridol PK and SLCO1B1 PGx were functionally relevant for flavopiridol disposition, we measured uptake of flavopiridol and flavo-G in cells transfected with SLCO1B1. Transfection efficiencies were estimated at approximately 60% using GFP-containing control vectors. Mean uptake velocities were 261+-12 fmol/mg protein/10 min and 38+-10 fmol/mg protein/30 min for flavopiridol and flavo-G, respectively, in MDCK-II cells. Flavopiridol transport rates in HEK-293 cells were approximately 2-3 fold higher than in MDCK-II cells suggesting its transport may be affected by the different membrane and transporter compositions in the two cell lines. Flavo-G transport rates were similar in both cell lines. Figure 3 shows normalized uptake velocities of flavopiridol and flavo-G in both HEK293 and MDCK-II cells transfected with either SLCO1B1 or empty vector. Expression of the transfected SLCO1B1 gene was verified with real-time PCR (data not shown). Functional expression of OATP1B1 was verified by evaluating uptake of a positive control substrate, SN-38. A second agent, lenalidomide, was used as a negative control substrate. Total intracellular accumulation and Initial transport velocities of SN-38, flavopiridol, and flavo-G were significantly increased in HEK293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1, compared to empty control vectors, whereas no increased uptake was shown for lenalidomide. ',\n"," 'We further evaluated the uptake of flavopiridol in MDCK-II cells transfected with the SLCO1B1 polymorphic variants with amino acid changes relative to the reference sequence (i.e. nonsynonymous SNPs). These included rs11045819 (T155P), rs2306283 (D130N), and rs4149056 (V174A). The results indicated significant decreases in flavopiridol transport rates (t-test p-value<0.05) for the rs11045819 and rs4149056 variants, but the transport rate of the rs2306283 polymorph was similar to that in the reference SLCO1B1 transporter. Figure 4 displays these results. To arrive at a final model with significant PGx, lab and demographic covariates, the reduced data set was used to reevaluate the demographic and lab covariates retained after univariate analysis with the full dataset (see Table 6). Bilirubin effect on Q was apparent and remained the most significant demographic or lab covariate with the reduced dataset. However, significant effects of blood urea nitrogen on CL and alanine aminotransferase on V2 that were observed in the full dataset disappeared with use of the reduced dataset. The remaining four significant demographic or lab covariates and the two significant SNPs (SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710) were then evaluated by forward addition and backward deletion. Only the two SNPs and bilirubin were retained as significant covariates with the reduced dataset. Relative to the base model, the final model displayed an OFV reduction of 34.11. Table 7 lists the final model parameter estimates. The bootstrap method was used to assess bias in the final covariate model. From the reduced data set, 200 replicate data sets were generated and used for the evaluation of the stability of the final covariate model. Table 8 lists the results of the bootstrap procedure, presented as mean and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals of the parameter estimates and random effects of the final model. Mean estimated parameter values from the bootstrap were within 11% of the parameter estimates of the original data set indicating reliability in the developed model. Flavo-G PK parameter estimates reported previously in 27 pts on study were evaluated to identify PGx associations. The trends observed indicated that fewer TA repeats in the UGT1A1 promoter were weakly associated with lower flavo-G Cmax (2.17+/-0.99 vs. 5.08+/-4.12 microM) and AUC (26.43+/-30.26 vs. 66.16+/-64.37 hr* microM) (p = .057 and .077, respectively). Only two transporter SNPs were associated with flavo-G PK. ',\n"," 'The SLCO1B1 rs2306283 SNP correlated with flavo-G plasma concentrations (the total time in hours flavo-G concentrations were below 1.5 microM, p = .019), and the ABCG2 rs1564481 SNP was associated with flavo-G AUC (p = .050). We also evaluated flavopiridol AUC with respect to PGx, and one trend was observed with the ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP (p = 0.08). Bilirubin levels were not associated with SNPs in UGT1A1, but the SLCO1B1 rs3829310 minor C allele was associated with higher baseline bilirubin (p = .011). These relationships are presented in Figure 5. To determine if the presence of polymorphisms was significantly associated with outcomes, clinical response and the primary toxicities (TLS, diarrhea and CRS) were evaluated against PGx. Results indicated SNPs in SLCO1B1 and ABCG2, but not in UGT1A1/9 or ABCC2, were associated with response. SNPs significantly associated with improved response included the SCLO1B1 rs11045819 (CC genotype, p = .041) and ABCG2 rs1564481 (T allele, p = .037). The SLCO1B1 rs2306283 SNP alone did not meet the significance criteria (T allele, p = .061), but the combination of this and the SLCO1B1 rs11045819 SNP was significant (p = .007). No SNPs met the significance criteria when compared against TLS, although the most closely associated SNP was SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (C allele, p = .056). Similaraly, the most closely associated SNPs with diarrhea and CRS were SCLO1B1 rs2306283 (T allele, p = .055) and ABCG2 rs1564481 (T allele, p = .074). To evaluate the validity of the findings from the 35-patient dataset, a second dataset was evaluated for associations between PGx and PK. The validation set comprised data from 66 CLL patients who were treated with the same flavopiridol dosing regimen in a separate phase II study (NCI-7000, NCT00098371). As with the phase I study, enrolled patients provided informed written consent, and plasma and PBMC samples were obtained according to The Ohio State University IRB approved protocol. Clinical results of this study were reported previously. Plasma and DNA samples from this study were analyzed using the methods described above to generate flavopiridol and flavo-G concentration-time data, PK parameter estimates, and PGx data for each patient. Covariates found to be significantly associated in univariate analysis with the phase I dataset, including demographic and baseline laboratory covariates and SNPs in UGT1A1, ABCC2, ABCG2 and SLCO1B1, were compared with the phase II pharmacokinetic data. Significant associations and trends were observed with the validation dataset. ',\n"," 'For flavopiridol PK, these included significant associations between the SCLO1B1 rs2306283 SNP and Q (p = 0.02) and between both the ABCG2 rs2622624 and rs3114018 SNPs and CL and V1 (rs2622624, p = 0.008 and 0.04; rs3114018, p = 0.004 and 0.006 for CL and V1, respectively). The SLCO1B1 rs3829310 SNP was weakly associated with flavopiridol CL and AUC (p = 0.08 and 0.08, respectively). The ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP showed a similar trend with AUC (p = .08). For flavo-G, significant associations included Cmax and AUC with the UGT1A1*28 promotor SNP (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Bilirubin levels were significantly associated with the SLCO1B1 rs3829310 and SLCO1B1 rs2291075 SNPs (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). Figure 6 displays a subset of these relationships. Safe and effective use of flavopiridol will require a thorough understanding of the factors influencing the onset of hyper-acute tumor lysis syndrome and inter-individual variability in response. We previously reported that at least some of the variability in outcomes may be explained by PK, yet significant portions of this variability remain unexplained. In this first evaluation of pharmacogenetics using the flavopiridol PK-derived schedule, we identified a novel flavopiridol-transporter interaction and confirmed its functional relevance in vitro. Furthermore, a subset of the polymorphisms evaluated in this study was significantly associated with outcomes. The striking activity of this dosing schedule in CLL and flavopiridol\\'s emerging activity with combination chemotherapy in other diseases demand these pharmacogenetic and other factors be identified and further characterized.\"] To expand on our previous evaluation of flavopiridol using the PK-directed schedule, we sought to characterize the role of PGx in flavopiridol disposition. We combined focused and exploratory approaches, whereby PK data from a phase I dataset was evaluated against SNPs in candidate genes previously shown to metabolize or transport flavopiridol in in vitro studies, as well as SNPs in genes not known to interact with flavopiridol. The candidate genes evaluated included ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. Indeed, at least one SNP in each of these genes was significantly associated in univariate analysis with flavopiridol and flavo-G PK. In multivariate analysis with the phase I dataset, a single SNP in ABCC2 (rs8187710) remained significant. This is a non-synonymous SNP resulting in a C1515Y alteration and is part of a haplotype with the rs17222723 SNP (also a non-synonymous SNP with a V1188E residue change). ',\n"," 'This haplotype has been reported to be associated with PBMC accumulation of lopinavir, susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This is a relatively infrequent SNP, and only 5 of 35 and 4 of 51 individuals were genotyped for the polymorphic A allele in the phase I and II datasets, respectively. Significant associations between this SNP and PK parameters were not observed in the phase II dataset. Although UGT1A1 SNPs were not included in the final popPK model, both flavopiridol and flavo-G were correlated with the UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism, and fewer TA repeats (6 and 7) were associated with lower flavo-G concentrations and AUC in both the phase I and II datasets. One of the most broadly studied substrates of UGT1A1 and 1A9 is irinotecan/SN-38, which shares metabolic pathways and has a similar toxicity profile (diarrhea) with flavopiridol. Interestingly, the *3 polymorphism of 1A9 was previously shown to be associated with SN-38 but not flavopiridol disposition. Innocenti and colleagues measured ratios of flavo-G:flavopiridol and identified an indirect relationship between flavo-G levels and diarrhea. Zhai and colleagues reported PK and UGT1A1 polymorphism data in 49 patients with refractory neoplasms treated with 1-hour IV flavopiridol. However, their results indicated no correlation of the TATA box promoter UGT1A1*28 genotype with flavopiridol PK or diarrhea severity. While we did not identify correlations with diarrhea for flavopiridol and flavo-G PK, we observed one association with PGx and diarrhea. The 35-patient dataset evaluated in this study was small with regard to exploratory PGx, and therefore an additional dataset from 51 patients was used to evaluate the validity of the findings. While the associations identified in each dataset were not identical, similar trends were observed between PK parameters and SNPs in the candidate genes. Furthermore, the clinical associations we observed with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated in vitro. SLCO1B1 is important for the disposition of statin drugs and various anti-cancer agents including irinotecan. It was recently highlighted by the International Transporter Consortium as one of the seven most relevant transporters for drug development due to its broad substrate specificity, potential for drug-drug interactions, and clinically relevant polymorphisms. Importantly, functional transport data indicated this gene may play a role in hepatic uptake of both flavopiridol and flavo-G. ',\n"," 'All five of the SLCO1B1 SNPs evaluated in the phase I dataset were significant in univariate analysis, and two of these (rs11045819 on V1 and rs4149056 on CL) were the strongest associations observed of any covariates evaluated for flavopiridol PK in multivariate analysis. These are non-synonymous SNPs affecting the amino acid sequence in OATP1B1. Previous studies indicated these variants were associated with reduced uptake activity of the OATP1B1 substrates estrone-3-sulfate, estradiol-17beta-d-glucuronide, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, pravastatin, the SN-38 metabolite of irinotecan and rifampicin in. These reports are consistent with our in vitro data which indicated these SNPs significantly reduced flavopiridol transport, while the other nonsynonymous SNP evaluated (rs2306283) had no measureable effect. Interestingly, this was the only SLCO1B1 SNP significantly associated with flavo-G PK. A recently reported study in MDCK-II cells with this SNP indicated increased transport of bromosulfophthalein and decreased transport of cholyltaurine. Collectively, the data may suggest that the altered protein sequence affects OATP1B1 transport of flavopiridol and flavo-G differently. Further in vitro evaluations of these and other SNPs will be required to characterize their functional impact with respect to flavopiridol and flavo-G disposition. Additionally, the data presented suggests flavopridol may be a weak substrate of SLCO1B1 in comparison with SN-38 under the evaluated experimental conditions. However, characterization of the kinetics of flavopiridol and flavo-G transport via SLCO1B1 will be necessary for understanding the full impact this gene has on overall flavopiridol disposition. The observed associations between PGx and outcomes in this study are encouraging as potential indicators for patient response. While no SNP met the significance criteria for association with TLS, the polymorphism most closely associated with this toxicity was SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (ANOVA p = .056). The strength of the associations between PK, outcomes and multiple SNPs in SLCO1B1 and the confirmation of functional OATP1B1 transport of both flavopiridol and flavo-G support the potential for this gene to be clinically relevant in patients receiving flavopiridol treatment. Overall, analysis of the phase II dataset revealed significant associations with the candidate genes that were supportive of the findings from the phase I dataset. In particular, trends in flavopiridol AUC with respect to the ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP and flavo-G Cmax and AUC with respect to the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism were strikingly similar between the two datasets (see Figures 5 and 6). Again, further validation of these associations will be essential in larger datasets. ',\n"," 'This work modifies and develops further our previously reported population model for the PK-directed schedule of flavopiridol. We demonstrate the most significant covariates in the phase I dataset to be polymorphisms in two transporter genes, SCLO1B1 and ABCC2, and the phase II validation set revealed significant associations with polymorphisms in ABCG2. While larger data sets are necessary to fully characterize the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other genes on flavopiridol PK, our findings are supportive of a clinically significant role for PGx in flavopiridol disposition. The composite data to date suggests inter-individual variability in outcomes from flavopiridol therapy will be due to a combination of pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and potentially other factors related to tumor cell sensitivity to flavopiridol\\'s cytotoxic effects.\"] Inter-individual variability is of particular concern for chemotherapeutic drugs with relatively narrow therapeutic windows. The developing model for flavopiridol PK may ultimately help to explain this variability by incorporating pharmacogenetic and other significant factors. With sufficient data and validation, this model may ultimately serve as a tool for predicting PK and associated outcomes in individuals prior to therapy. If sufficiently robust, such a tool would be clinically useful in identifying individuals likely to respond and/or experience severe TLS or other toxicities upon receiving flavopiridol. ',\n"," 'CLL cells treated with dasatinib in vitro undergo apoptosis via inhibition of Lyn kinase. Thus, in this study we tested the activity of dasatinib in patients with relapsed CLL. Patients were eligible for this phase 2 trial if they had documented CLL/SLL and had failed at least one prior therapy with a fludarabine-containing regimen and if they required therapy according to NCI-WG criteria. The starting dose of dasatinib was 140 mg daily. Fifteen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 59 and a median of 3 prior regimens. All patients had received fludarabine, and 5 were fludarabine-refractory. Eleven of the 15 (73%) had high risk del(11q) or del(17p) cytogenetics. The primary toxicity was myelosuppression, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 10 and 6 patients, respectively. Partial responses by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI 6-44). Among the remaining 12 patients, 5 had nodal responses by physical exam, and 1 patient had a nodal and lymphocyte response but with severe myelosuppression. Pharmacodynamic studies indicated apoptosis in peripheral blood CLL cells within 3-6 hours after dasatinib administration, associated with downregulation of syk mRNA. Dasatinib as a single agent has activity in relapsed and refractory CLL. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the Western world and remains incurable outside of the bone marrow transplant setting. While the median survival for all newly diagnosed patients is over 10 years, there is significant patient to patient variability. For patients who relapse after initial treatment, survival varies from about 3 years in good risk patients treated aggressively to 9-13 months in fludarabine-refractory patients. The reasons for progression and treatment resistance are currently under intensive investigation. CLL cells are believed to proliferate and escape apoptosis in large part from signal pathways originating from the B-cell receptor (BCR). Although the precise mechanisms likely differ between heavy chain mutated and unmutated CLLs, in both forms of the disease Src family kinases (SFKs) are overexpressed, are aberrantly located in the cytosol outside of lipid rafts, and appear to play a crucial role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. In unmutated CLL cells, the signaling from the BCR follows a pattern similar to that in normal B-cells. ',\n"," 'These cells respond to antigen engagement with translocation of the BCR to lipid rafts, where the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located in the intracellular tails of the BCR become phosphorylated by the SFK Lyn. The BCR then phosphorylates Syk kinase, resulting in downstream activation of PI3K, Akt and Mcl-1 as well as MEK/ERK. These events result in enhanced proliferation and survival. In mutated CLL cells, little response to BCR engagement is seen, and no migration of the BCR to lipid rafts is seen. Instead, these cells show constitutive activation of Lyn kinase outside lipid rafts in the cytosol with continual signaling of proliferation and survival pathways. In both mutated and unmutated CLL cells, inhibition of Lyn kinase by selective inhibitors enhanced apoptosis of these cells in vitro through a caspase-dependent mechanism, further demonstrating the key role of Lyn in CLL. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor derived from an aminothiazole scaffold and was originally developed as a pan-Src kinase inhibitor. Once dasatinib was found to bind Abl with an affinity over 100 times that of imatinib mesylate, its development focused on CML, with successful clinical trials leading to its FDA approval in 2006 for the treatment of CML resistant to imatinib. However, dasatinib also inhibits Lyn kinase in vitro with an IC50 of 11 nM, similar to the 1-10 nM IC50 of dasatinib for BCR-ABL. The inhibition of Lyn kinase by dasatinib has been tested in K562 cell lines resistant to imatinib mesylate, and in these cells, apoptosis correlated with inhibition of Lyn phosphorylation. Dasatinib has been extensively studied in CML, initially at doses of 35 mg to 70 mg BID. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the peak concentration of dasatinib occurred at approximately 2 hours while the half life was approximately 5 hours. Dasatinib was well tolerated. In a Phase I trial of dasatinib, CML cells from patients resistant to imatinib mesylate showed rapid and sustained inhibition of Lyn kinase. With the understanding that Lyn kinase may be critical for CLL survival, and given Lyn could be inhibited by dasatinib at tolerable doses, we initiated this phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The use of 140 mg once daily was chosen due to emerging data that the once daily schedule was potentially less toxic and at least as effective in patients with CML. ',\n"," '2 study of dasatinib given once daily to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. The study was undertaken from 2007 to 2008 at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, institutions of the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. The primary objective of the study was to determine the overall response rate by NCI-WG criteria. Secondary objectives were to determine the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, spectrum of toxicities, and pharmacodynamic studies to demonstrate Lyn kinase inhibition and caspase activation by dasatinib in peripheral blood CLL cells. Eligible patients needed to have relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, defined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, with an immunophenotype positive for CD5, CD19, and CD23, with the exception that patients with CD23 negative cells could be eligible as long as cyclin D1 staining was also negative (ruling out mantle cell lymphoma). Patients needed to be at least 18 years of age, have failed at least 1 prior fludarabine containing regimen or at least 2 non-fludarabine containing regimens, have an ECOG performance status of 2 or better, creatinine <3.0 mg/dl, SGOT <3 x ULN (upper limit of normal), ANC >1,000/ul, platelets >50,000/ul, and reticulocyte count <10%. Patients were required to be in need of treatment according to NCI-WG guidelines. Women were excluded if pregnant, breast-feeding, or unwilling to use an acceptable form of contraception if of child-bearing potential. Additional exclusion criteria included uncontrolled angina, a prolonged QT interval at baseline (QTc >450 ms), clinically significant arrhythmias, significant hypertension, or known HIV infection. Drugs known to interfere with platelet function had to be stopped at least 7 days prior to starting dasatinib. The institutional review board of the participating institutions (Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center IRB) approved this study and provided oversight for the duration of the trial. The data were analyzed primarily by P.C.A., E.C.A., D.N., L.W., and J.R.B, but all authors had access to the primary clinical trial data. The clinical trial registration number and name are NCT00438854 and \"Dasatinib in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\". All patients were required to give written informed consent, and the trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients began protocol treatment with a starting daily oral dose of dasatinib of 140 mg (a combination of two 20 mg and two 50 mg pills) and could continue treatment for up to 24 months if responding and without significant toxicity. ',\n"," 'Dasatinib was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Treatment was intended to be continuous, with no planned rest period or breaks. Non-hematologic toxicities were graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3.0, and hematologic toxicities according to the 1996 NCI-WG guidelines. In the event of unacceptable toxicity, defined as any grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicity or any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity, the treatment was held until resolution of the toxicity to grade 1 or less. According to the degree of toxicity, drug could be re-instituted at the same dose or with a dose reduction to 100 mg or 80 mg daily. If the 80 mg daily dose was not tolerated, the patient was taken off protocol due to toxicity. Supportive measures such as blood product support and growth factor administration were allowed at the discretion of the treating physician, with no prophylactic anti-infective therapy mandated. Patients with progression of disease were removed from study. Prior to study treatment, patients underwent the following baseline evaluations: history, physical exam (nodes measured by ruler), complete blood count (CBC), chemistries, liver function tests, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in women, ECG, CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics with analysis by FISH for del(11q), +12, del(13q), and del(17p). Expression of ZAP70 by CLL cells was determined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. In the first month of treatment, CBC, chemistries, and liver function tests were performed at least weekly along with ECGs to assess the QTc interval. For the first 6 months, similar laboratory studies were required at least monthly along with an ECG for QTc assessment. At 2 month intervals up to the 6-month time-point, CT scans were repeated to help assess their impact on response (though not required for NCI-WG criteria). Also at the 2-month time point, a bone marrow biopsy was performed on all patients as a part of response assessment. After 6 months, CT scans were required every 6 months. A bone marrow biopsy was required to confirm a clinical CR or at the time of disease progression, but was not required if patients were removed from the study due to other reasons such as toxicity. ',\n"," \"For a subset of patients who consented to participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study, plasma samples were obtained prior to the first dose of dasatinib and at 3, 6 and 24 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of dasatinib were measured as previously described. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients at baseline, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours after the first dose of dasatinib and prior to day 8 of therapy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were enriched by depleting non-lymphoid cells using the RosetteSep Human B Cell Enrichment Cocktail (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). For analysis of apoptosis, samples of enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes (EPBLs) were stained with anti-Caspase 3 antibody-FITC (Beckton Dickinson) and then fixed in paraformaldehyde and ethanol. Tunel staining was performed using the APO-BRDU Tunel Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), except that anti-BRDU-Alexa Fluor 488 was replaced with anti-BRDU-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). For analysis of protein and phosphoprotein levels, EPBLs were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Sigma). The total protein concentration was identified using the BSA kit (Peirce). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for detection of phophoprotein levels. For p-Lyn, the human phospho-Lyn (Y397) DuoSet IC (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) kit was utilized using 2 ug of total protein lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions. For p-Syk, an ELISA plate was coated with rabbit anti-human p-Syk primary capture antibody (Cell Signaling) and the plate was blocked with BSA. A total of 2 ug of total protein sample lysate was incubated and the plate washed. A mouse anti-human Syk antibody (Sigma) was then added followed by goat anti-mouse biotin and, then streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (both from R & D Systems). The plates were read colorimetrically and the amount of phosphoprotein was expressed as a ratio to the total protein concentration. RNA from EPBLs was extracted, processed, and applied to Affymetrix Human Plus 2.0 microarrays according to standard protocol. Nucleic acid quality was confirmed using gel electrophoresis. The primary objective of this phase II study was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL treated with dasatinib. The primary measures of efficacy of tumor response were: complete remission (CR), nodular partial remission (nPR), or partial remission (PR), as per NCI-WG criteria. \",\n"," 'The true ORR is reported as percentage and 90% CI calculated using the binomial exact test. Patient clinical characteristics are summarized using numbers and percentages for categorical variables, median and range for continuous variables. Duration of on study time was defined from the date patients went on study to the date they were taken off study. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined from the date on study to date of progression, death in remission, initiation of non-protocol therapy in the absence of progression, or censored on the last visit if patients are still on study. Time to progression (TTP) was defined from the time of on study to the date of progression or censored on the off study date if patients had stopped the study. Patients still on study at the time of manuscript preparation were censored at the last visit date. OS was defined from the date on study to date of death or censored on the last visit if patients were still alive as the time of analysis. The method of Kaplan-Meier was used to summarize duration of on study, time to progression, time to treatment failure, and overall survival from the date of on study. In order to identify the differences between gene expression levels of pre and post treatment genes among patients 2 and 3, we first normalized the data at median, then specified the two comparison groups. The threshold of coefficient variation (standard deviation/mean) was set at 1 and 1000 for lower and upper limit as filtering criteria and gene probes differentially expressed at a level of significance (p<.05) were identified. Among the 15 patients enrolled between January 2007 and June 2008 (Table 1), there were 10 male and 5 female subjects with a median age of 59 years (40-78 years). Most were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and had advanced stage disease (7 with Rai stage 3 or 4). All patients had previously received fludarabine, and 5 patients were refractory. Pretreatment bone marrow biopsies demonstrated extensive infiltration (50-95% replacement) with CLL cells in 14 of the 15 patients. By cytogenetic/FISH analysis, there were 3 patients with del(17p), 5 patients with del(11q), and an additional patient with both del(17p) and del(11q). ZAP-70 expression was analyzed in all patients, and 10 patients were classified as positive with >50% expression, while the other 5 patients demonstrated low ZAP-70 expression. ',\n"," 'All 15 treated patients were evaluable for toxicity, and hematological toxicities were frequently encountered (Table 2). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (ANC <1,000/ul) occurred in 10 patients. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (NCI-WG criteria) occurred in 6 patients, but there were no bleeding events reported. Overall, myelosuppression was quite variable among the 15 patients, and 5 were removed from study within 4 months due to this toxicity rather than progression of disease. Two grade 3 infections were observed, both pneumonias that resolved with supportive care, and there were no grade 4 or 5 infections. The other most common non-hematologic toxicities encountered were nausea and fatigue, primarily grades 1 and 2 (Table 2). Four patients developed pleural effusions, which were transient and easily managed by holding the dasatinib and/or using diuretics and steroids. One patient had grade 4 cardiac toxicity due to an asymptomatic QTc of 516 ms, which resolved with repletion of potassium and magnesium. The one grade 4 renal toxicity was a serum potassium of 9.9 mmol/L that was spurious due to leukocytosis, as has been previously reported. For 11 of the 15 patients, study drug was interrupted at some point due to toxicity, with a median duration of interruption of 1.5 weeks with a range of 0 to 8 weeks. Partial responses (PR) by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI 6-44%). Among the 15 patients, 9 (60%) had nodal responses (2 CR and 7 PR) by physical exam (PE), 5 without a 50% reduction in lymphocytosis (see complete table provided as supplemental data). CT scans confirmed a 50% reduction of all nodal and extranodal masses in 4 of the patients (Figure 1), with the other 5 showing less than 50% reduction. The 4 patients with 50% reduction in blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) also had at least 50% nodal responses, but 1 of these patients had severe myelosuppression such that the response could not be counted as a partial response by NCI-WG criteria. The blood responses tended to show both patterns of early and late improvement in lymphocytosis, with response within 7 days in one patient and ongoing improvement after 6 months in others (data not shown). The median duration on study was 14 weeks. ',\n"," 'Ten patients came off study prior to 12 months, 3 of these with progression and 4 due to toxicity, while 3 withdrew consent without progression or significant toxicity. At 12 months, 5 patients remained on study with one starting to progress but the other 4 continuing on treatment in response or with stable disease. The median TTF was 6.7 months. A total of 14 patients experienced treatment failure. Of the 14 patients, 10 of them had disease progression and 4 of them initiated new treatment without progression of disease. The median time to disease progression was 7.5 months. A total of 10 patients experienced disease progression and the rest were censored on the date off study (Figure 2). The median OS of all patients is 27 months. Of the 15 patients, 9 of them have died. Analysis of ALC and lymph node responses showed that for the 5 patients with del(11q), 3 had a blood response and 5 had a nodal response. In fact, two of the three patients achieving NCI WG PR had del(11q). One of the 5 patients with del(17p) responded in lymph nodes but not in blood. Analysis of response by ZAP-70 status showed no clear pattern. Among the 10 ZAP-70 positive patients 1 responded in blood and 5 responded in lymph nodes. One of the 3 patients to respond according to NCI-WG responses was ZAP-70 positive. The pharmacokinetics of dasatinib varied widely among the 3 patients tested, with the 3-hour level in plasma ranging from 19 to 112 ng/ml (see table provided as supplemental data). As expected given the five hour half-life of dasatinib, the 6-hour levels were far below the 3-hour levels, and the 24-hour trough levels were almost undetectable in all three patients. Using staining for TUNEL and activated caspase 3, apoptosis was seen in all three patients assessed, with maximal apoptosis 6 hours after dasatinib (Figure 3, and data not shown for caspase 3). While patient 1 had modest apoptosis, apoptosis was dramatic in 15-20% of enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients 2 and 3. Also within these three patients, we utilized Elisa to determine if levels of Lyn, p-Lyn, Syk, and p-Syk varied in the hours after taking dasatinib. Patients 1 and 3 had relatively low levels of p-Lyn relative to patient 2 prior to dasatinib (Figure 4). ',\n"," 'While levels of p-Lyn remained low in patients 1 and 3, the elevated p-Lyn in patient 2 decreased dramatically after dasatinib. Conversely, p-Syk levels, which were similar in all three patients prior to dosing, increased in patients 1 and 3 and slightly decreased in patient 2 following dasatinib. Of note, patient 2 had a partial response, while patients 1 and 3 did not experience clinical responses (see the associated ALC response at Day 8 provided at the bottom of Figure 4). Finally, the levels of Lyn kinase, p-Lyn, Syk, and p-Syk were compared at baseline and Day 8 of therapy. No association of baseline levels, or change between baseline and Day 8 levels, was seen with clinical response (data not shown). In order to gain biologic insight into whether a dasatinib-induced change in transcriptional program was associated with the brisk apoptosis seen in patients 2 and 3, microarray gene expression profiling was conducted in EPBLs (enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes) and the expression of genes compared in samples obtained before and 6 hours after taking dasatinib. We identified 123 probe sets, corresponding with 106 genes, which were differentially expressed. Of these,102 probe sets were significantly downregulated and 16 probe sets were significantly upregulated in EPBLs 6 hours after taking dasatinib. Functional annotation analysis of genes was performed using the interface DAVID of the National Institutes of Health. The 102 probe sets which were downregulated corresponded to 92 genes. Within the categories of lymphocyte activation/differentiation and leukocyte activation, the genes spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), FK506 binding protein, early growth response 1 (EGR1), NLR family CARD 3, and Notch 2 were significantly (p < .05) downregulated (gene array provided as a supplemental figure). The 16 upregulated probe sets corresponded to 14 unique genes. Among these, the genes GNAS1 and NFKB2 were significantly (p < .05) upregulated (gene array provided as a supplemental figure). Here we report the first full study of dasatinib in CLL, although a case report has recently been published that shows a complete response in a patient treated with single-agent dasatinb. This phase 2 study of single-agent dasatinib in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL demonstrated 3 partial responses by NCI-WG criteria among 15 patients treated. Overall 9 patients had shrinkage of lymph nodes or extranodal masses to less than 50% of their original size, and 4 patients had reduction of ALC by >50%. ',\n"," 'Dasatinib clearly has activity in relapsed CLL/SLL, and responses occurred in subgroups with poor prognostic indicators, particularly those with del(11q). Less activity was observed in patients with del(17p), and although 75% of patients were ZAP-70 positive, only 1 in 3 responders was ZAP-70 positive, suggesting that activity may be better in ZAP-70 negative patients. The small numbers in these subgroups make conclusions difficult, and subsequent studies with greater numbers of patients should reveal any true associations. Dasatinib was reasonably well tolerated in this group of patients. The toxicity most frequently encountered was myelosuppression, with 10 patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred, but bleeding was not a problem, and both myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia resolved promptly after holding the drug. A lower dose of dasatinib or intermittent dosing might reduce the myelosuppression observed. Two patients did require treatment for grade 3 infections but these were easily managed and not unexpected given the patient population. The only other notable toxicities were nausea, pleural effusions, and fatigue. The nausea could be treated with anti-emetics, and the pleural effusions resolved with dose interruptions, diuretics, and steroids. The fatigue generally was mild and tolerable. The greater activity of dasatinib in lymph nodes was not expected but welcome, since patients with advanced refractory disease often have significant lymphadenopathy and few treatment options. The reason for this increased activity in nodes is unclear but several possible explanations exist. Dasatinib may preferentially target proliferating CLL cells which are characteristically found in lymph nodes compared to blood. Another possible explanation is that dasatinib interferes with stromal support of CLL cells in lymph nodes. The mechanisms of stromal support in CLL are complex and multifactorial. For example, it has been established that B-cell survival is enhanced by CD40 signaling. CD40 is a transmembrane receptor that interacts with CD40 ligand present on CD4+ lymphocytes in lymph nodes, and this interaction results in the activation of PI3K and PLCgamma2 followed by the up-regulation of NF-KB and other anti-apoptotic mediators such as survivin, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The intracellular mediator of CD40 signaling is Lyn kinase, and it may be that the inhibition of Lyn by dasatinib interrupts this pathway of stromal support. ',\n"," 'More compelling is a report of an in vitro model which mimics nodal biology, where CD40 stimulation results in relative resistance to chemotherapy agents such as fludarabine through up-regulation in CLL cells of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1, all anti-apoptotic proteins. In this model, exposure to dasatinib completely prevented the entire anti-apoptotic program and rendered the CLL cells sensitive to fludarabine despite concurrent CD40 stimulation. Hence, dasatinib inhibition of Lyn may be particularly important in lymph node biology, and may show greater activity as a chemotherapy sensitizer in combination therapy. To date, the testing of dasatinib in combination with other drugs in CLL has only been performed in vitro, but these reports have been favorable. In one report, CLL cells from patients were treated in vitro with dasatinib, fludarabine, or in combination. Whereas modest apoptosis was seen with each agent alone, combination treatment with both agents enhanced apoptosis by 50%. Dasatinib led to global inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation with down regulation of Akt, ERK1 or 2, MAPK, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and p38. A similar result was demonstrated in a second report, which showed that CLL cells resistant to fludarabine or chlorambucil become sensitive to these agents when also exposed to dasatinib. It seems apparent that, while dasatinib alone may not consistently initiate apoptosis in all CLL cells, the drug clearly inhibits survival pathways that become critical for CLL cells after attack by more conventional chemotherapy agents. The current trial was originally based on the understanding that dasatinib, at concentrations achievable in humans, inhibits Lyn kinase which is overexpressed in CLL and mediates signal transduction from the BCR to downstream effector molecules. To understand the activity of dasatinib further, we investigated levels of p-Lyn and p-Syk and the subsequent apoptosis of EPBLs in a subset of our patients. We were able to demonstrate among 3 patients studied, that one patient had constitutive Lyn phosphorylation that decreased after dasatinib, while the other two patients showed minimal change in levels of p-Lyn. In the patient in whom Lyn was inhibited, no p-Syk was seen and a clinical PR was observed. The other two patients, both of whom showed increased p-Syk following dasatinib dosing, did not show clinical responses. These results are consistent with a recent report that CLL cells exposed to dasatinib in vitro demonstrate widespread p-Lyn inhibition but undergo apoptosis only when p-Syk and PLCgamma2 are also inhibited. ',\n"," \"Interestingly, we identified changes in the transcriptional program of EPBLs associated with apoptosis after dasatinib exposure. Among the genes that underwent downregulation were SYK, which is implicated in lymphocyte signaling and survival and for which inhibitors are currently under clinical study in CLL, FK506BP, which modulates the apoptotic signal of TGF-beta in CLL, EGR1, whose expression is associated with survival in CLL, NLR Card 3, which is downregulated 6 hrs following T-lymphocyte stimulation, and Notch 2, which similarly undergoes downregulation in CLL cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, genes which were upregulated included GNAS1, whose T393C polymorphism has been correlated with prognosis in CLL in one study but not in another. Also, NFKB2, which upregulates the anti-apoptotic bcl-2, was upregulated following exposure to dasatinib and may indicate the cell's molecular attempt to evade apoptosis. Our in vitro results can only be considered suggestive, and further studies need to be done to clarify the relationships between apoptosis and the various signaling molecules. In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this study that dasatinib has single agent activity in relapsed and refractory CLL, particularly in lymph nodes and in high-risk del(11q) patients. Given this encouraging clinical data as well as reports of in vitro studies providing evidence for greater efficacy in combination with other agents, our future studies of dasatinib in CLL are focusing on combination therapy. This is the first completed clinical trial testing the effectiveness of dasatinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We chose to test dasatinib in CLL because pharmacodynamic evaluation of this agent has demonstrated inhibition of Lyn kinase at very low nanomolar concentrations, and Lyn kinase has been shown to be a key enzyme in CLL survival. Recent in vitro studies have confirmed that dasatinib inhibits proliferation and triggers apoptosis in CLL cells. Our trial demonstrates responses according to strict NCI-WG criteria in 3 of 15 treated patients, which indicates effectiveness in this population of patients. We also report in vitro evidence that dasatinib inhibits phosphorylation of Lyn kinase with subsequent inhibition of Syk kinase associated with apoptosis at 6 hours, suggesting the mechanism of action. \",\n"," 'CALGB conducted a Phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with allogeneic transplantation to treat patients with recurrent low grade B cell malignancies. Patients over age 18 with a diagnosis of relapsed, chemotherapy-sensitive disease underwent transplantation with a matched sibling donor and conditioning with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2/d x 3) and fludarabine phosphate (25 mg/m2/d x 5). GVH prophylaxis included cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus low-dose methotrexate. Forty-four evaluable patients with a median age of 53 and median of two prior regimens were accrued. Sixteen patients had follicular NHL and 28 had histologies including 7 indolent B cell lymphomas, 4 mantle cell, 15 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 2 prolymphocytic leukemia pts. The six-month treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 2.4% and three-year TRM was 9%. Three-year event-free and overall survival were.75 and .81 for the follicular patients, .59 and .71 for the CLL/PLL patients, and .55 and .64 for the other histologies. The incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) was 29% and extensive chronic GVHD was 18%. This report demonstrates that allogeneic sibling transplantation with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen is safe and efficacious for patients with advanced indolent B cell malignancies enrolled on a Cooperative Group study. The treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) has traditionally been associated with high response rates, but a generally accepted inability to induce durable remissions and cure in the vast majority of patients with advanced disease. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) share similar characteristics as treatable but incurable malignancies with conventional approaches. Mantle cell lymphoma is a more aggressive malignancy that has recently demonstrated sensitivity and durable remissions following high dose therapy with intensive chemotherapy regimens and transplantation. These approaches have produced encouraging results in this disease and demonstrate improved progression-free and overall survival compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens plus the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab when used as a component of initial therapy. As with its use in mantle cell lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to conventional regimens for indolent lymphomas or CLL has increased the response rate and disease-free survival in these diseases. The addition of rituximab also led to an improvement in overall survival when it was included as a component of salvage therapy in one large study. ',\n"," 'Additional treatments such as 131Iodine tositumomab or 90Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan labeled anti-CD20 bound isotopes are also effective, but not necessarily more so than employing maintenance therapy with unlabelled anti-CD20 antibodies Although these improvements have been gratifying for patients afflicted with these malignancies, eventual progression to refractory disease and death remains a problem. Over the past 20 years, reports have emerged of the value of high-dose therapy with transplantation in treating these illnesses. Early studies with autologous transplants were especially encouraging when the infused marrow product was rendered tumor free by pcr analysis after ex vivo purging with anti-CD20 antibodies. Concerns remain about the risk of late complications such as the emergence of myelodysplasia or acute leukemia in patients treated with this approach and for a number of years, such treatment had fallen out of favor. Recent data has suggested that the use of antibody-mediated in vivo tumor cell purging might be lead to long remissions and possible cure without the high risk of treatment related complications associated with allogeneic transplants, but the durability of these responses and the long term risks of secondary malignancies remain uncertain. Data has emerged from both registry and large single institution studies that allogeneic donor transplants, whether with an ablative or non-ablative approach can be associated with prolonged remission and apparent cure for low-grade NHL patients. Reduced intensity regimens have demonstrated low morbidity and mortality rates associated with these approaches even after relapse following an autologous transplant. As a result of these encouraging single-institution results, CALGB undertook a prospective multi-center trial for patients with relapsed low-grade or mantle cell lymphoma, CLL, PLL, or SLL using matched related donors and a reducedintensity regimen. The current report describes the results of this Phase II study with a single conditioning regimen, GVHD prevention, and supportive care strategy. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate a six-month treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of less than 30% in a multi-center trial for patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL and PLL. The secondary objectives of the trial were to measure the response rates at six and 12 months post-transplant, the event-free and overall survival of this study population and assess the development of the total and T cell chimerism rates in the peripheral blood and marrow at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days. ',\n"," 'the cumulative risk of acute and chronic graft vs host disease, and identifying other treatment-related toxicities such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome and duration of cytopenias. Classical definitions of GVHD were used including a designation of chronic GVHD as that which occurred after day 100. All patients were < 70 years of age, had histologically documented chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or mantle cell lymphoma as follows. Diagnosis of CLL was made according to the NCI 1996 criteria. Histologic documentation of CLL or PLL required a lymphocytosis > 5,000/microl with < 55% prolymphocytes for CLL; patients with >= 55% prolymphocytes were classified as PLL. Histologic documentation of low-grade NHL was made according to the REAL Subtypes: small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular center lymphoma (grade I or II), diffuse predominantly small cell type, or marginal zone B-cell. Patients must have failed at least one prior regimen or have >=3 of the IPI risk factors; age > 60; PS>1; LDH>normal; presence of > 1 site of extra-nodal disease; or stage III/IV disease. Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma required histologic documentation with at least one of the following: immunophenotype with expression of CD5 and CD19 without CD23; cytogenetic analysis with presence of t(11;14); over-expression of cyclin D1, or bcl1 re-arrangement. All patients had stable or responsive disease to their most recent treatment and were >= 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Patients may not have received a prior autologous transplant and not have symptomatic pulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or serious infection. All patients had a matched sibling donor by low-resolution typing at HLA A, B, DR. All patients were staged with a physical exam, CT or PET/CT scan, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and organ function testing. Laboratory values included granulocytes >= 500/microL, platelets, >= 50,000/microL, calculated creatinine clearance, >= 40 cc/min, total bilirubin, <= 3 x ULN, AST, <= 3 x ULN, negative u-HCG or serum HCG if of child-bearing potential, DLCO > 40% and LVEF > 30%. Each participant signed an IRB-approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. Fludarabine was given at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day on Days -7 through -3. Cyclophosphamide was given at a dose of 1 g/m2/day IV on days -5 through -3. ',\n"," 'A target goal of 5-8 x 106 matched sibling donor peripheral blood CD34+ cells were collected following four or five days of G-CSF administration at 10 ug/kg/d on days -5 to -2 or -1, and infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus on day -1 with tapering begun on Day +90 as tolerated with a goal of stopping by Day +150. The rate of taper was adjusted for the presence of signs and symptoms of GVHD. Tacrolimus was tapered more quickly (Day +60 to Day +90) if donor chimerism of CD3 cells was < 50% at Day +60 or if disease progression occurred. A competing risks model was used to simultaneously estimate the probabilities of acute or chronic GVHD and death. A similar competing risks model was used to simultaneously estimate the probabilities of acute GVHD and death. Patients with progressive disease and no evidence of GVHD were tapered off tacrolimus at the time progressive or stable disease was noted. If there was no evidence of active GVHD, then donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given no sooner than 30 days after complete cessation of GVHD prophylaxis treatment. The initial dose of DLI was 1 x 107 CD3 cells/kg. Subsequent doses of DLI could be given at intervals of no less than 30 days in the absence of response or GVHD with doses of 5 x 107 CD3 cells/kg. Antibiotic Prophylaxis consisted of fluconazole, acyclovir, and TMP/SMX per institutional standards. CMV monitoring and therapy were based on positive cultures or pcr testing. G-CSF was administered at a dose of 5 ug/kg/day from day +5 until an ANC of >1000/ul was achieved for 3 consecutive days. Study monitoring, data quality and statistical evaluation were undertaken by the CALGB Statistical and Data Management Centers. The primary endpoint of the study was treatment-related mortality within six months of the day of stem cell infusion (Day 0). The primary hypothesis was that the probability of experiencing a TRM was less than 30%. The null hypothesis, H0, that the TRM rate, p. is less than or equal to .15 (H0: p <0.15) was compared with the alternative hypothesis, HA, that p is greater than or equal to 0.30 (HA: p> 0.30). ',\n"," 'TRM was assessed at three stages with 15 patients accrued per stage and a maximum of 45 patients entered onto the study as long as the stopping criteria for the study were not met. The significance level and power of this design were 0.08 and 0.85, respectively. The time to event distributions for overall and event-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method while the discrepancy between two time to event distributions was tested using the log-rank test. Donor chimerism in peripheral blood as well as CD19, CD3, and CD14/15 selected cells were determined using a pcr-based method that routinely achieved 1% sensitivity. CD19, CD3, and CD14/15 cells were selected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Miltenyi magnetic particles (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of each cell subset was determined by flow cytometry. Two short tandem repeat (STR) loci were amplified for each donor-recipient pair (selected from VWF, D21S11, D18S51, D16S539, PENTA D, D3S1358, FGA, D7S820, D2S1338, D10S2325, D12S391, SE33, PENTA E). Amplicons were separated using an automated nucleotide sequencer (ABI 3100 Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the quantity of each informative allele from duplicate samples was determined using GeneMapper fragment analysis software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Forty-seven patients from 13 different CALGB transplant centers were registered onto this study (Table 1). Three patients never began therapy and will not be included in this analysis of 44 patients who were treated per protocol between August, 2001 and April, 2006. Histologies included 16 follicular, 7 other indolent B cell disease, 4 mantle cell, 15 CLL and 2 PLL pts. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 2.5 years (range 0.4 to 12.4 years). The median number of prior therapies was 3 for the entire group (range 1-6) including a median of 3 for those patients with CLL/PLL or Mantle Cell/Other histologies and 2 prior therapies for the 16 patients with follicular NHL. Four patients had received prior irradiation and 1 of 27 NHL patients had an ECOG performance status greater than 1. Forty-one percent of NHL patients had > 1 site of extra-nodal disease. The majority of patients had either a short duration of initial remission, young age, high-risk disease, or were transplanted following multiple therapies. Overall 6-month treatment-related mortality was 2.3% (1 subject) at day 117 from GVHD and sepsis indicating strong statistical evidence in support of the study hypothesis (Table 2). ',\n"," 'Three additional patients died of non-relapse causes at 18, 19, and 36 months from GVHD and sepsis for a three-year treatment-related mortality rate of 9%. One additional patient died of fungal pneumonia in conjunction with treatment for chronic GVHD 7 years following transplant, while another died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma for an overall non-relapse mortality of 13.6% after a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Twenty-five percent (11/44) of patients experienced grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities, primarily from infection or GVHD. Additional serious toxicities included one pulmonary embolus, one grade 4 sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, and two second malignancies; one of the pancreas and a second of the distal esophagus. The median duration of an ANC < 1000/ul was 8 days (range 0-19) and thrombocytopenia < 100,000/ul was 12 days (range 0-38). Twenty-seven of the 44 patients required no platelet transfusions. The median number of red cell transfusions during the transplant period was 1 (range 0-9) with 13 patients requiring no RBC transfusions. Infectious complications were documented in 67% of patients; viral infections in 32%, including CMV reactivation in 15% of patients and CMV infection in 2 patients, bacterial in 41% and fungal in 20% of patients (more than one type of infection was seen in multiple patients). An additional 30% of patients had site-specific infections for which no organism was identified. As described in Table 3, the median % of peripheral blood donor T-cell chimerism at days 30, 60 and 180 were 88, 94, and 97% respectively. Comparable values for unfractionated (lymphoid + myeloid population) peripheral blood chimerism at days 30, 60, and 180 were 80, 85, and 99% respectively. While these median values were high, a significant percentage of patients demonstrated a persistent mixed chimerism picture out to day 180. Greater than 90% peripheral blood donor T cells was seen in 45, 61, and 64% of patients at days 30, 60, and 180 post-transplant. Likewise, > 90% unfractionated peripheral blood donor chimerism was seen in 26, 36, and 65% of patients at days 30, 60, and 180 respectively. (Table 3) Thus, if full donor chimerism was defined as > 90% donor cells, then 64 and 65% of patients showed full donor engraftment in the unfractionated and lymphoid compartments respectively by six months. Bone marrow and peripheral blood gave similar chimerism results at each time point. Finally, no correlation was observed between chimerism status and relapse. ',\n"," 'The overall incidence of grades 1-4 acute GVHD was 61% of which 11% was grade 2, 16% grade 3, and 2.3% grade 4. Twenty-nine point three (29.3) percent of patients experienced limited and 18% had extensive chronic GVHD. Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as time to progression or death due to any cause (Table 4). There have been 18 events. Twelve patients have relapsed at 3 (3 pts), 4 (1 pt), 6 (2 pts), 9(1 pt) 15 (2 pts), 20 (1 pt), 29 (1pt) and 45 (1 pt) months post transplant. The other 6 events were deaths in the absence of relapse due to GVHD (2), sepsis (2), fungal pneumonia in the setting of chronic GVHD (1) and adenocarcinoma (1). While most patients with lymphoma achieved optimal response within the first three months post-transplant, the CLL/PLL cohort demonstrated a slower pace of response with the median time to CR being 3.5 months, but one patient reported as requirig 9 months and another 22 months post-transplant. Six of 17 patients with CLL/PLL, 3/16 with follicular and 3/11 patients with other indolent B cell malignancies have relapsed. Four patients received DLI for progressive disease and subsequently died of their malignancy. The other relapsed patients were felt to be ineligible for DLI either because of uncontrollable relapse or pre-existing GVHD. One additional patient received DLI for a stable partial response and one for loss of chimerism. Both remain in complete remission more than four years post transplant. For the 30 patients still alive, the median follow-up is 4.6 years. The EFS at 3 years for follicular patients was 0.75 (.46-.90), compared to 0.59 (.33-.78) for CLL/PLL and 0.55 (0.23-.78) for the other and mantle cell histologies combined (Figure 1). Fourteen deaths have occurred from progressive disease (7), infection and GVH (6, one of which occurred following a second transplant for relapsed disease), and a second malignancy (1). Overall survival at 3 years is 0.81 (.51-.93) for the follicular histologies, 0.71 (.43-.87) for CLL/PLL and 0.64 (.30-.85) for the other and mantle cell histologies, respectively (Figure 2). Despite the recent advances in standard therapies, treatment outcomes for patients with indolent B cell malignancies remain suboptimal, as life expectancies are clearly reduced by these diagnoses. ',\n"," 'For those patients who are seeking a cure, stem cell transplantation has been available for many years, although late recurrences and the development of secondary myelodysplasia have undermined the utility of autologous transplants while treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and lack of suitable donors have limited the use of allogeneic transplants. Recently, the use of reduced intensity regimens has markedly reduced early morbidity and mortality following allogeneic transplantation. While early relapse and later complications of chronic graft vs host disease and infection remain a problem, the overall success with these reduced intensity regimens have all indicated a plateau on the survival curves with 4 year or longer disease free remission rates exceeding 60% for chemotherapy-responsive patients. The data from Khouri is especially encouraging with the use of transplant and high-dose rituximab as the progression-free survival (PFS) in that trial exceeded 80% at five years with a very low incidence of acute and chronic GVHD for matched related transplant patients. A treatment regimen including the identical schedule and dosage of rituximab is currently being evaluated in a multi-center trial sponsored by an intergroup collaboration between the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT-CTN), CALGB, ECOG, and SWOG. In the current report, the fact that a multi-center group was able to conduct an allogeneic transplant study that yielded excellent outcomes with only a 2.3% six month TRM was very encouraging. Recent mortality rates from other trials are similar, but at the time the study was planned, there was no Cooperative Group experience with reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant on which to base an expectation of TRM. Morbidity was also low, with an overall incidence of grade IV non-hematologic toxicities of 25% including an 11% incidence of pulmonary complications that consisted of pneumonitis, infection, and alveolar hemorrhage. Severe hepatic and renal toxicities were rare and the overall incidence of infections included 5% CMV infection and 15% reactivation, 41% bacterial, and 20% documented fungal processes. The overall incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD was 29%. Thirty percent of patients had limited and 18% had extensive chronic GVHD. While these numbers are somewhat higher than those reported by groups that have used alemtuzamab as a component of the conditioning regimen, reactivation of CMV is less frequent, and the need for donor lymphocyte infusion for relapse appears lower in the current study. ',\n"," 'At day 30 post-transplant, only 26% of patients demonstrated > 90% unfractionated peripheral blood donor chimerism and 45% demonstrated > 90% T cell donor chimerism. By day 180, the % of patients with > 90% unfractionated and T cell donor chimerism had increased to 65 and 64% respectively. At the same time points, the median percentage of donor T cell chimerism was higher and reached 85 and 94% by day 60, and 99 and 97% by day 180. Thus, while the median % of donor cells is high in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments by day 180, only about 2/3 of patients achieved full donor chimerism in both components of the peripheral blood by as late as 6 months following transplant. If the approach encouraged by Thomsen and colleagueswas followed, this could lead to donor lymphocyte infusions for as many as 1/3 of the patients, even in the absence of disease progression. Peripheral blood and marrow values correlated well with one another. The lack of correlation between relapse and chimerism status may reflect small numbers of patients in our study or alternatively, indicate that partial chimerism may in fact be sufficient to maintain an anti-tumor effect while associated with a low rate of long term GVHD in most patients. Our results are somewhat different from the report by Thomson where relapse was lower in those patients who converted from partial to full donor chimerism after DLI infusions compared to those who remained with a mixed chimerism status despite DLI. They also reported a higher remission and durable remission rate in those relapsed patients who received DLI than we observed, perhaps due to earlier intervention at a time of less advanced disease. Alterations in the immunosuppression regimens used or early infusion of DLI might enhance the rate and frequency of full donor chimerism, but one would expect this to be associated with an increased rate and severity of GVHD. Despite these concerns, the Thomson results were excellent, with 76% of patients remaining progression-free at four years with only 18% having extensive chronic GVHD. There were 14 deaths reported to date in the CALGB study including nine in patients who had relapsed and required additional therapy. One patient died from a pancreatic cancer, 2 years post transplant. Five patients died of infection related to GVHD at 4, 18, 19, 36, and 72 months post transplant. ',\n"," 'Significant challenges remain to the successful application of this approach. While the use of well-matched unrelated donors has not had a negative impact in recent reports of transplant studies for acute leukemia, data on approaches using such donors in low-grade malignancies is just emerging. Recent reports by the EBMT and CIBMTR have indicated that while use of unrelated donors resulted in a somewhat higher incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, the overall rates of progression, morbidity, and mortality compare favorably to outcomes following fully-ablative transplants. It is notable, however, that the recent paper by Thomson reported higher rates of progression-free survival in their matched related than unrelated patients, even with a reduced intensity regimen. While 53 is relatively old for allogeneic transplants, it is young for low grade NHL and CLL populations and in future trials, one would anticipate an even higher median age and likely a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Whether the relapse rate could be reduced further by more intensive therapy remains a question to be considered given the high rate of toxicity and low success rate associated with frank relapse followed by DLI in the current study. Of the six patients who received DLI, four died from progressive disease despite the onset of significant GVHD while the two patients infused with DLI for loss of chimerism and stable partial remission remain in CR more than two years beyond DLI infusion. This suggests that careful monitoring for relapse and early use of DLI may be a more effective strategy than delaying such efforts until frank recurrence is observed. Although the number of enrolled patients with low-grade NHL or CLL are less than in the Khouri or Thomson trials, our results are remarkably similar, especially for the follicular lymphoma patients. Even in more aggressive diseases such as prolymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma, there appears to be a plateau on the event-free survival curves, albeit with median follow-up that remains less than four years. While the number of patients is small, we have only had one patient relapse beyond 2 years in this study, suggesting that most responses will be durable. This is consistent with the results published by the M.D. ',\n"," 'Anderson group in which non-ablative allogeneic transplant appeared to confer a higher likelihood of prolonged disease-free survival in mantle cell patients, especially in those with relapsed or refractory disease, compared to what had been achieved with autologous transplantation. Also of note is the prolonged time to best response that can be seen in these patients, particularly those with CLL. This likely reflects in part the slow time to establishing full donor chimerism which is associated with the graft vs leukemia effect that is known to occur in these patients but which can take months to develop. Our results testify not only to the efficacy of this approach, but confirm that this treatment can be undertaken safely and effectively in a large number of transplant-centers by following rigorous protocols. ',\n"," 'Acadesine has shown in vitro to selectively induce apoptosis in B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. We conducted a phase I/II open-label clinical study, to determine the safety and tolerability of acadesine given intravenously as a 4-h infusion to CLL patients. Patient population included CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease who had received one or more prior lines of treatment including either a fludarabine or an alkylator-based regimen. Twenty-four patients were included: eighteen in Part I treated at single doses of 50-315 mg/kg, and six in Part II, three with two doses at 210 mg/kg and three with five doses at 210 mg/kg. A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg; 210 mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal biological dose (OBD). Grade >=2 hyperuricemia occurred commonly but was not clinically significant and resolved with the administration of prophylactic allopurinol. Other adverse events included transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia (not clinically significant), renal impairment, and transient infusion-related hypotension (clinically significant). Trends of efficacy such as a reduction of peripheral CLL cells and reduction in lymphadenopathy were observed; however, the results were variable due to the small population and the range of doses tested. A MTD of 210 mg/kg was established with single acadesine dose. Multiple dose administrations at the OBD were tested with an acceptable safety profile, showing that acadesine might be a valuable agent for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent type of leukemia in the Western world, affecting mainly the elderly. CLL follows an extremely variable clinical course, with overall survival times ranging from months to decades. The symptoms and signs of the disease arise from a clonal excess of B cells caused mainly by defects that prevent programmed cell death (apoptosis). Available treatments for CLL generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse and CLL remains an incurable disease. Fludarabine-based regimens have significantly improved the efficacy of CLL treatment, and recently, a large randomized trial showed that the addition of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in treatment-naive patients (as first-line therapy) and PFS in relapsed patients. However, current chemotherapy is not selective for CLL cells, and attendant T-cell apoptosis leads to adverse reactions, including severe and prolonged immunosuppression. ',\n"," \"Conventional treatment of CLL is also associated with temporary myelosuppression with a concomitant increased risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding/bruising. Almost all patients relapse or become resistant to existing therapies, especially those with genomic alterations such as deletion 17p and/or mutations in TP53. Both have been shown to predict for poor response to chemotherapy and to be associated with poor OS. Acadesine (Acadra ), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-d-ribofuranoside or AICA-riboside, is a water soluble nucleoside with a different mechanism of action compared to currently approved nucleoside analogs (e.g., fludarabine). When added to cell cultures or administered to animals or humans, acadesine is phosphorylated to its ribotide, AICA-ribotide (ZMP). ZMP is a natural endogenous intermediate in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Acadesine induces apoptosis of CLL cells cultured ex vivo in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range 50 muM to 1 mM, and with an IC50 of 380 +- 60 muM. Incorporation of acadesine into the cell and its subsequent phosphorylation to ZMP are necessary to induce apoptosis. Moreover, acadesine is not reliant on the p53 tumor suppressor or ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) proteins to drive apoptosis, and hence, the absence/loss of function of these proteins in patients with CLL should not affect the activity of acadesine. This is an important issue because alterations of either p53 or ATM are related to resistance to chemotherapy in CLL. Also, no significant differences in acadesine-induced apoptosis have been observed in ex vivo analysis between unmutated and mutated CLL samples and either between ZAP70 positive and ZAP70 negative cases. Ex vivo, B cells were found to be much more sensitive to acadesine-induced apoptosis than T cells. Given that fludarabine causes both B- and T-cell apoptosis, the latter leading to the common and severe complication of immunosuppression, the B cell targeted mode of action of acadesine could provide a safety benefit over other commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens and a valuable treatment alternative to certain groups of patients with CLL who are refractory to other treatments. This phase I/II study was approved by the competent institutional review board and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00559624). A total of 24 patients were enrolled in the study. All of them provided written informed consent, prior to any study related procedure not part of the patient's normal medical care. \",\n"," \"part of the patient's normal medical care. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of CLL according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group Criteria, with refractory or relapsed disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status <=2, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. They had received one or more prior lines of treatment which must have included either a fludarabine- or cladribine-based regimen or an alkylator-based regimen. Refractoriness was defined as any patient who had failed to achieve a complete response (CR), nodular partial response (nPR), or partial response (PR) according to the NCI Working Group Guidelines for CLL. Fludarabine refractoriness also included patients who achieved a CR, nPR, or PR of <=6 months duration. Other inclusion criteria were adequate renal function, defined by serum creatinine <=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and a calculated creatinine clearance of >=60 mL/min. This was a Phase I/II, open-label, study to evaluate an escalating dose and number of doses of acadesine in patients with CLL. The primary endpoint of the study was to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of acadesine in CLL patients, and the secondary endpoints were to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of acadesine and its metabolite, ZMP, and to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) of acadesine in patients with CLL. OBD for single-dose administration of acadesine was considered as the dose enabling a plasma concentration in the range of that causing apoptosis in in vitro models determined from the PK and safety data, and was defined as the dose below that at which dose escalation is stopped in Part I of the study and this dose will be the starting dose used in Part II of the study which will assess repeat dosing with acadesine. Patients were enrolled in the study in cohorts of three patients or more, depending upon the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Day 1 dosing was staggered between all patients in each cohort by a minimum of 48 h. In Part I, patients received a single dose of acadesine on Day 1. In Part II, patients received up to 5 doses of acadesine over a period of up to 15 days starting on Day 1. The starting dose for Part I was 50 mg/kg given as a 4 h (+-30 min) intravenous (iv) infusion on Day 1 only. \",\n"," 'Patients were assessed for safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) for up to 3 weeks after dosing (to Day 22). Investigators were advised to treat patients with prophylactic allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia in all patients in Part I from Cohort 2 onward; additionally, a specific dose and duration of treatment of allopurinol was specified for Part II. The decision to escalate to the next dose in a separate cohort of patients was based on the assessment of safety, including any DLTs, PK modeling of exposure to ZMP, and PD response data, where available, by the independent Data Monitoring Board (DMB). Dose escalation in Part I of the study followed a modified Fibonacci dose escalation design, with 100 % dose escalations allowed until a confirmed grade 2 toxicity (as defined by NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 for all toxicities except anemia and thrombocytopenia where CTCAE version 2.0 adapted for leukemia studies was used) considered related to treatment occurred. Once this occurred, future dose escalations were incremental (67, 50, 40, 33 %, etc.). In Part II, patients were treated with 2 or 5 consecutive doses at the MTD/OBD identified in Part I of the study. Incidence, causality, and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), local tolerability, changes in laboratory values (including liver enzymes, blood glucose and uric acid) and vital signs were assessed. They were assessed for their relationship to acadesine and classified for severity according to the CTCAE v3.0 for all events except anemia and thrombocytopenia which were assessed according to CTCAE v2.0 (which uses % changes relative to study baseline/entry). In Part I of the study, blood samples for PK analysis (for both acadesine and its metabolite ZMP) were taken pre-dose and 0, 30, 60 min, 2, 6, 20, 72, 96, and 168 h, 14 and 21 days post-dose in all cohorts. In Part II, PK samples were also taken at pre-dose and 0 min and 20 h post-dose for any interim doses, and 72, 96, and 168 h and 14 and 21 days after completion of the last dose for each patient. Acadesine and ZMP concentrations were determined by a validated bioanalytical HPLC-MS/MS method, with lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) set at 20 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL for acadesine in human plasma and ZMP in whole blood, respectively. ',\n"," 'A noncompartmental PK analysis of the acadesine and ZMP concentrations was undertaken using the WinNonlin software, Professional Version 5.3 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Although no International Working Group (IWG) disease response assessments were included in the protocol, bi-dimensional nodal area (sum of right neck, left neck, right axillary, left axillary, right inguinal and left inguinal nodes) and uni-dimensional lymph nodes (liver and spleen length) were measured. The PD effect of acadesine in patients with CLL was assessed by B-cell and T-cell counts in peripheral blood. Samples were taken at pre-dose and 20, 72, 168 h, and 21 days post-dose in all cohorts. In Part II, PD samples were also taken at pre-dose and 20 h post-dose for any interim doses, and 72, 168 h and 21 days after completion of the last dose for each patient. From January 2008 to January 2011, 24 CLL patients with refractory or relapsed disease were enrolled onto this phase I/II clinical trial. The pretreatment characteristics are listed in Table 1. Patients were between 56 and 79 years old, all diagnosed with CLL between 4 and 21 years (inclusive) prior to study entry. The majority were males (15 patients, 63 %) and had received between 1 and 13 previous lines of therapy (mean 2.7). All patients had an ECOG score of <=2 and had received either a fludarabine- or cladribine-based regimen or an alkylator-based regimen, in accordance with the eligibility criteria. Individual Rai and Binet staging and relapsed/refractory status at screening are displayed in Table 2. In Part I of the study, patients received a single dose of acadesine on Day 1 at escalating doses: 50 mg/kg (6 patients), 83.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 139.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 210 mg/kg (3 patients), and 315 mg/kg (3 patients). At the 315 mg/kg dose level, 2 of the 3 patients experienced a DLT. Also, PK data indicate that at 315 mg/kg, a plateau in acadesine conversion to ZMP was reached. Therefore, 210 mg/kg was designated per protocol MTD and OBD for single acadesine administration based on the decision of the DMB. The dose administered in Part II (210 mg/kg) was based on the results of Part I. ',\n"," 'In view of the possible risk of acadesine-related renal adverse events or laboratory evidence of creatinine elevation, either as part of a clinical tumor lysis syndrome or occurring as isolated renal impairment, acadesine in Part II Cohort 1 was to be administered with a minimum of a 72-h interval between each dose. Thus, 3 patients received 2 doses (on Days 1 and 4) and 3 patients received 5 consecutive doses (on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, and 15). Acadesine infusions were well tolerated. No acadesine-related deaths occurred in the study, and no patients withdrew from the study due to AEs (all causality, either related or not related to the study drug), in either the single or repeated dose part of the study. In Part I, a total of 78 AEs were reported in 15 (83 %) patients, and approximately half of all AEs were reported as drug-related (42 AEs, 54 %. See Table 3). Six SAEs were reported in 2 patients in the 50 mg/kg (3 SAEs) and in 2 patients in the 315 mg/kg (3 SAEs) cohorts. In Part II, a total of 48 AEs were reported in 6 patients, over half of all AEs were reported as drug-related (31 AEs, 65 %. See Table 3), and there were no SAEs. Among all study patients, a single CTCAE grade 4 AE was reported (hyperuricemia) and 9 CTCAE grade 3 events (in 6 patients) were reported. In part I of the study, one patient at 50 mg/kg experienced hyperuricemia (CTCAE grade 4, DLT but not reported as an SAE). As a result, prophylactic allopurinol was administered to patients in the higher dose cohorts, and no further hyperuricemia AEs occurred. Two patients, one at 210 mg/kg and one at 315 mg/kg, reported acadesine-related transient hypotension, CTCAE grade 1 and 2, respectively, starting after acadesine infusion and resolved the day after acadesine dosing (Day 2) with no clinical sequelae. Only the patient treated with 315 mg/kg required treatment (a sodium chloride iv infusion) and had concomitant AEs of presyncope (vasovagal syndrome) and nausea, both CTCAE grade 1. In Part I, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs in Part I were anemia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2, reported in 3 patients, all of them with hemoglobin values below the normal range at pre-dose) and diarrhea, reported in 2 patients, of CTCAE grade 1 (see Table 3). ',\n"," 'At 315 mg/kg, 2 out of 3 patients experienced DLTs: the first patient experienced a tumor lysis syndrome (classed as a SAE, CTCAE grade 3), which resolved within 13 days with rasburicase treatment. The second patient, diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma and a large abdominal lymphomatous mass, reported renal impairment/increased creatinine (both reported as SAEs and CTCAE grade 3), which resolved quickly (returning to grade 1 within 14 days) with conservative treatment (no dialysis required). In the repeat dose phase, no SAEs were observed. There was evidence of transient increases in creatinine after dosing in the 5 x 210 mg/kg repeat dose cohort: one DLT was reported in one patient (increased creatinine; CTCAE grade 2) and an AE was reported in another patient (increased creatinine; CTCAE grade 1), both patients having normal creatinine levels at baseline. One patient treated with 2 doses at 210 mg/kg reported acadesine-related hypotension (CTCAE grade 2), which resolved spontaneously within 24 h, without treatment and without clinical sequelae. In Part II, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs during repeat dosing were anemia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2; reported in 5 patients, 4 of them with hemoglobin values below the normal range at pre-dose), thrombocytopenia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2, reported by 2 patients, one of them with platelets pre-dose levels below the normal range), and nausea (reported by 3 patients; CTCAE grade 1 or 2). There was reduction in the size of palpable lymph nodes after single and repeat dosing with acadesine, although it should be noted that formal IWG response criteria assessments were not planned in this phase I/II study. In Part I, 11/18 patients showed evidence of anti-leukemic activity, in terms of decreases in B cells and/or decreases in the size of lymph nodes (decreases >20 % at any time after dosing with respect to pre-dosing values in either B-cell counts or lymph nodes size. See Table 4). In Part II, 5/6 patients showed evidence of anti-leukemic activity according to the same criteria. For example, a patient with Del13q14 and Del17p, treated at 50 mg/kg, experienced a sustained reduction in B-cell counts, which at Day 22 post-treatment was 58 % lower than at baseline. Also, one patient treated with five doses at 210 mg/kg experienced a reduction in B-cell counts up to 65.7 % on Day 8 post-baseline. This patient had lymph nodes involvement and paraneoplastic skin manifestations. ',\n"," 'The lymphocyte count has continued to drop, and 18 months after acadesine treatment, lymphocyte count is below 5,000/muL, and there are no signs of disease in lymph nodes or skin. Although we only had data from 3 patients per cohort (6 in cohort 1), we compared the B- and T-cell mean values at every post-treatment time with values at pre-treatment. Changes in T-cell counts were inconsistent across the cohorts and no overall significant trend was apparent. For B cells, statistically significant decreases occurred at some time points in some cohorts (see Table 4). In cohort 1, decrease in B cells at Day 2 was statistically significant using parametric (p = 0.012, Student t test) or nonparametric (p = 0.043, Wilcoxon signed rank test) method. Similarly, when pre-dose B cells were compared to Day 2 results in all 15 patients from the single-dose cohort where both values are available, a significant difference was found by both statistical methods (p = 0.038 and p = 0.027, respectively). This suggests a trend in decrease in B cells and tends to confirm the results from in vitro experiments, where acadesine induced apoptosis selectively in B cells. Results showed that acadesine and ZMP were rapidly distributed in the bloodstream, and acadesine was rapidly converted into ZMP. Maximum acadesine concentrations were observed at the end of the infusions and from then on concentrations started to decrease. The LLOQ for acadesine was reached between 20 h and 15 days. Maximum concentrations of ZMP were found between the end of the infusion and 30 min-1 h later due to the time elapsed between acadesine administration and its transformation into ZMP. Blood ZMP concentrations started decreasing progressively from 1 h on (after the end of the infusion), reaching the LLOQ between 5 and 22 days after administration (Fig. 1). At the OBD (210 mg/kg single dose), maximum concentration (Cmax) for acadesine was 38,736 ng/mL and 270,988 ng/mL for ZMP (median of the 3 patients treated in the cohort). The Area under the curve (AUC0 24) was 123,124 ng h/mL for acadesine and 2,066,170 ng h/mL for ZMP (median of 3 patients treated in the cohort). ',\n"," 'Considering that the sum of the Cmax molar plasma concentrations of acadesine and ZMP, obtained at the end of the 4-h infusion, would be equivalent to the dose used in an in vitro cell culture, at the OBD dose (210 mg/kg single dose) target acadesine concentrations were achieved (median acadesine + ZMP concentration was 0.9 mM, higher than the 0.5 mM concentrations used to induce apoptosis in in vitro cell cultures)). Time of maximum drug concentration (Tmax), maximum drug concentration (Cmax), area under the time-concentration curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0 24), and half life (t1/2) for all cohorts are summarized in Table 5. The PK analysis of both acadesine and ZMP demonstrates a high degree of inter-subject variability. For both cohorts in Part II, there was no important accumulation of acadesine or ZMP upon multiple dosing. Following single-dose infusion of acadesine, there was a trend toward a plateau in ZMP levels after increasing the acadesine dose from 139.5 to 210 mg/kg. PK data at 315 mg/kg and PK modeling indicate a plateau in acadesine conversion to ZMP. Thus, the OBD determined from the PK and safety data was 210 mg/kg. This study was the first administration of acadesine in cancer patients:specifically CLL. A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine in patients with CLL at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg. The key safety findings with regard to AEs and clinical laboratory results were asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient renal impairment/increased creatinine, and infusion-related hypotension. Hyperuricemia has been documented in previous studies with acadesine administered to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury, and given that acadesine is metabolized to uric acid, hyperuricemia was not unexpected in patients with CLL. Prophylactic allopurinol adopted from cohort 2 (Part I) resulted in no further hyperuricemia occurring in the study. Four patients had renal impairment during the study (two received 315 mg/kg and two 5 x 210 mg/kg). All of them recovered with appropriate management and none of them required dialysis. Two independent nephrologists reviewed data from all patients and conclude that the renal dysfunction associated with acadesine treatment exhibited functional characteristics rather than nephrotoxic features, based on the rapid reversibility and full recovery of the renal dysfunction even after several acadesine consecutive doses. They proposed renal function monitoring and prophylaxis measures that will be implemented in the following clinical trials with acadesine. ',\n"," 'Modest (grade 1 or 2), transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, with recovery to baseline levels occurring in most patients within last days of acadesine administration, were reported in 3/18 and 5/6 patients treated in Part I and Part II of the study, respectively. All but one these AEs were drug-related, and none of them were clinically significant. Acadesine-related transient hypotension occurred in 3 patients in this trial. The hypotension typically occurred after acadesine infusion and lasted several hours with no clinically significant sequellae. Recovery occurred either spontaneously or with conservative (iv fluid administration) management. Of note, there was no evidence of renal toxicity or hypotension in pre-clinical studies or in cardiac studies in more than 2,000 patients who were administered acadesine. This is the first time that the PK of acadesine has been investigated in patients with CLL. The results indicate a high degree of inter-subject variability. Several possible factors may be contributing to this observation, for example: the underlying disease, associated co-morbidities, and co-medication. The OBD, that is, the dose enabling a plasma concentration in the range of that causing apoptosis in in vitro models determined from the PK and safety data, was 210 mg/kg. In terms of disease activity, there were no conventional IWG responses in this study; such assessments were not prospectively planned as is typical in a phase I trial. However, there was evidence of anti-leukemic activity in 16/24 patients based on a more than 20 % reduction in either B-cell count or size of palpable lymph nodes. In vitro anti-leukemic activity independent of genetic alterations has been previously described with acadesine by Pairet and collaborators. Our study size is too small to draw definitive conclusions, but indications of anti-leukemic activity were seen in patients with poor prognosis genetic alterations, suggesting that acadesine might be a potential treatment option in this sub-group. The absence of significant reduction in T-cell counts with acadesine in this study is in agreement with ex vivo data which showed B cells were more sensitive to acadesine-induced apoptosis than T cells. This is in contrast with current chemotherapy agents, such as fludarabine, which cause long-lasting T- and NK-cell depression. Although early indications from this study are that acadesine does not induce T-cell apoptosis to the same extent as existing treatments, larger scale studies will be required to confirm this in the wider population. ',\n"," 'In conclusion, this study has defined the DLT, MTD, and OBD of acadesine and also shows provisional evidence of acadesine anti-leukemic activity, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. Assessment and monitoring of renal function is essential in patients receiving acadesine. The modest myelosuppressive profile observed with acadesine (if confirmed in larger trials) may make it either an attractive combination partner for standard of care agents used in CLL patients or a candidate for post-induction intervention. The p53-independent mechanism of action of acadesine makes it an attractive compound in patients bearing alterations of this pathway, which represent a significant group in advanced patients, and for whom few therapeutic options are available. Preliminary data also show that acadesine has in vitro toxicity toward other B-cell malignancies, such as mantle cell lymphoma (especially when combined with monoclonal antibodies) and multiple myeloma. ',\n"," \"Patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can be treated by subsequent immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). But unlike myeloid leukemia, B cell leukemia and lymphoma are less sensitive to allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy. Moreover, the beneficial graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect may be associated with moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches augmenting the anti-tumor efficacy of DLI and dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD are needed. The anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) FBTA05 may improve the targeting of tumor cells by redirecting immune allogeneic effector cells while reducing the risk of undesirable reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD. Based on this underlying treatment concept and on promising data taken from preclinical results and a small pilot study, an open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II-study is conducted to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the investigational antibody FBTA05 in combination with DLI for patients suffering from rituximab- and/or alemtuzumab-refractory, CD20-positive low- or high-grade lymphoma after allogeneic SCT. During the first trial phase with emphasis on dose escalation a maximum of 24 patients distributed into 4 cohorts will be enrolled. For the evaluation of preliminary efficacy data a maximum of 12 patients (6 patients with low-grade lymphoma and/or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / 6 patients with high-grade or aggressive lymphoma) will attend the second phase of this clinical trial. Promising data (e.g. induction of cellular immunity; GVL predominance over GVHD; achievement of partial or complete responses; prolongation of time-to-progression) obtained from this phase I/II trial would represent the first milestone in the clinical evaluation of a novel immunotherapeutic concept for treatment-resistant low- and high-grade lymphoma and NHL patients in relapse. NCT01138579 Approximately half of the patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and the majority of patients with low-grade lymphomas cannot be cured by conventional therapeutic treatment regimes. Intensive chemotherapy followed by stem cell support has improved survival of patients with chemotherapy sensitive lymphoma. The majority of these patients, however, will still relapse, even after high-dose therapy and subsequently have limited therapeutic options. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can induce long-term remission due to a graft versus lymphoma (GVL) reaction, this occurs predominantly in a highly selected population of indolent lymphoma patients. \",\n"," 'A GVL reaction is less pronounced in patients with aggressive lymphoma, resulting in a high relapse rate. In patients not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, palliative treatment is restricted by resistance to chemotherapy and complications of infection. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies with improved anti-tumor efficacy need to be developed for such patients. Immunotherapies with monoclonal antibodies (mABs) directed against the CD20 antigen have previously been shown to be highly effective. Rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and Biogen IDEC Inc, Cambridge, MA), an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) 1 chimeric mAb, induced overall response rates (ORR) up to 50% in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade B cell lymphoma. In first line-treatment, rituximab induces response rates up to 75% in patients with follicular or low-grade NHL. But despite these encouraging results, there are still numerous patients who do not respond or finally relapse. Efforts to further increase the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies resulted in the development of trAb FBTA05 which mediates effective tumor cell cytotoxicity even at low CD20 expression levels, and probably even more importantly, induces a lasting anti-tumor immunity. FBTA05 is a heterologous antibody, composed of two potent heavy chain subclasses, a mouse IgG2a and a rat IgG2b chain, each with their respective light chains. It therefore possesses two specific and one functional binding site. FBTA05 binds with one binding arm to the CD3 antigen on T cells and with the second binding arm to the CD20 antigen, which is expressed exclusively on normal and malignant B cells, but not on hematological precursor cells or other human cell types. In addition, the third functional site within the hybrid Fc region binds to Fcgamma receptor type I, IIa and III which are expressed by accessory cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells) of the immune system. In this \"tri-cell complex\", an important \"crosstalk\" between T cells and accessory cells can occur, which includes co-stimulatory signals necessary for a physiological T cell activation cascade. The simultaneous activation of different immune cells at the tumor site results in efficient killing of tumor cells by several complementary mechanisms (e.g. release of cytokines, perforin-mediated lysis and phagocytosis). The antibody-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells by accessory cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) is believed to result in the processing of tumor antigens and presentation on the surface of these cells. ',\n"," 'result in polyclonal humoral and cellular immune responses, a T cell response even against unknown, tumor-associated peptides may be induced. The combined attack of various immune cells with different killing mechanisms induced by FBTA05 leads to a significant tumor cell elimination when compared to monospecific antibodies or conventional bispecific antibodies. In addition, the induction of a variety of effector mechanisms may result in a protective long-term anti-tumor immunity. The postulated mechanism of action of the trAb FBTA05 is shown in Figure 1. Prior to the start of the current phase I/II dose escalating study, FBTA05 was administered in a compassionate use setting to patients with recurrent and refractory B cell malignancies following allo-SCT, and within a phase I/II trial (IV-A05-LL-01, EudraCT No: 2006-006694-24) to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL in an autologous setting. In compassionate use a limited number of advanced cancer patients were treated with FBTA05. These, included 4 patients with refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), 4 patients with refractory high-grade non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (HG-NHL) and 1 patient with refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). The treatment comprised escalating doses of FBTA05 with a range of 10-2,000 mug per single infusion. The maximum cumulative dosage administered per patient ranged between 130-13,610 mug of FBTA05. The duration of treatment was between 5-76 days. Following FBTA05 treatment, patients received DLI. Due to the nature of the different indications, the number of peripheral B cells prior to the start of FBTA05 infusions showed a large variation. An anti-tumor response (decrease of leukemic cells and shrinking of lymph nodes) was observed in 3 of 4 CLL patients. In 1 case of HG-NHL, a halt of progression for almost 4 months was observed. The effect of FBTA05 in the other patients was not evaluable due to other concomitant treatment or disease (fungal infection). Relapse finally occurred in all patients. The main side effects were restricted to fever, chills, bone pain and transient increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGT). Only one case of GVHD (grade 3) was observed after FBTA05 and DLI and this was in the ALL patient. In context of the administration of the highest cumulative dose of FBTA05 (6,240 mug), a transient granulocytopenia was detected in a HG-NHL patient. The cytokine profile was characterized by a transient increase of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs) were not detectable. ',\n"," 'According to the current experience with the anti HER2/neu directed trAb ertumaxomab there is a correlation between the formation of HAMA and human anti-rat antibodies (HARAs), so HARA development in these patients would seem to be unlikely. Due to the changes in the development program of the sponsor (Fresenius Biotech GmbH) the phase I/II dose escalating study (IV-A05-LL-01, EudraCT No: 2006-006694-24) was prematurely terminated after treatment of 3 patients in the first cohort (maximum dose 100 mug FBTA05). Thus, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) could be established and only limited data on drug safety are available. In general, the intravenous infusion of FBTA05 was assessed to be safe and well tolerated, even at higher antibody doses. However, due to the limited number of patients treated, to variable disease progression in individual patients and to a variety of different concomitant treatments used, this information needs to be interpreted with caution. Antibody based therapies (rituximab, alemtuzumab), especially in combination with chemotherapeutic regimes, offer some advantages in patients with CLL and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Nevertheless, most patients finally relapse. Especially patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have a very poor prognosis in case of early relapse after chemotherapy combined with rituximab. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further develop alternative treatment options whereby the CD20 antigen represents a solid target for innovative therapeutic approaches: (i) it is expressed on most B-cell lymphomas, (ii) it is only expressed on B cells, but not precursor cells or human tissues and (iii) it is not shed or secreted upon antibody binding. The trAb FBTA05 provides a novel and unique approach for the targeted treatment of CD20 expressing neoplasias. The potency of FBTA05 has been demonstrated by efficient in vitro killing of human B cell tumor cells, as well as cells derived from CLL patients expressing only low levels of CD20. FBTA05 in combination with DLI has already been administered to patients in compassionate use prior to the start of the scheduled phase I/II study and assessed to be feasible, safe and well tolerated even at high antibody and T cell doses. Most importantly, some anti-tumor responses were observed in 3 CLL and 1 NHL patient. It is well established that DLI, given as a single treatment is effective in hematological relapse post-SCT, but it is suggested that concerted treatment with additional drugs may further improve treatment outcome. ',\n"," 'Thus, the combination of DLI and the anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trAb FBTA05 might be a promising treatment option for patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allo-SCT. Since both, the desired GVL and the unwanted detrimental GVHD responses are mediated by T lymphocytes present in DLI preparations, FBTA05 has the capacity to enhance these GVL effects as autologous and allogeneic T cells are targeted to tumor sites. At the same time as GVL of allogeneic T lymphocytes is strengthened by FBTA05 engagement the risks for GVHD development are reduced. Therefore, by adding FBTA05 to the established allogeneic DLI treatment regime patients may even benefit more from this combined therapeutic approach. Furthermore, FBTA05 should be given prior to DLI administration to allow the already bound anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trAbs FBTA05 to attract incoming allogeneic T lymphocytes directly to the CD20-expressing tumor cells. In other words, this treatment setting may favor GVL enhancement by simultaneously minimizing GVHD risks. This application sequence may be also important to control cytokine release due the increased number of CD3+ T target cells of FBTA05 in the blood circulation after DLI infusion. The opposite application order for FBTA05 and DLI would not mediate this positive effect of pre-coating tumor cells with trAb FBTA05 in vivo for attracting incoming allogeneic T lymphocytes. Moreover, preclinical and first clinical data confirmed this beneficial sequence for FBTA05 and DLI application. The present trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational trAb FBTA05 in combination with DLI for treatment of relapsed or refractory disease in CD20 positive CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL after allogeneic transplantation. The primary objective is the determination of the MTD of FBTA05 in phase I (dose-escalation part). In phase II (efficacy part), it is the preliminary evaluation of efficacy of a treatment schedule with FBTA05 and DLI in patients with CD20 positive either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL after allo-SCT. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of safety and pharmacodynamics of FBTA05 in combination with DLI, the induction of cellular immunity in terms of GVL or GVHD, and the determination of further efficacy data in terms of time to progression (TTP), duration of response and clinical benefit. The primary endpoint in Phase I is the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), in phase II the objective response rate. ',\n"," 'The secondary endpoints are safety and efficacy. Regarding safety, the recommended dose of FBTA05 in combination with DLI for further efficacy studies will be determined. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), the presence of HAMAs after FBTA05 application, the need to discontinue FBTA05 infusion, vital functions, the physical examination findings, laboratory parameters, concomitant medication and as pharmacodynamic endpoints the serum levels of cytokines will be recorded. In terms of efficacy the clinical benefit rate, the duration of response, the time to progression, the overall survival, the ECOG performance status, the tumor specific response, lymphocyte subsets, activation signs and memory status of T cells will be analysed. To evaluate differences in drug response to CLL/low grade NHL or high grade NHL, patients are enrolled into study cohorts according to their respective disease entity (either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL). As shown in Figure 2, the complete treatment course consists of a drug induction part (safety part) with defined FBTA05 doses of 10 mug on day 0, 20 mug on day 3 and 50 mug on day 7, as well as a drug maintenance / escalation part (course I and II, see also Table 1). The final antibody infusion of each part is followed by a dose-escalated application of donor lymphocytes. Each cohort includes at least 2 patients. In a strict sequential order, treatment and dose escalation (cohort A-D, Table 1) is performed independently for each disease entity (either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL). Thus, treatment of any subsequent patient 2 or 3 at a certain dose level will be started only after the safety part treatment of the previous patient of the same disease entity is completed, and the External Safety Board (ESB), acting as a Dose Steering Board (DSB), agrees to the enrolment of the next patient. The same dose escalation procedure will be applied throughout the study for all Cohorts (A-D). If one dose-limiting toxicity is seen, a total of 3 patients of the same disease entity must be treated at that dose level. If two dose-limiting toxicities are seen at any dose level, treatment for this disease entity is terminated and the MTD will be established at the next lower dosing level. If 2 of 3 patients of the same disease entity in Cohort A show dose-limiting toxicities, the MTD has been reached and lower dose levels may have to be investigated. ',\n"," 'After the phase I part of the study an interim analysis will be performed. Based on the outcome of this analysis the recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part will be proposed by the ESB and the investigators on the basis of the MTD and any other relevant safety issues. The recommended dose will not exceed the maximal dose foreseen in the protocol approved by the competent authority. The report of the interim analysis with the recommended dose will be presented to the ethics committee and competent authority. A maximum of 6 patients per disease entity will receive treatment during phase II. If the last Cohort at MTD level in phase I already included 2 or 3 patients for CLL/low grade NHL, respectively high-grade NHL, an additional 4 or 3 patients per disease entity will be enrolled in phase II. There will be a maximum of 24 patients in the MTD evaluation part of phase I: 12 patients for CLL / low-grade NHL, 12 patients for high-grade NHL. There will be a maximum of 12 patients in phase II of the study: 6 patients for CLL / low-grade NHL, 6 patients for HG-NHL. A total of maximal 30 patients will be included in the study. Patients of both genders, any ethnic origin and at least 18 years old are included in the study if they meet the criteria given in Table 2. All participating patients have to sign the written informed consent. Patients can be withdrawn from the study for medical reasons at any time and must be withdrawn in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity. Patients can recall their consent at any time without any negative implications for their further treatment. The investigational drug FBTA05 is provided by the TRION Pharma GmbH (Munich, Germany) as a sterile, pyrogen-free, color-free and preservative-free solution for infusion. The concentrate contains 0.2 mg/ml antibody per 100mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6), with 0.02% Tween 80. Depending on the dose level, FBTA05 is further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution for i.v. infusion. FBTA05 is administered with a constant rate over 6 hours by intravenous (i.v.) infusion. To avoid infusion reactions typically occurring after i.v. antibody infusions, i.v. Paracetamol (1,000 mg) and i.v. Dimetinden (4 mg) are administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of infusion. Three hours after the start of FBTA05 infusion, i.v. Paracetamol (500 - 1,000 mg) is repeated. ',\n"," 'Post-infusion, Paracetamol and Dimetinden are administered, as needed. In phase I, each patient (cohort A - D) will undergo the same safety part and receive induction doses of FBTA05 on day 0 (10 mug), day 3 (20 mug) and day 7 (50 mug). During the maintenance part, FBTA05 applications are scheduled for course I on day 14 (+- 1 day), 21 (+- 1 day), 28 (+- 1 day) and 35 (+- 1 day), for course II on day 42 (+- 1 day), 49(+- 1 day), 56 (+- 1 day) and 63 (+- 1 day). Thereby dose escalation of FBTA05 will be performed according to the respective Cohort A - D (Table 1). Donor lymphocyte infusion is scheduled in each cohort at the end of the safety part (day 7), as well as at the end of course I (day 35) and course II (day 63). The numbers of infused T cells are escalated according to the respective preparative regimen applied for allo-SCT as shown in Table 3. DLI will not be performed in case the of GVHD or active infection at the time of DLI, or in the rare cases that DLI is not available for technical reasons. In this case antibody application will be continued as scheduled without DLI. In phase II the recommended dose will be applied according to the respective treatment schedule as determined in phase I. Patients are required to complete screening procedures and 14 treatment visits (11 applications of FBTA05; 3 applications of DLI), so far as the dosage regimen is tolerated according to MTD assessments. Two weeks after the last infusion (week 12), patients will attend an end-of-study visit (EOS). In follow up, patients will attend 4 additional post-study follow-up visits (6, 9, 12 and 24 months after start of treatment). Patients enrolled in phase II will follow the identical screening, treatment and post-study follow-up schedule as for phase I. An ESB, composed of three independent experienced clinical experts is responsible for the evaluation of the patients. Together with the investigators they decide, whether individual patients may continue the study, and whether or not dose escalation can be applied. The ESB is involved in the assessment and declaration of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) as well as the evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). ',\n"," 'Moreover, based on the results of the interim analysis at the end of the phase I, the ESB together with the investigators will propose the recommended dose (RD) for phase II. The condition for a DLT is fulfilled in the case of termination of treatment due to an adverse reaction. Thereby, the treatment schedule for a patient must be terminated if any toxicity grade >= 3, condition or adverse event (e.g. body temperature >= Grade 3 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) (40 C), systolic BP < 75 or > 210 mm Hg, pulse < 50 or > 150 bpm or a dyspnoea grade IV) does not normalize within 3 hours. Furthermore, treatment will be terminated in case of an anaphylactic reaction, including, but not limited to severe angioedema, severe bronchospasm, severe urticaria or anaphylactic shock which occurs during the infusion. An adverse reaction, including clinical conditions of CTC Grade >= 3 or clinically relevant laboratory abnormality of CTC Grade >= 3 which occurs after the infusion and does not resolve until the planned date of the next infusion will also be grounds for termination of treatment. To assure the safety of the study patients a substantial examination program is performed. The patients are under hospital surveillance at least 1 hour prior to infusion and for 24 hours after the start of infusion. Physical examinations are performed at all scheduled visits and vital parameters (e.g. blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen-saturation and body temperature) are monitored throughout the infusion time until 24 hours after start of infusion. Moreover, patients are evaluated with regard to clinical signs, symptoms (including AEs) and subjective well-being. Laboratory parameters for safety analysis and immune monitoring are evaluated at every study visit. Moreover, during treatment, blood will be drawn prior to the start of infusion, at the end of the 6-hour drug infusion period and at 24 after the start of infusion. Blood chemistry parameters include sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, bilirubin (total), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, or SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, or SGPT) gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphastase, antithrombin III, albumin, creatinine, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), quick prothrombin time, fibrinogen and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Hematology parameters encompass hematocrit, hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, reticulocytes, platelets and differential WBC. ',\n"," 'An extensive immune monitoring program determines lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8 T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes) including effector, central memory as well as regulatory T cells and cytokine release profiles comprising interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Experimental ELISPOT-analysis to evaluate the induction of tumor specific immune responses after treatment with FBTA05 is restricted to CLL samples. Bone marrow biopsies are done before the start of treatment, moreover at the EOS and, 12 and 24 months after the start of therapy. Disseminated tumor cells will be determined by analyzing bone marrow aspirates taken from the iliac crest. Changes in the presence of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow will be assessed according to NCI criteria. Tumor assessment via imaging techniques (sonography, compute tomography, magnetic resonance tomography or positron-emission tomography) is clinical practise for the advanced stage of disease and will be performed at the screening, end of study visit and follow up visits scheduled 6, 9, 12 and 24 month after onset of the study. Assessment will be done according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The study is exploratory and is not powered to address any predefined hypotheses. The safety analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least one FBTA05 infusion. The efficacy analysis will be performed on both the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least the first three infusions and the first DLI (safety part). Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by use of appropriate descriptive techniques. The FBTA05 trial is supported by the Bavarian Immunotherapy Network (BayImmuNet) and the Munich m4-Biotech Cluster.

',\n"," 'Before start of the trial, the trial protocol, informed consent document and any other trial documents were submitted to the independent ethics committee and the regulatory authority (Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, PEI). Ethics approval was granted on 14 January 2010, PEI approval on 16 July 2010. The trial protocol was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov and was given the number NCT01138579. The procedures set out in this trial protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation and documentation of this trial, are designed to ensure that all persons involved in the trial abide by Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles described in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial will be carried out in keeping with local legal and regulatory requirements. The idea to redirect immunity via bispecific antibodies is currently one of the most compelling concepts in cancer treatment. In the meantime, various bispecific antibody formats have entered clinical trials indicating their enormous therapeutic potential. In the present phase I/II trial, the anti-CD3 x anti-CD20 trAb FBTA05 is applied in combination with DLI in patients with CD20-positive CLL, low- and high-grade NHL relapsed or refractory after allo-SCT. The primary goal of this combined FBTA05/DLI treatment approach is to further improve an already successful allogeneic DLI regime for patients with resistant B cell malignancies who relapsed after allo-SCT. In addition, Riechelmann and co-workers showed that opsonization of autologous effector cells (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells) with anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 trAb catumaxomab led to beneficial results (i.e. tolerability, safety and response) in patients with intractable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Based on these findings and anticipating our own preliminary clinical data from a small pilot study, the planned treatment schedule is designed to enhance the targeting of tumor cells by allogeneic T lymphocytes while reducing the risk of undesirable GVHD reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD as already shown in preclinical models. Of note, these studies about the enhancement of graft-versus-tumor effects and the reduction of GVHD by means of combined DLI/trAb application was thoroughly performed upon administration of C57 splenocytes with or without pretreatment of anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 trAb BiLu in (BALB x C57BL/6) F1 H-2d/b mice that were previously inoculated with a lethal dose of B16-EpCAM melanoma cells. Importantly, the C57 spleen cells were syngeneic to the B16-EpCAM tumor cells, but haploidentically mismatched to host cells. ',\n"," 'Treatment with BiLu protected recipient mice from the alloreactive C57 splenocytes, as GVHD-related death was observed in only 20% of mice whereas almost all mice inoculated with naive C57 splenocytes w/o BiLu pretreatment died of GVHD. In total 50% of all treated mice were disease-free in this experimental settings. BiLu treatment w/o cell therapy also had a substantial anti-tumor effect, as a similar proportion of treated mice were disease-free under these conditions. Thus, future trials could also address the feasibility to pass on DLI in relevant clinical settings. Here, this clinical study with a combined trAb/DLI treatment might provide further insights into the capacity of this therapeutic regime to deplete malignant B cells, activate the immune system and induce secondary cell-mediated immunity.

',\n"," \"The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in few durable remissions. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01105247.) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. Therapy for symptomatic CLL has consisted predominantly of chemotherapeutic agents, including chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and combinations of these agents that are effective for palliation but do not improve survival. The addition of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to chemotherapy (fludarabine alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide) results in higher response rates, extended remissions, and improved overall survival. However, a subgroup of patients with deletion of 17p13.1 have a poor response to chemoimmunotherapy, and patients with tumors expressing unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain genes have shorter remissions than those with mutated genes. Furthermore, chemoimmunotherapy is not curative, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased toxicity and reduced antitumor activity. Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, CLL lacks a common genetic target. However, B-cell-receptor signaling has emerged as a driving factor for CLL tumor-cell survival. \",\n"," \"Downstream of the B-cell receptor and of critical importance to its function is a member of the Tec family of kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK mutations in humans cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which leads to the absence of peripheral-blood B cells, decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin, and increased susceptibility to infections. BTK is essential for activation of several constitutively active pathways of CLL-cell survival, including the Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathways. In addition, BTK is essential to chemokine-mediated homing and adhesion of B cells. Given the importance of B-cell-receptor signaling in CLL and the central role of BTK in this pathway, an attractive strategy is to target inhibition of this kinase. Ibrutinib (Pharmacyclics) is an orally bioavailable, potent inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.5 nM) that covalently binds to the cysteine-481 amino acid of the BTK enzyme. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib treatment inhibits numerous processes, including ERK signaling, NF-kappaB DNA binding, cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-mediated CLL-cell proliferation, and tumor-cell migration. Ibrutinib does not have toxic effects on normal T cells; this distinguishes it from most regimens used for CLL. A phase 1 study of ibrutinib showed mild-to-moderate toxicity and clinical antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell cancers; 11 of the 16 patients in the study had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. These preliminary results prompted the initiation of a phase 1b-2 study of ibrutinib in CLL; this study involved two different therapeutic doses in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Eligibility criteria included the following: a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as defined according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and World Health Organization classifications; a need for treatment; adequate renal and hepatic function, defined by a creatinine level of no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and an alanine aminotransferase level of no more than 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range; and an absence of active infection. The first and second cohorts were required to have received at least two previous therapies, including a purine analogue. A third cohort was composed of patients with high-risk disease that did not respond to a chemoimmunotherapy regimen or that progressed within 24 months after completion of the regimen. \",\n"," 'neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter were required initially. However, an amendment to the protocol allowed enrollment of 22 patients with any degree of cytopenia if it was due to bone marrow involvement. Exclusion criteria were any type of cancer that limited survival to less than 2 years, gastrointestinal disease that might inhibit ibrutinib absorption, and medicines associated with torsades de pointes. Testing to detect interphase cytogenetic abnormalities, immunoglobulin-gene mutational analysis, and measurement of beta2-microglobulin levels were performed during the screening period by a central reference laboratory. This phase 1b-2, open-label, multicenter study was designed to determine the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. In addition, we sought to examine the influence of features of a poor prognosis on the clinical response to ibrutinib. An institutional review board approved the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) at each study site. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent. The study is ongoing. Two cohorts of patients (27 patients in cohort 1 and 24 patients in cohort 3) were assigned to receive a fixed daily dose of 420 mg of ibrutinib, and one cohort (34 patients in cohort 2) was assigned to receive a daily dose of 840 mg, with both doses administered orally on a continuous schedule until the onset of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment in the three cohorts occurred consecutively from May 2010 through August 2011. On the basis of early data from cohort 1, cohort 3 was added to study the effect of 420 mg in patients with high-risk disease. The primary end point was the safety of the two fixed-dose regimens, assessed according to the frequency and severity of adverse events. Safety monitoring, which included a clinical history taking, physical examination, and laboratory tests, was performed weekly for the first month, every other week for the second month, and monthly thereafter. Adverse events were graded with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf). Hematologic toxic effects were graded according to the system of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (2008). ',\n"," \"The secondary end points were the overall response rate, progression-free survival, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. A response assessment that included a radiologic examination was performed at the end of cycles 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 24. A bone marrow biopsy was performed to confirm a complete response. The response in patients with CLL was evaluated according to the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with the exception that lymphocytosis was not the sole criterion for disease progression (a summary of the response criteria is available in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). For patients with persistent lymphocytosis, a partial response in all other measures was characterized as a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response in patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma was evaluated according to the International Working Group criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2007). Putative biomarkers of response and overall survival were exploratory end points. We conducted pharmacokinetic studies to determine the exposure to ibrutinib after treatment at both dose levels. The pharmacokinetic measures were derived from the nominal plasma concentration-time curves. Pharmacodynamic testing was performed to assess the level of drug binding to BTK (BTK occupancy) after treatment. A cell-permeable, fluorescently tagged derivative of ibrutinib was used to visualize BTK before treatment and 4 and 24 hours after treatment, as previously described. The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics and Janssen. All the authors and the sponsors were responsible for designing the study protocol and analysis plan. All the authors and their respective research teams collected all the data, and the sponsors confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled it for summation and analysis. The authors had full access to the data and analyses for compilation of this report. Manuscript drafts were prepared by the authors with editorial assistance from a professional medical writer paid by Janssen. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of the study to the protocol, and all the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for discrete variables, were used to summarize the findings in each of the defined cohorts. All analyses included patients who received the study drug. The overall response rate with a 95% confidence interval was calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for time-to-event analysis (curves and corresponding quartiles). \",\n"," \"Data on progression-free survival were censored when patients received new anticancer therapy or at the last clinical assessment, for patients who were lost to follow-up. No imputation of missing values was performed. In an exploratory analysis, characteristics associated with response and progression-free survival and overall survival were compared by means of Fisher's exact test in each subgroup. Analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. A total of 85 patients were enrolled at eight sites. The baseline characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1, and in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. The patients, who were generally considered to have high-risk disease, had received a median of four previous therapies. A total of 65% of the patients had advanced-stage disease, 33% had 17p13.1 deletions, and 36% had 11q22.3 deletions. At a median follow-up of 20.9 months (range, 0.7 to 26.7), 54 patients (64%) were still receiving treatment, and 31 (36%) had discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation (detailed in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix) included disease progression in 11 patients (13%); the patient's or investigator's decision in 13 (15%), of whom 5 patients then underwent stem-cell transplantation; and adverse events in 7 patients (8%), including 3 patients who had pneumonia, 2 who had sepsis, 1 who had staphylococcal bacteremia without physiological signs of sepsis, and 1 who had gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The steady-state concentration-time profiles of ibrutinib after administration of 420 mg or 840 mg per day are shown in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The exposure to ibrutinib increased proportionally from a dose of 420 to 840 mg per day. No differences in the time to the peak ibrutinib concentration in the blood (median Tmax, 2 hours [range, 0.5 to 6]) or the terminal half-life (7.8+-3.6 hours with 420 mg per day and 8.1+-3.4 hours with 840 mg per day) were apparent between doses. Post-treatment assessments indicated full occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib at both dose levels. The median level of BTK occupancy was 96 to 99% (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix); it was observed as early as 4 hours after the dose was administered and was maintained 24 hours after the dose was administered, at both dose levels. Long-term therapy with ibrutinib was associated with modest toxicity; most adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 2). \",\n"," 'The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection, and most adverse events resolved without the need for a suspension of treatment. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2 patients in the 420-mg cohort (4%) and in 4 patients in the 840-mg cohort (12%). Serious adverse events are listed in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were pneumonia (in 10 patients [12%]) and dehydration (in 5 patients [6%]). Infections of grade 3 or higher occurred most frequently early in the course of therapy. The average rate of infection was 7.1 per 100 patient-months during the first 6 months and 2.6 per 100 patient-months thereafter (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The exposure-adjusted rate of infections that were grade 3 or higher was reduced by more than half after 6 months of treatment (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). IgG and IgM levels remained relatively stable throughout treatment, whereas IgA levels increased at 3, 6, and 12 months (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects were infrequent; 5 patients (6%) had anemia, 13 patients (15%) had neutropenia, and 5 patients (6%) had thrombocytopenia. Bleeding events that were grade 3 or higher in severity occurred in 4 patients. A total of 8 patients died within 30 days after receiving the last dose of ibrutinib: 3 deaths were from pneumonia, 1 was from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 1 was from sarcoma, and 3 were related to CLL progression. The overall response rate based on the standard criteria was 71% (2 complete responses and 34 partial responses) in the 420-mg cohort and 71% (24 partial responses) in the 840-mg cohort. In addition, 10 patients in the 420-mg cohort (20%) and 5 patients in the 840-mg cohort (15%) had a partial response with persistent lymphocytosis. Blood lymphocytosis was generally noted by day 7 (in 78% of the patients); it peaked at a median of 4 weeks and then slowly declined. In 50 of 63 patients (79%), the lymphocyte count normalized (absolute lymphocyte count, <4x109 cells per cubic millimeter) or was reduced by 50% from the baseline level. Treatment-related lymphocytosis developed at similar frequencies in patients with unmutated and those with mutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain genes (77% and 83%, respectively). ',\n"," \"However, in patients with unmutated immunoglobulin genes, lymphocyte counts normalized more rapidly (median, 6.4 vs. 14.8 months) and more frequently (in 85% vs. 50% of the patients). Lymphocytosis occurred concomitantly with a notable reduction in lymph-node size (Fig. 1A) and spleen size, as well as frequent improvement in cytopenias (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). An improved response was time-dependent (Fig. 1B); increasing numbers of partial responses and complete responses occurred during follow-up, whereas the frequency of a partial response with lymphocytosis diminished as the lymphocyte count decreased over time. As shown in Figure 2, the response to ibrutinib did not appear to vary according to traditional high-risk prognostic features. The response rate among the patients with a 17p13.1 deletion was 68%, including one complete response, whereas the response rate was 71% among those without this deletion. The only factor associated with a response was the mutation status of the immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene. Notably, 4 of the 12 patients with a mutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene (33%) had a partial response or complete response and 5 (42%) had a partial response with lymphocytosis. By contrast, 53 of the 69 patients with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene (77%) had a partial response or complete response and 9 (13%) had a partial response with lymphocytosis. This difference in the overall response rate (partial response plus complete response) was significant (P = 0.005), whereas the combined overall response rate plus the rate of partial response with lymphocytosis did not differ significantly according to mutation status. Sustained improvement in cytopenias, defined as improvement by more than 50% or a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g per deciliter, an absolute neutrophil count higher than 1500 cells per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count higher than 100,000 cells per cubic millimeter (lasting for >=2 cycles without transfusion or administration of growth factors), was frequently observed during ibrutinib treatment (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Improvement was observed in 32 of 41 patients with baseline thrombocytopenia (78%), 27 of 33 with anemia (82%), and 24 of 31 with neutropenia (77%). Ibrutinib treatment promoted durable responses, irrespective of the dose. The 26-month estimated rate of progression-free survival (Fig. 3A, top graph) was 75%, and the rate of overall survival (Fig. 3B, top graph) was 83%. Disease progression developed in 11 patients (13%) during follow-up, and 7 of those patients had progression by biologic transformation (Richter's syndrome). \",\n"," 'The median time from the initial diagnosis of CLL to transformation was 98 months (range, 24 to 143). Among the 11 patients in whom progressive disease developed, 10 patients had a 17p13.1 or a 11q22.3 deletion, and 1 patient did not have high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (Fig. 3A). Patients had a prolonged time to progression despite high-risk genomic features. Among the 28 patients with a 17p13.1 deletion : a uniformly poor prognostic factor : the 26-month estimated rate of progression-free survival (Fig. 3A) was 57% and the rate of overall survival (Fig. 3B) was 70%. Patients who discontinued ibrutinib for reasons other than progression remained in the study and were followed quarterly until disease progression, the initiation of new anticancer therapy, or death. After disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, follow-up was limited to survival status. Treatment at the time of new treatment initiation was left to the discretion of the treating physician. The responses to ibrutinib, the covalent inhibitor of BTK, that we observed in this study were more durable than expected on the basis of previous experience with other single-agent therapies for relapsed CLL. At both doses of ibrutinib that we studied, pharmacokinetic data showed rapid absorption and elimination. Moreover, pharmacodynamic data showed that once-daily ibrutinib provided effective and complete occupancy of BTK, a surrogate of kinase inhibition. Ibrutinib caused a transient increase in blood lymphocyte levels, which was concurrent with a reduction in lymph-node size, spleen size, or both. Continued treatment with ibrutinib led to resolution of this asymptomatic lymphocytosis, and patients were characterized as having a classic response according to the 2008 criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with an observed response rate of 71%. Fifteen additional patients (18%) in this study had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Treatment-related lymphocytosis has been seen with other agents that target B-cell-receptor signaling; these findings have prompted several groups of CLL experts to conclude that such lymphocytosis is not a sign of progressive disease. Our findings provide support for an ibrutinib-mediated pharmacodynamic effect on CLL by cell mobilization from protected bone marrow, lymphnode, and spleen sites harboring stromal elements that have been shown to promote leukemic-cell proliferation, drug resistance, and survival. ',\n"," \"Despite the immunocompromised condition of the patients, who had received a median of four previous therapies, ibrutinib treatment did not result in an increased incidence of grade 3 or higher infections during the extended therapy period, as compared with the rates reported in several series of patients who received traditional salvage therapies. The incidence of infection was highest early in the course of ibrutinib treatment and decreased with continued therapy. During treatment, improvement in neutrophil counts occurred in patients with baseline neutropenia (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix), with significant increases in the level of serum IgA and no detrimental effects on IgG or IgM levels (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The analysis of immunoglobulin levels was limited to patients with relatively preserved immunoglobulin levels, since those who received intravenous immune globulin were excluded. The occurrence of ecchymosis, petechiae, or both was noted on the skin in a subgroup of patients who received ibrutinib, but these conditions were not accompanied by excess bleeding or associated with thrombocytopenia. Randomized trials comparing the safety profile of ibrutinib with that of other therapeutic agents for CLL are ongoing. These trials include A Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) Versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707) and A Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor PCI-32765 Versus Chlorambucil in Patients 65 Years or Older with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE-2, NCT01722487). Several validated high-risk characteristics of CLL, including 17p13.1 deletion, did not influence the objective response to ibrutinib. However, most events associated with disease progression occurred in patients with high-risk cytogenetic lesions (17p13.1 deletion or 11q22.3 deletion), whereas only one patient without these risk factors had an event associated with disease progression. Patients with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene, perhaps owing to enhanced B-cell-receptor signaling and dependence on this pathway, had earlier resolution of lymphocytosis and were more frequently classified as having a response according to traditional response criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (P = 0.02); however, survival outcomes were similar to those among patients without this unmutated gene. Greater than 90% occupancy of the pharmacodynamic probe and the similar response in the two dose groups provide support for the use of the 420-mg dose of ibrutinib for relapsed CLL. \",\n"," 'Ibrutinib has a favorable therapeutic index, which may facilitate its use in combination with other agents for the treatment of CLL. However, the durable remissions obtained thus far suggest that many patients may be treated successfully with monotherapy. ',\n"," 'Forodesine was originally developed for T-cell leukemias and was effective in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The current study was done to test its utility in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Our preclinical investigations (lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with B-ALL [n=12]) demonstrate activity in vitro. Minimal activity in the clinic suggests that this agent should be used in combination with other established or novel ALL agents. The discovery that purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency leads to T-cell lymphopenia was the basis for introducing PNP inhibitors for T-cell leukemias. Forodesine is an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor with picomolar potency. Because T lymphoblasts and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics to accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), forodesine demonstrated promising activity in preclinical and clinical settings for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell CLL (B-CLL). However, the use of forodesine in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is unknown. Leukemic blasts obtained from pediatric patients with de novo B-ALL (n=10) were incubated with forodesine and deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and the biological end points of apoptosis, intracellular dGTP accumulation, and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis were measured. Additionally, adult patients with B-ALL (n= 2) were intravenously infused with 80 mg/m2/d daily for 5 days. After therapy, clinical response, toxicity, laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition, and plasma forodesine, dGuo, and intracellular dGTP levels were analyzed. Our in vitro investigations demonstrated that forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation and induced modest apoptosis in de novo B-ALL lymphoblasts. There was time-dependent accumulation of dGTP and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. During therapy, neither patient achieved a complete response (CR), but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. There was significant maintained inhibition of PNP enzyme in red blood cells, accumulation of forodesine and dGuo in plasma, and intracellular dGTP accumulation in both patients. Our preclinical and clinical investigations suggest that forodesine has activity in B-ALL. However, it needs to be either infused with dGuo or combined with established chemotherapeutic agents based on mechanistic rationale. The discovery of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, a metabolic disorder that results in congenital immunodeficiency in association with severe T-cell immune depletion, and the elucidation of its pathophysiologic characteristics provided the rationale for the development of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) analogs for leukemias. Because dGuo is readily catabolized by PNP, phar-macologic inhibition of this enzyme manifests a deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP)-mediated T-cell lymphopenia. ',\n"," 'Although T-cell-specific depletion was observed with dGuo, the efficient catabolism of dGuo by PNP limited its use clinically. Taken together, these data provided a rationale for the development of PNP-resistant dGuo analogs or PNP inhibitors for the treatment of leukemias. The PNP-resistant dGuo derivative arabinosylguanine (ara-G) is toxic to T lymphoblasts and resistant to degradation by endogenous PNP. Once within cells, ara-G is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase into ara-GTP. The resultant accumulation of intracellular ara-GTP inhibits DNA synthesis. Similar to dGuo, ara-G has shown antileukemic activity in T-lymphoblastic cell lines and in the clinic through a T-lymphoid lineage-specific accumulation of ara-GTP during therapy. A clinical trial conducted by the Childrens Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group of nelarabine, a prodrug of ara-G, in refractory T-cell leukemias and lymphomas demonstrated higher responses in T-ALL. Additionally, a phase II trial in patients with refractory T-cell malignancies demonstrated substantial single-agent activity, with an objective response rate of more than 50% in the subset of patients with T-cell leukemia. Of note, some activity was also seen in patients with B-lineage disease. Forodesine (also known as BCX-1777/immucillin H) was developed as an orally bioavailable novel PNP transition-state inhibitor with a low picomolar inhibitory constant for human enzymes. The principal requisite for this agent to demonstrate its action relies on complete inhibition (> 95%) of the PNP enzyme and subsequent accumulation of dGTP, the intracellular metabolite of substrate dGuo. Forodesine exhibited cytotoxicity in T-cell leukemia cell lines through accumulation of large amounts of intracellular dGTP perturbing the cellular milieu. This in vitro activity in cell lines provided the impetus to initiate a clinical study in patients with T-cell leukemia to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this inhibitor. In agreement with its preclinical activity, forodesine demonstrated promising activity in patients with T-cell leukemia through accumulation of dGuo in plasma and dGTP in leukemia cells. Forodesine is also effective against indolent B- and T-cell diseases (both in vitro and in clinical trials), as well as in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. With this background, we proposed to test forodesine in B-ALL based on the following rationale. First, akin to T cells, inhibition of PNP promotes accumulation of dGTP, subsequent imbalance in the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and eventually cell death in B cells. Second, T-cell therapies such as nelarabine have demonstrated clinical activity in B-cell leukemias. ',\n"," 'have demonstrated clinical activity in B-cell leukemias. Third, B cells have high levels of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the enzyme that facilitates the accumulation of dGTP. Fourth, the rate-limiting enzyme dCK that converts dGuo to dGTP is present in high levels in pediatric lymphoblasts. Finally, forodesine has demonstrated some activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of forodesine in B-ALL. Given that B cells contain high levels of dCK, we hypothesized that this agent could sensitize B-ALL lymphoblasts to apoptosis. Our preclinical studies with 12 pediatric patients with de novo acute leukemia (most had B-ALL [10 patients] with 1 each T-ALL and acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) and extended studies on clinical evaluation of adult patients with B-ALL (n = 2) provide the rationale for utility of this agent in B-cell leukemias. Forodesine for clinical use was provided by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL). For quantitation of deoxynucleotides, dNTPs were obtained from Amersham/GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Pittsburgh, PA) and were used as standards. [3H]deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and [3H]deoxythymidine triphosphate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham, MA) and MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA), respectively. This project consists of reports from 2 studies: in vitro investigations in blasts from de novo pediatric acute leukemia with forodesine (n=12) and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluations of forodesine in adult patients with B-ALL (n=2) during therapy. Among pediatric patients, the majority were patients with active B-ALL (B-ALL [n=10]; acute myelogenous leukemia [AML] [n=1]; acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL] [n=1]). Whole blood or bone marrow was collected in heparinized tubes from pediatric patients with leukemia at initial diagnosis. The specimen was diluted 1:3 with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.135 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4 [pH 7.4]) and layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque (specific gravity, 1.086; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The blood was then centrifuged at 433g for 20 minutes, and mononuclear cells were removed from the interphase. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 10 mL RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The isolated lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo in a culture incubator at 37 C. These concentrations were selected based on plasma pharmacologic data obtained during a phase I study of forodesine. ',\n"," \"Cultures were maintained and aliquots (1x107 cells/mL) were removed at the end of incubation times. A Coulter channelyzer (Coulter Electronics) was used to determine cell number and mean cell volume. These cells were measured for intracellular dNTP, macromolecule syntheses, and apoptosis levels. The lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo. Cultures were maintained and aliquots (1x107 cells/mL) were removed at the end of incubation times (24 or 48 hours). Percent apoptosis was measured by annexin V binding assay (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, fresh cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 microL of 1xannexin binding buffer obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), at a concentration of 1x10 cells/mL. Annexin V:fluorescein isothiocyanate (5 microL) was added, and the cells were incubated in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature. Ten microliters (50 microg/mL) propidium iodide was then added to the labeled cells and analyzed immediately with a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data from at least 10,000 events per sample were recorded and processed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). The lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo for indicated time points (24 or 48 hours), and the global DNA and RNA syntheses were measured by [3H] thymidine and [3H]uridine incorporation assays. Before removal of the aliquot, 10 microCi/mL [3H]thymidine or [3H]uridine was added to these cultures, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 minutes. The labeled cells were then extracted using perchloric acid, and the pellets were incubated overnight with KOH at 37 C to dissolve DNA and RNA, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). PNP inhibition was measured by spectrophotometric assay. Erythrocytes were separated from whole blood and PNP was extracted from red blood cells by cell hemolysis. Addition of the substrate inosine results in conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine by PNP. Hypoxanthine is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase to form a stable product, uric acid. The accumulation of uric acid is quantitatively determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 293 nm. The observed data are then normalized by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm, which represents the number of erythrocytes used to prepare the PNP extract. \",\n"," 'The inhibitory effect was calculated using the equation [1 :(PNP activity post dose/PNP activity pre dose)] x 100. Blood samples (10 mL) before and after treatment at indicated days were obtained in green-stopper Vacutainer tubes containing heparin and 50 microM BCX-3424 (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals) as an internal control. The plasma was removed after centrifugation and stored at :70 C and analyzed at BioCryst Pharmaceuticals. Plasma dGuo and forodesine were analyzed as described previously using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Briefly, BCX-1777 was extracted from plasma using a phenylboronic acid affinity solid-phase extraction cartridge and dGuo was extracted from plasma using a Waters Oasis HLB affinity solid-phase extraction cartridge (Waters Corp, Milford, MA). The mass of BCX-1777 plus H+ (267.1 m/z) and the mass of dGuo plus H+ (268.1 m/z) are monitored in quadrupole 1. The BCX-1777 product ion 148.0 m/z and the dGuo product ion 157.0 m/z are monitored in quadrupole 3. The concentrations of forodesine and dGuo were determined by weighted (1/x) quadratic regression analysis of peak areas produced from the standard curve. Cells incubated in vitro with dGuo and forodesine were collected at different time points (24 or 48 hours at 37 C). Similarly, blood samples were obtained from patients at different time points during treatment with forodesine, and leukemic blasts were isolated. The nucleotides in the blast cells were extracted by 60% methanol as described previously, and the dNTPs were quantitated in these cell extracts by DNA polymerase assay as described by Sherman and Fyfe. Patients were eligible to participate if they had failed at least 1 previous treatment regimen for B-ALL. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or better, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, adequate organ function with aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels micro<=3 times the upper limit of normal, and calculated creatinine clearance > 40 mL/min. Female patients had to have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 to 7 days before the start of the study, and all patients had to be free of active or uncontrolled infection, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis viruses. Patients signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center before participation in the study. ',\n"," 'Blood samples were collected on the pretreatment day and on days 1 through 4 on cycles 1 to 3, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined. The clinical trial was a phase I/II open-label multicenter study of forodesine hydrochloride in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL, with the primary end point of assessing the safety of repeated intravenous doses of forodesine hydrochloride. Secondary end points included assessment of the efficacy of the drug in this disease, as well as evaluation of the steady-state pharmacokinetics and correlating pharmacodynamic parameters with any potential response. Patients were to receive 4 weeks of treatment with 5 days of intravenous dosing each week. Patients having clinical response (defined as achieving complete response [CR], CR without platelet recovery, partial response, or stable disease) could receive an additional 4 weeks of treatment with forodesine. Patients were evaluated for grades 3 and 4 non-hematologic toxicity and grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Forodesine treatment would be delayed or dosage reduced depending on the recovery from toxicity. All data were graphed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance (a value of .05) was determined by the 2-tailed paired Student t test. Characteristics of patients enrolled in the in vitro study are provided in Table 1 (pediatric B-ALL [n = 10]; T-ALL [n = 1]; AML [n = 1]; adult B-ALL [n = 2; No. 9001, No. 9002]). When measured by annexin/propidium iodide binding assay (Figure 1), in samples from 8 patients tested, there was heterogeneity in response to forodesine ranging from 2% to 40% apoptosis (normalized to time-matched control), with median 10% apoptosis. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant induction of apoptosis in these cells compared with untreated controls (Figure 1A, Figure 24 hours; P = .018; Figure 1B, Figure 48 hours; P = .041). There was no significant amount of apoptosis in the sample from patient 3, a patient with AML, compared with other patients with B-ALL. We do not have cytotoxicity data for patient 8, a patient with T-ALL. There was significant accumulation of dGTP in these cells, ranging between 3 and 90 microM, with a median 16 microM (24 hours; P = .045; n = 9; Figure 2A) after forodesine and dGuo treatment compared with time-matched controls (Figure 2B; Figure 48 hours). In particular, patient 8, who was diagnosed with T-ALL, showed 3-fold higher accumulation of dGTP levels compared with patients with B-ALL. ',\n"," 'When measured for dATP levels, there was no difference in accumulation between controls and treated samples (Figure 2C), which is consistent with our previous studies in T-cell leukemias. In general, cancer cells, including leukemic cells, are known to sustain their function through active DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. To test if for-odesine can potentially inhibit these macromolecule syntheses in these lymphoblasts as a result of perturbation of the dGTP pool, we performed [3H]uridine and [3H] thymidine incorporation assays to measure their levels of inhibition. Although samples varied in response to forodesine, there was significant inhibition of RNA synthesis at 24 hours (Figure 3A; n = 5; P = .015). For DNA synthesis, there was inhibition observed in 3 of 5 patients; however, the statistical analysis by 2-tailed t test did not show significance (Figure 3B; P = .0675). Samples 3a and 6a were collected at 48 hours for these patients. Of note, the values given are absolute disintegrations per minute values, and one can observe the variations in the basal levels of macromolecule synthesis between different patient samples. Two patients were treated with forodesine at 80 mg/m2/day daily for 5 days through 3 cycles. The study was closed early for slow accrual, and as such no further patients with B-ALL were treated. The first patient, a 61-year-old woman with precursor B-ALL, received initial therapy with the hyperCVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine [Oncovin], doxorubicin [Adriamycin], dexamethasone) regimen plus rituximab and achieved a CR after 2 courses of treatment but had disease relapse within 5 months. She went on to receive multiple salvage regimens, including augmented hyper-CVAD, liposomal vincristine, liposomal annamycin, combination high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate with alemtuzumab and rituximab, without achieving a response. She was then enrolled in the study and received 3 cycles of forodesine, with disease progression on day 8 of the third cycle, and treatment was discontinued. Five days later, she was hospitalized for progressive shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic pain and died of the complications of her disease and infection. The second patient was a 23-year-old woman with precursor B-ALL and t(4;11) who achieved CR after receiving 2 courses of the hyperCVAD regimen. She then underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an HIA-matched sibling after a preparative regimen of total body irradiation, etoposide, and rituximab. Her disease relapsed after transplantation and she received salvage therapy with liposomal vincristine and dexamethasone without a response. ',\n"," 'She completed 1 cycle of forodesine but experienced intracranial hemorrhage shortly after the initiation of cycle 2 and died of the associated complications. In summary, neither patient achieved a CR, but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. The pretreatment and end of infusion samples were collected between days 1 and 5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of week 2 and week 3. The red blood cells were isolated from whole blood, and the cells were processed to determine percent PNP inhibition in these samples. The inhibition of PNP for patient No. 9001 before therapy was 0% and increased to a median of 84% of inhibition (range 76%-95%) (Figure 4). Because accumulation of dGTP is promoted by PNP inhibition, > 90% PNP inhibition is required for this agent to be efficacious. Assessment of PNP inhibition for patient No. 9002 was not performed. To determine if forodesine was at steady-state level, we next measured the plasma forodesine levels during therapy in these 2 patients. Forodesine levels were quantitated on day 0 and at the end of infusion between days 1 and 5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of week 2 and week 3 (n = 2). For patient No. 9001 (Figure 5A; solid line), on day 0 the forodesine level was 0 microM and increased to 12 microM on day 1. By day 2, the level dropped to 2 microM before infusion and increased to 12 microM at the end of infusion. The pattern was very similar between pretreatment and end of infusion. For patient No. 9002 (Figure 5A; dashed line) the pattern was similar; however, the levels were almost half that of the other patient. The levels increased to 6 microM (range 4.7-6.7 microM) and dropped to 1 microM (range 0.21-2.3 microM) after treatment. These forodesine levels were comparatively higher than those in the samples of the patient with B-CLL, in which the maximum was 1.3 microM. With these concentrations of plasma forodesine and levels of PNP inhibition, an increase in endogenous dGuo was expected. The level of dGuo in pretreatment samples for patient No. 9001 was less than the level of detection and increased to 22 microM and then further to 38 microM and was maintained at 12 microM on day 4 of week 3 (Figure 5B; solid line). ',\n"," \"For patient No. 9002, the levels were again lower, ranging from 7 to 12 microM (Figure 5B; dashed line). The starting level of intracellular dGTP for patient No. 9001 on day 0 of cycle 1 was 11 microM and increased to 18 microM by the end of infusion. On day 2, there was an increase to 270 microM, with further elevation to 310 microM at the end of infusion. This level was maintained until day 4 of cycle 1. By cycle 3, the levels dropped to 37 microM and were maintained through day 4 (Figure 6A). For patient No. 9002, the intracellular dGTP levels were 10-fold less, with a maximum level of 15 microM (Figure 6B), suggesting heterogeneity in the accumulation of dGTP between patients. ALL is the most common malignancy of childhood. Although the cure rates for childhood ALL are currently about 80%, the outcome of relapsed ALL remains dismal, with an overall survival of only 10% for patients with early bone marrow relapse or a second or subsequent relapse. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the mainstay of treatment for relapsed ALL. However, recurrence rates are as high as 90% for patients with morphologic evidence of residual disease going into HSCT. In addition, higher levels of pretransplantation minimal residual disease have been shown to predict relapse after HSCT. 34-36 To that end, novel agents with the ability to induce a minimal residual disease:negative remission are needed. Forodesine may also play an important role in the setting of recurrent T-cell ALL now that nelarabine is moving to frontline regimens for those with high-risk disease. However, the role of forodesine in B-cell ALL is not clear. Preclinical investigations in primary T-ALL and B-ALL cells from pediatric patients have demonstrated activity of forodesine and dGuo in B lymphoblasts. The lower activity in B-ALL was associated with less dGTP accumulation, which may result from a lower level of expression of nucleoside transporters in B cells and a higher level of 5'-nucleotidase. In contrast to other nucleoside analogs, dGuo, as well as ara-G, are phosphorylated by dGuo kinase as well as dCyd kinase. Furthermore, both dGuo and ara-G are preferred substrates for dGuo kinase compared with dCyd kinase. At the mRNA level, both these kinases are present at similar levels in T lymphoblasts and B lymphoblasts from children. \",\n"," 'However, levels of proteins and the activity of enzymes will also affect the level of accumulation of triphosphate. This may explain heterogeneity among patients to accumulate dGTP after 24 and 48 hours of incubation with for-odesine and dGuo (Figure 2 A and B). Although there was only a modest effect on cell death of B-leukemic lymphoblasts (Figure 1), there was inhibition of DNA synthesis, suggesting there could be an impact on the cell proliferative index (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in a B-lymphoblastic cell line with ara-G, in which some S-phase cells were killed but then cells were blocked in S-phase of the cell cycle. This is in contrast to T cells, in which a majority of cells in S phase were killed; this was followed by cell death in other phases of the cell cycle by activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Partial inhibition of proliferation with limited apoptosis has also been observed in myeloma cell lines: another B-cell neoplasm albeit mature plasma B cells. Forodesine is a potent inhibitor of PNP, the mRNA of which is present at slightly higher levels in B cells. Most of the PNP is in large body organs and red blood cells. At the physiologic dose in patients with B-ALL, there was more than 85% inhibition of this enzyme in red blood cells (Figure 4). This inhibition resulted in a peak of at least 10 mM of dGuo in plasma (Figure 5B), suggesting that the desired concentration of dGuo could be achieved in patients with B-ALL. However, only higher levels of dGuo (patient No. 9001) resulted in more than 200 microM dGTP in B lymphoblasts. Lower dGuo resulted in only 10 microM of dGTP (Figure 6). Collectively, these data suggest that forodesine will need to be infused with dGuo or combined with chemotherapeutic agents based on the mechanistic rationale to have clinically meaningful activity in B-ALL. Despite advances in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with ALL, disease relapses in a significant majority of the former and a minority of the latter. New agents are needed to improve the outcome of these patients. Inhibition of PNP leading to depletion of T cells has been demonstrated with forodesine, an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor that has been previously evaluated for its efficacy in patients with T-ALL. Aside from T-ALL, forodesine has also demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in indolent lymphoid neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ',\n"," 'The current study was conducted to evaluate the activity of this agent in B-ALL, using lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with B-ALL for in vitro analysis. Concurrently, a phase II study examined the role of this agent in various leukemias, including 2 adult patients with B-ALL. Although the limited data prohibit definitive conclusions, this study suggests that forodesine may be a useful agent for B-ALL only when used in combination with other agents. ',\n"," 'New therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are needed, particularly those that can eradicate residual disease and elicit anti-CLL immune responses. CD40 ligation on CLL cells, which can be achieved using adenovirus encoding chimeric CD154 (Ad-ISF35), enhances their ability to function as antigen-presenting cells and increases their sensitivity to clearance by immune-effector mechanisms. In this study, we report the results of a first-in-man phase I trial of intranodal direct injection (IDI) of Ad-ISF35 in patients with CLL to evaluate toxicity, safety, and tolerability. Fifteen patients received a single IDI of 1 x 1010 to 33 x1010 Ad-ISF35 viral particles (vp), with a defined maximum tolerated dose as 1 x 1011 vp. Although the most common adverse events were transient grade 1 to 2 pain at the injection site and flu-like symptoms following IDI, some patients receiving the highest dose had transient, asymptomatic grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia, neutropenia, or transaminitis. Increased expression of death receptor, immune costimulatory molecules, and Ad-ISF35 vector DNA was detected in circulating CLL cells. Notably, we also observed preliminary clinical responses, including reductions in leukemia cell counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Six patients did not require additional therapy for more than 6 months, and three achieved a partial remission. In conclusion, Ad-ISF35 IDI was safely delivered in patients with CLLs and induced systemic biologic and clinical responses. These results provide the rationale for phase II studies in CLLs, lymphomas, and CD40-expressing solid tumors. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal B cells in the blood, lymphoid tissues, and marrow. Although advances in chemoimmunotherapy have resulted in improved response rates and have prolonged survival, such treatments can also impair hematopoiesis and immune function and are not well tolerated by all patients, particularly the elderly. Furthermore, most treated patients eventually relapse and require additional therapy and the disease still is considered incurable. It has been reported that the lymph node and bone marrow microenviroments play an important role in protecting CLL cells from apoptosis. Evidence exists to postulate that proliferating CLL cells in the lymph nodes are the source of the nonproliferating CLL cells present in the peripheral blood. However, most therapies used currently in CLLs do not target residual niches or leukemia cells that may depend heavily on the microenvironment. ',\n"," 'As such, relapse after chemotherapybased treatment is inevitable and this argues in favor of the development of novel treatment alternatives, including those that promote immune stimulation and activation of the tumor microenvironment. We have addressed this problem by studying in vitro and in vivo mechanism to promote cellular activation and immune recognition in CLL with an approach that involves transduction of CLL cells with vectors encoding the ligand for CD40 (CD154; ref.). Although the leukemia cells express high levels of human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) required for presentation of antigen to T cells, CLL cells are poor antigen-presenting cells. These cells lack expression of the immune costimulatory molecules required for effective T-cell activation and instead appear to suppress T-cell function. CD40 activation using recombinant antibodies or CD154 ligands have been used in patients with cancer and CLL showing objective clinical responses. Activation of B cells through CD40 changes its phenotype and induces immunoglobulin class switching and enhances its antigen-presenting capacity. Similar changes are also observed when CLL cells are activated via ligation of CD40, which can be achieved through transduction of CLL cells with an adenovirus (Ad) vector encoding CD154. Such transduced and CD40-activated CLL cells can induce autologous T-cell activation and immune recognition, leading to generation of anti-leukemia immune responses. We previously conducted clinical trials evaluating the safety and clinical activity of this approach. For these trials, patients underwent leukapheresis and CLL cells were subsequently transduced ex vivo with an Ad vector encoding either mouse-CD154 or a chimeric-humanized CD154, termed Ad-ISF35. Ad-ISF35 was developed to mitigate generation of immunity against mouse-CD154 and to improve membrane stability. Transduction of CLL cells with Ad-CD154 or Ad-ISF35 generated transduced CLL cells that had phenotypic features of CLL cells that had been activated by contact with CD154-bearing cells. Moreover, as these transduced CLL cells expressed a ligand for CD40, they also could activate bystander, nontransduced CLL cells to undergo such phenotypic changes. Clinical studies showed that i.v. infusions of autologous CLL cells that had been transduced with Ad-CD154 or Ad-ISF35 did not cause unacceptable or long-term toxicity, induced activation of \"bystander\" nontransduced CLL cells similar to that achieved by contact with CD154-/ISF35-bearing cells, almost invariably resulted in acute reductions in leukemia cell blood counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and could induce anti-leukemia immune responses. ',\n"," 'this approach, which also requires ex vivo processing of cells in specialized facilities that are not widely available. Therefore, we considered whether we could achieve similar biologic and clinical responses by injecting the Ad-ISF35 vector directly into pathologically enlarged lymph nodes of patients with CLL. This hypothesis is supported by preclinical studies in test animals showing that direct injection of Ad-ISF35 into tumor nodules is safe and capable of inducing antitumor responses. Thus, we conducted a first-in-man phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate toxicity, tolerability, and safety of Ad-ISF35 intranodal direct injection (IDI) in patients with CLL. Patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki to participate in this study. We enrolled and treated 15 patients who met the eligibility criteria, including diagnosis of CLL and progressive disease (PD) requiring treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL; refs.). All patients were offered standard chemoimmunotherapy but declined this treatment in favor of participating in this study. Patients presented at least one single accessible and palpable lymph node in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal regions. The size of the lymph nodes was larger than 2 x 2 cm in the horizontal and perpendicular axes. Additional inclusion criteria were hemoglobin >=10 g/dL, platelet count >=50 x 103/mm3 , total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine <=2x ULN (upper limit of normal), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <=2, and anticipated survival of at least 3 months. Patients were excluded from participating in this clinical trial if they had received treatment with chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies within 28 days before entering the study. Additional treatments for CLL were not allowed during the time of participation in this trial. In addition, patients with history of secondary malignancies within 5 years of registration were excluded from the protocol (except for patients with history of treated non-melanoma skin cancer). The study used a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 dose cohorts to receive one IDI of 1 x 1010, 3.3 x 1010, 1x1011, or 3.3 x 1011 viral particles (vp) of Ad-ISF35 (provided by Memgen, LLC). The injected node was in the axilla and greater than 2 x 2 cm in size before injection. The study design was reviewed and approved by the U.S. ',\n"," \"Food and Drug Administration (BB-IND 13046), the Recombinant Advisory Committee (RAC) of the NIH (Bethesda, MD), the University of California San Diego (UCSD, La Jolla, CA) Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and the UCSD Institutional Review Board. This clinical trial was registered in the NIH database (registration NCT00783874; ref.). We evaluated the patient's white blood cell counts (WBC), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), platelet counts (plt), hemoglobin (Hb), and size of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes before and at designated times after Ad-ISF35 IDI. The follow-up period included frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations on days 0,1, 2, 7,14, 21, 30, 60, and 84 after injection and every 3 months thereafter for a total of 1 year. Assessment of response to treatment was evaluated following the IWCLL guidelines. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any adverse event grade 3 or higher that was considered by the investigator to be possibly related or related to Ad-ISF35 treatment. DLTs were evaluated only during the first 21 days of treatment and their assessment determined dose escalation and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, modified for hematologic toxicities according to the IWCLL guidelines. Hematologic adverse events were considered DLT if they were grade 4 or higher and lasted 7 days or more. We defined the MTD as the highest dose where no more than one patient of 6 presented DLTs. Ten million of isolated WBCs/mL in PBS (+1% FBS) were incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs specific for CD5, CD19, CD54, CD80, CD86, CD20, DR5, CD3, CD4, CD8, mCD154 (used for detection of ISF35 protein expression), CD95, CD23 and kappa- or lambda-immunoglobulin light chain (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flow-Jo software (Tree Star Inc.). We examined serum samples for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TNF-alpha, granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IFN-gamma via Luminex xMAP technology following manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Luminex 100TM IS machine and BeadView Multiplex software v1.0 was used for data analysis by Spline curve-fitting method. We measured serum antibodies against Ad-ISF35 or recombinant human CD154 (rhCD154) protein by ELISA. \",\n"," \"Plates were coated with 4 x 109 vp/mL of Ad-ISF35 or 2 microg/mL of rhCD154 (R&D Systems) for 2 hours at 37 C. Plates were blocked with PBS/Tween 0.01%, bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1%. Sera samples collected on days 0 and 28 were added at different dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was added at 1:5,000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS-Tween 0.01%, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added, and reaction was stopped by adding 1N phosphoric acid. Optical densities were obtained in a SpectraMax250 plate reader (Molecular Devices). EC50 of each the serum was calculated with GraphPad Prism 4.0. Serial dilutions of serum samples were preincubated with 4 x 108 vp/mL of Ad-ISF35 for 10 minutes at 37 C. Then, the serum samples were added to 2 x 104 HeLa cells in 96-well plates for 24 hours at 37 C. HeLa cells were incubated with PBS-EDTA enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Gibco) for 10 minutes at 37 C and then incubated with 2 microL of antimouse CD154 and phycoerythrin-labeled (BD Pharmigen) for 30 minutes at 4 C. Fluorescence data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analysis was carried out using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Antibody neutralization activity was assessed by decrease in ISF35 (protein encoded by Ad-ISF35) expression in HeLa cells cultured with Ad-ISF35 preincubated with serum dilutions compared with the control cells incubated with Ad-IS35 without serum. Neutralizing activity was defined as at least 2-fold increase compared with pretreatment sample. We used a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that could detect 5 DNA copies or more of Ad-ISF35 in 100 ng of genomic DNA All the samples were tested in duplicate with a cycle threshold (Ct) variability that was less than 5% for Ad-ISF35 amplification. The following primers were used for Ad-ISF35 amplification (400 nmol/L): forward, 5'CCT CTG GCT GAA GCC CAG 3'; reverse, 5'CTC CCA AGT GAA TGG ATT GT 3'. MGB-FAM probe 5'TTACTCAAGGCGGCAAA3' was used at 250 nmol/L. The PCR reaction was carried out using TaqMan qPCR Universal Master Mix w/UNG from Applied Biosystems. The qPCR program used was 95 C for 3 minutes; 40 cycles: 95 C for 20 seconds, 52 C for 1 minute; and 20 seconds in Bio-Rad cycler iQ5 PCR machine. beta-Actin was used to monitor DNA quality. \",\n"," 'To calculate the Ad-ISF35 DNA copies present in given sample of DNA or cDNA, we used a standard curve with viral DNA ranging from 5 x 107 to 5 x 1010 viral copies. We used the IFN-gamma ELISPOT plates from R&D Systems, Inc. T cells from pre- and posttreatment (showing the highest number of CD8+ cells) from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated with Dynabeads against CD4 and CD8 (Invitrogen). CLL cells (5 x 106) from pretreatment samples (depleted of CD4 and CD8) were cultured for 24 hours with HeLa cells expressing CD154 (4 x 105) in 12-well plates. CLL cells were removed from cocultures and added into empty wells for 2 hours to allow floating HeLa-CD154 cells to reattach to the plate. CLL cells were washed and incubated with mitomycin C (60microg/mL) for 1 hour at 37 C. Activation of CLL cells was confirmed by flow cytometry measuring the upregulation of CD54 and CD95 markers. A total of 1 x 105 CLL nonactivated (CD4- and CD8-depleted) or CLL CD154-activated cells were cultured for 48 hours with 1x105 T cells plus L-2 (25 IU/mL). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic and baseline characteristics, clinical response variables, immunologic variables, and toxicity data. Univariate analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA with pre- and posttreatment values. HRs were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. All analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v4.0 and JMP v8.0. Five females and 10 males with a median age of 56 years (45-73 years) were enrolled in this study. The median leukemia cell doubling time for all patients was 3.3 months (0.9-22.5 months). The median number of prior treatments was 2 (0-7). Two patients were refractory to fludarabine-based treatment. CLL cells expressed unmutated Ig heavy chain variable region genes (IgVH) in 7 patients and ZAP-70 in 9 patients. Six patients had leukemia cells with adverse cytogenetics, 4 with deletions at 11q, and 2 with deletions at 17p (Table 1). All patients received Ad-ISF35 IDI. Only 2 of 15 patients did not complete the postinjection observation period of 84 days due to disease progression. The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions and systemic flu-like symptoms. Four patients had transient grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. One of these patients in cohort 2 presented grade 3 neutropenia that lasted for 6 days. ',\n"," 'This was not considered as DLT as the adverse event was not grade >= 4 and the duration was less than 7 days. In cohort 3, the first 3 patients did not present any DLTs. In cohort 4, 3 patients were enrolled, 2 of them presented DLTs including hypophosphatemia (grade 3 and 4) and AST elevation (grade 3). Because of this, we proceeded to enroll 3 additional patients in cohort 3 (3E). One patient presented with neutropenia grade 4 (not considered DLT as it lasted only 5 days) and one patient with hypophosphatemia grade 3 (considered DLT; Table 2). All adverse effects were subclinical and self-limiting. With these data, we defined cohort 3 dose (1 x 1011 vp) as the MTD. In addition, we have not observed long-term adverse effects associated with Ad-ISF35 IDI after a median follow-up of 2.5 years. We monitored the presence Ad-ISF35 DNA and ISF35 (protein encoded by Ad-ISF35 vector) expression in PBMCs collected before and after Ad-ISF35 IDI. For detection of Ad-ISF35 DNA, we used a sensitive qPCR assay capable of detecting 5 copies of Ad-ISF35 DNA in 100 ng of genomic DNA (gDNA). Ad-ISF35 was detected in only 3 patients 8 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI. Each of these patients had PBMCs with less than 9 copies of Ad-ISF35 per 100 ng of gDNA. Ad-ISF35 DNA was not detected at later time points (Fig. 1A). ISF35 protein surface expression was measured by flow cytometry. The results did not show detectable expression of ISF35 protein on the PBMCs of any patient at any time point (data not shown). Most patients (n = 14) experienced transient increases in platelet counts at day 7 and 14. None of the patients developed worsening anemia after injection (Fig. 1B). Also, we observed changes in T cells in the majority of patients enrolled in this study. During the first 48 hours, most patients (n = 11) had a transient fall in ALC (Fig. 1C) and absolute T-cell counts (Fig. 1D). The acute drop in T-cell counts was significant when compared with baseline levels in both cell subsets (CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ cells; P < 0.05). However, the majority of patients (n = 10) later showed an increase of T cells ranging from 6% to 311% during the first 4 weeks after Ad-ISF35 IDI. ',\n"," 'We observed that the majority of patients experienced an increase in ANC during the first 2 days following Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 1D). We observed systemic biologic responses to Ad-ISF35 IDI in most patients. In particular, we observed statistically significant upregulation of CD95, CD20, and HLAI during the first 48 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 1E). Such phenotypic changes are similar to those of CLL cells cocultured with CD154-bearing cells in vitro. We also noted that levels of IFN-g and IL-6 in the sera of 11 of 14 patients increased 1 day after Ad-ISF35 IDI relative to pretreatment levels. The relative increase in serum IFN-g appeared proportionate to the administered dose of Ad-ISF35 (linear trend analysis, P = 0.0328, r2 = 0.35); patients in cohorts 3 and 4 had the highest posttreatment serum levels of IFN-gamma (Fig. 2A). We evaluated whether cytokines or other factors present in the serum of patients who received Ad-ISF35 IDI were responsible for the phenotypic changes observed in circulating leukemic cells. CLL cells were cultured with autologous serum samples collected before and 1 day after Ad-ISF35 IDI. As a control, the same CLL cells were stimulated by coculture with CD154-bearing cells (HeLa-CD154). The expression levels of surface immune costimulatory molecules and death receptors were evaluated via flow cytometry. CLL cells cultured with sera collected before or after Ad-ISF35 IDI did not induce increased expression of these surface antigens. In contrast, CLL cells cocultured with HeLa-CD154 expressed higher levels of CD95 or immune costimulatory molecules than CLL cells cocultured with wild-type HeLa (Fig. 2B). Samples collected before and after Ad-ISF35 IDI from 4 patients were evaluated by ELISPOT assay to detect IFN-gamma production from T cells in response to coculture with CD40-stimulated autologous CLL cells. In these patients, we did not observe significant increase in the levels of T-cell/IFN-gamma production after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Supplementary Fig. S1). We evaluated for antibodies specific for adenovirus or human CD154 (hCD154). Sera collected from patients before Ad-ISF35 IDI had median titer of anti-adenovirus antibodies of 352 [confidence interval (CI), 173-531]. However, sera collected 1 month after therapy had significantly higher titers (median, 622; CI, 151-1,093; P < 0.05). Except for patient #10, the antiadenovirus antibodies induced by Ad-ISF35 IDI did not neutralize the capacity of adenovirus to infect HeLa cells in vitro (Table 3). None of the patients developed detectable antibodies to human CD154. ',\n"," 'Although Ad-ISF35 IDI was injected into a single axillary lymph node, we observed systemic clinical responses. The magnitude of these responses did not appear to have a clear dose-response relationship. Considering the best response during 84 days after Ad-ISF35 IDI, 87%, 80%, and 53% of patients had respective reductions in lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or ALC by more than 50% (Fig. 3A). The response observed in spleen and lymph nodes was durable during the course of the study (Fig. 3B). Three patients achieved partial response (PR), 7 patients had stable disease (SD), and 5 had PD by IWCLL criteria (refs.; Table 1). Six patients (patients 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, and 15) had durable responses (median, 8.8 months) and did not require additional treatment for over 6 months. Two of these patients (patients 2 and 5) did not require additional treatment for over a year after Ad-ISF35 IDI. The median time to next treatment (TNTx) for all patients was 5 months. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine hazard ratios (HR) comparing the duration of response (>=6 months), with variables such as number of prior therapies (<=1), ZAP-70 (<=20% positive cells), B2M levels (<=2.5 mg/L), IgG levels (<=500 mg/dL), splenomegaly (<=5 cm), and bidimensional lymph node product (total <=70 cm2). This analysis showed that only the number of prior therapies (<=1) had a statistically significant correlation with the duration of response (HR, 0.1491; CI, 0.04071-0.5464; P = 0.0041; Table 4). Therefore, patients who had no more than one prior treatment for CLL were 6.7 times more likely to have a durable response (TNTx >= 6 months). We examined the safety of gene immunotherapy using Ad-ISF35 IDI in patients with CLL. The injection of Ad-ISF35 into an axillary lymph node was safely delivered and without long-term adverse effects. Most of adverse effects were anticipated and of low-grade (grade 1 or 2). These included flu-like symptoms and erythema or pain at the site of injection. Such adverse effects have been observed in patients injected with adenovirus vectors directly into tumor nodules and most likely represent an inflammatory response to adenovirus infection/transduction. Many of the adverse events noted in this study also were similar to those observed in patients infused with autologous CLL cells transduced ex vivo with Ad-mCD154 or Ad-ISF35. ',\n"," 'In these ex vivo studies, patients who received the highest dose of transduced cells generally had a higher incidence of grade 2 versus grade 1 adverse events. We observed a similar dose relationship in patients receiving the 2 higher doses of Ad-ISF35, suggesting that there might be a relationship between the injected dose of Ad-ISF35 and frequency or intensity of adverse events. We observed grade 3/4 neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and AST elevation in 6 patients treated in cohorts 2, 3E, and 4. In 3 of these patients (n = 2 in cohort 4 and n = 1 in cohort 3E), hypophosphatemia and AST elevation were considered DLTs and thus defined the MTD as 1 x 1011 vp (cohort 3 dose). All the adverse events observed were subclinical and transient. The grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia observed could be related to increased serum levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 during the first 24 hours following Ad-ISF35 IDI. Hypophosphatemia has been associated with high serum levels of such inflammatory cytokines in patients with sepsis and in mice injected with IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-1beta. Some patients in the cohorts that received the higher doses also experienced transient elevations in serum hepatic transaminases. Although such transient and asymptomatic elevation of transaminases has been observed in patients who received i.v. injections of adenovirus vectors, the patient who had grade 3 elevation in AST elevation did not have detectable Ad-ISF35 in the blood. As such, it is conceivable that the transient elevations in hepatic transaminases instead could be associated with high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines could have been secreted in response to adenovirus infection as well as in response to CD40-CD154 stimulation. Several patients had decreased ALC and elevated ANC during the first 48 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI, only to develop neutropenia 2 to 3 weeks later. Early increases in blood neutrophils associated with decreases in blood lymphocytes have been observed in mice infused with syngeneic dendritic cells stimulated by CD154 and IL-2 and pulsed with lymphoma antigens. Changes in ANC could be a direct response to modulation of the CD40-CD154 pathway as it has been observed in our mouse model and in patients with CD154 deficiency and hyper-IgM syndrome. On the other hand, neutropenia could be secondary to elevated levels of IFN-gamma and/or IL-6. Nevertheless, each patient recovered with no evidence of infection or other related complications. ',\n"," 'We observed fluctuation in T-cell counts after Ad-ISF35 IDI. Initially, during the first 48 hours after injection, the T cells decreased significantly and this could be in response to viral infection, cytokines, cell migration, or activation-induced cell death. At later time points, the majority of patients showed increase in T cells up to 300%, which was similar to what we have observed in previous studies using Ad-CD154. We studied whether T cells isolated after therapy were reactive against autologous CLL cells using ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma. However, in 4 patients available for evaluation, we did not observe reactivity of T cells against CD40-stimulated CLL cells. This finding is different than our previous experience in patients receiving ex vivo transduced autologous CLL cells with Ad-CD154. It is unclear the reasons for the lack of evidence of T-cell stimulation in response to AD-ISF35 IDI measured by IFN-gamma ELISPOT. Potential explanations could be the different route of administration (ex vivo vs. IDI), sample size, and time of analysis of the samples. Other immunemediated processes including microenvironment cell activation of macrophages could be responsible for the objective responses observed in some patients in this study. It is conceivable to hypothesize that multiple intranodal injections could enhance immunologic responses including T-cell reactivity against CLL antigens. We will address these mechanistic questions in future studies. We did not find evidence for Ad-ISF35 DNA in the PBMCs except in 3 patients, who had trace levels of detectable Ad-ISF35 DNA (close to the low-limit of sensitivity) 8 hours after injection. In addition, we did not detect expression of ISF35 protein on circulating CLL cells at any time following Ad-ISF35 IDI. Nevertheless, all patients experienced a systemic biologic response. We observed phenotypic changes in the circulating CLL cells that included expression of immune costimulatory molecules and death receptors. These changes were similar to those observed in vitro after leukemia cells are cultured with CD154-expressing cells. It is unlikely that the clinical and biologic activity observed after Ad-ISF35 IDI are mediated by direct transduction of cells distant from the injected lymph node. Our data in an A20 lymphoma mouse model have shown that after intratumoral injections, Ad-ISF35 is primarily found in tumor tissues with no evidence of accumulation or persistence in peripheral organs with a rapid virus clearance 24 hours after injection. ',\n"," 'In the same mouse model, we have detected the transduction not only in lymphoma cells but also in other important cells from the microenvironment such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells (manuscript in preparation). This suggests the possibility that phenotypic changes of microenvironment of cells may play a role in response to intratumoral Ad-ISF35 injection. Similarly, our data suggest that serum cytokines or other soluble factors are not entirely responsible for the phenotypic changes observed after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the presence of systemic objective clinical response observed in conjunction with phenotypic changes and the lack of detectable Ad-ISF35 in circulating leukemia cells suggest that these effects are due to the stimulation generated by either contact with ISF35-bearing cells or other nontransduced activated cells, providing the so-called bystander-effect. Lymph node biopsies before and after Ad-ISF35 injection could have provided additional insight into this process. However, they were not conducted in this study to avoid additional local toxicities and adverse events that could interfere with the primary endpoint of this phase I study, which was to evaluate safety and tolerability. We are planning to conduct these biopsies in subsequent clinical trials. One concern was whether Ad-ISF35 IDI would induce autoantibodies reactive with hCD154. Such autoantibodies conceivably could induce adverse effects that are similar to those noted for some patients treated with antibodies specific for CD154. However, none of the patients developed antibodies reactive with hCD154. Nevertheless, 40% of treated patients were induced to increase their titers of antibodies of anti-adenovirus, indicating that Ad-ISF35 IDI could elicit an anti-adenovirus antibody response even in patients who have immune deficiency associated with CLL. Moreover, patients with CLL typically have hypogammaglobulinemia (median serum IgG levels in this study was 496 mg/dL) and typically respond poorly to administered vaccines. One of the treated patient also developed antibodies to adenovirus that could neutralize Ad-ISF35. It is uncertain whether the development of such antibodies can mitigate the activity of subsequent injections of Ad-ISF35. This will be evaluated in subsequent clinical studies examining the safety and activity of repeated administrations of Ad-ISF35 IDI. Although the primary purpose of the current study was to examine the safety of Ad-ISF35 IDI, we observed objective clinical responses in the majority of the patients treated. Patients experienced a 50% or more reduction in leukemia cell counts (7 of 15), lymphadenopathy (13 of 15), or splenomegaly (12 of 15). ',\n"," 'Six patients did not require additional treatment for 6 months or more and 3 patients achieved a PR. Moreover, responses achieved in the spleen and lymph nodes were durable and the majority of patients requiring additional treatment did so because of persistent lymphocytosis. This suggests that Ad-ISF35 can promote changes in the microenvironment of lymph nodes and spleen that could translate into a clinical benefit. Further studies to corroborate these observations are needed. Clinical responses in CLL can be compartmentalized. Patients can have excellent reduction of lymphocytosis but no response in large lymph nodes like in the case of patients treated with alemtuzumab, or good reduction in lymphadenopathy and spleen, but lack of response or lymphocytosis progression like in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the patients reported in this phase I study, we observed better and more durable responses in reduction of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Despite the fact that most patients had some degree of response (Fig. 3), only 3 of them fulfill all the criteria needed to achieve a clinical response based on the international guidelines. Previously untreated patients or those with less than one previous treatment showed the best clinical responses to Ad-ISF35 IDI (almost 7 times more likely to have durable responses). This supports the notion that early immunologic intervention in patients with CLL could result in better clinical outcomes. Although whether prior treatment with drugs or agents that suppress immune function mitigates the activity of Ad-ISF35 IDI needs to be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials. In summary, this first-in-man phase I clinical study shows that gene immunotherapy using Ad-ISF35 IDI is feasible and safe. We defined the dose of 1 x 1011 vp per injection as the MTD. Even though the study was designed to determine safety and tolerability of a single Ad-ISF35 IDI, we also observed systemic biologic and clinical effects. This is despite the fact that we could not detect expression of ISF35 protein in mononuclear cells isolated from the blood of patients following Ad-ISF35 IDI. This suggests that such responses were due to a bystander-effect in which leukemia cells are induced to undergo phenotypic changes when in contact with ISF35-bearing cells or other nontransduced activated cells. ',\n"," 'Our results also indicate that Ad-ISF-35 IDI-induced antibody, cytokine responses, and changes in the phenotype of circulating CLL cells that are consistent with immune activation similar to that induced by i.v. administration of autologous Ad-ISF35-transduced CLL cells. This suggests a greater interchange of cells between the blood, spleen, and lymphoid compartments of patients with CLL. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study conducted in patients with CLL showing that direct intratumoral/intranodal modulation by an immune-based strategy can result in clinical activity. This argues that the tumor microenvironment is a relevant target in this disease. ',\n"," \"In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P = 0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.) Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a variable natural history that is partly predicted by clinical and genomic features. Therapy for CLL has evolved from monotherapy with alkylating agents to chemoimmunotherapy. Each of the combination regimens has shown prolonged rates of progression- free survival, as compared with similar regimens that do not contain antibodies. Treatment of patients with relapsed CLL often includes regimens such as bendamustine and rituximab, ofatumumab, or investigational agents. \",\n"," \"Ofatumumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency on the basis of a single-group study involving patients who had resistance to fludarabine and alemtuzumab therapy; with an overall response rate of 58%, ofatumumab has been recommended in international consensus guidelines as a therapeutic option for patients with previously treated CLL. A short duration of response to initial therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities have been associated with a poor outcome among patients receiving conventional therapy. Identifying new therapies that prolong survival remains an important need for these patients. Ibrutinib (Imbruvica, Pharmacyclics and Janssen) is a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, an essential enzyme in B-cell receptor signaling, homing, and adhesion. On the basis of response rates in single-group, phase 2 studies, ibrutinib was recognized by the FDA as a breakthrough therapy and was granted accelerated approval for patients with mantle-cell lymphoma (in November 2013) and CLL (in February 2014) who had received at least one previous therapy. Among patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), those who received ibrutinib had a response rate of 71%, according to investigator assessment, and a progression-free survival rate of 75% at 2 years. In this study, drug toxicity did not result in the discontinuation of ibrutinib in most patients. On the basis of early results of the phase 2 trial, we initiated a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, the Study of Ibrutinib versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE), to compare once-daily oral ibrutinib with an active control single-agent therapy, ofatumumab, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL. Patients with CLL or SLL requiring therapy were eligible for enrollment if they had received at least one previous therapy and were considered to be inappropriate candidates for purine analogue treatment because they had a short progression-free interval after chemoimmunotherapy or because they had coexisting illnesses, an age of 70 years or more, or a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion (Text S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). \",\n"," 'an absolute neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per microliter, a platelet count of at least 30,000 cells per microliter, and adequate liver and kidney function. Patients requiring warfarin or strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors were excluded. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics and Janssen. All the authors and their research teams collected the data. Representatives of Pharmacyclics designed the study, confirmed the accuracy of the data, and compiled the data for analysis; Janssen representatives had no active role in the study. The authors had full access to the data and analyses for the compilation of this report. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript, which was reviewed, modified, and approved in its final version by all the authors. Editorial assistance was provided by two professional medical editors funded by Pharmacyclics. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org) and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. An independent review committee, whose members were unaware of study-group assignments and lymphocyte counts, assessed progression and response. An independent data and safety monitoring committee evaluated safety and reviewed data from the protocol-specified interim analysis. From June 2012 through April 2013, we enrolled 391 patients at 67 sites in the United States, Australia, and seven European countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral ibrutinib (at a dose of 420 mg once daily) until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects or intravenous ofatumumab for up to 24 weeks at an initial dose of 300 mg at week 1, followed by a dose of 2000 mg weekly for 7 weeks and then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, consistent with local labeling. Patients were stratified according to whether they had resistance to purine analogue chemoimmunotherapy (defined as no response or a relapse within 12 months after the last dose of a purine analogue) and whether they had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. ',\n"," 'During this study, promising data from the phase 2 trial led investigators to request, and the steering committee to recommend, crossover of patients in the ofatumumab group to the ibrutinib group. This revision was supported by the data and safety monitoring committee and was discussed with health authorities. Approximately 4 months after the last patient underwent randomization, a protocol amendment allowed patients in the ofatumumab group who had disease progression, as confirmed by an independent review committee, to receive ibrutinib. The primary end point was the duration of progression- free survival, as assessed by the independent review committee, according to the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. (Details regarding criteria for a complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.) On the basis of a clarification adopted in 2012, treatment-related lymphocytosis was not considered to be progressive disease. Key secondary end points included the duration of overall survival and the response rate. The criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia require the use of computed tomography (CT) to evaluate response and persistent improvement for at least 2 months to confirm response. Patients were monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks, every 4 weeks until month 6, and then every 12 weeks, with full response assessments performed every 12 weeks. Toxicity was graded according to the criteria of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0; the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia were used to evaluate hematologic toxicity. Reports of eye-related adverse events were collected proactively on the basis of preclinical toxicology studies in dogs that revealed corneal abnormalities in animals receiving ibrutinib at a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (equivalent dose in humans, 81 mg per kilogram per day). Pathologists at a central laboratory assessed the results of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate cytogenetic factors (a procedure that was also performed at local site laboratories), measurements of serum beta2-microglobulin, and mutational analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes. (The presence of unmutated genes is usually associated with a poorer response to therapy and a worse outcome.) The primary end point, progression-free survival, was used in the calculation of the study sample size. ',\n"," \"The number of required events was based on a target hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.60, as calculated with the use of a two-sided log-rank test at an alpha level of 0.05, with a study power of at least 90%. The efficacy boundary (two-sided P<0.028) was crossed at the preplanned interim analysis, and the results from that analysis are presented in this report. The primary analysis was a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to the presence or absence of the chromosome 17p13.1 deletion and the disease refractory status at randomization. The type I error was controlled through adjustment of the significance level with the use of the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for the interim analysis and with the use of a hierarchical closed-testing procedure for primary and ordered secondary end points. The baseline characteristics of the patients were generally well balanced between the two study groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The majority of patients had advanced- stage disease. Patients in the ibrutinib group had undergone a median of three previous therapies, and those in the ofatumumab group had undergone a median of two previous therapies. The majority of patients had received previous treatment with purine analogues, alkylating agents, and anti-CD20 antibodies, which were frequently administered in combination. The percentage of patients with bulky disease (>=5 cm) was higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (64% vs. 52%). Approximately 57% of the patients in the two study groups had a deletion at either chromosome 17p13.1 or chromosome 11q22.3. The median follow-up time was 9.4 months (range, 0.1 to 16.6), and 86% of patients were still receiving ibrutinib at the time of this analysis (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged the duration of progression-free survival, with the median not reached at a median follow-up of 9.4 months, as compared with a median duration of progression-free survival of 8.1 months with ofatumumab. The hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group was 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.32; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). This represents a 78% reduction in the risk of progression or death among patients treated with ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab. At 6 months, 88% of patients in the ibrutinib group were still alive with no disease progression, as compared with 65% in the ofatumumab group. \",\n"," \"The effect of ibrutinib on progression-free survival was observed regardless of baseline clinical characteristics or molecular features (Fig. 2). Among patients with a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, the median duration of progression-free survival was not reached in the ibrutinib group, as compared with a median of 5.8 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.45). At 6 months, 83% of the patients with this deletion in the ibrutinib group, as compared with 49% of those with this deletion in the ofatumumab group, were alive with no disease progression. Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into an aggressive, rapidly growing large-cell lymphoma) was confirmed in two patients in each study group. Prolymphocytic leukemia developed in an additional patient in the ibrutinib group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly prolonged the rate of overall survival (hazard ratio for death in the ibrutinib group, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.79; P = 0.005), with the risk of death reduced by 57% (Fig. 1B). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. At the time of this analysis, 57 patients in the ofatumumab group had crossed over to receive ibrutinib after confirmed disease progression. The survival effect was based on an analysis in which data were censored at the time of crossover. At 12 months, the survival effect was also observed in the uncensored sensitivity analysis (hazard ratio for death, 0.39; P = 0.001), with an overall survival rate of 90% in the ibrutinib group and 79% in the ofatumumab group (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The difference in overall survival supporting the superiority of ibrutinib was preserved in all the subgroups defined according to pretreatment and genetic features (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The independently assessed response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (Fig. 3A). Overall, 43% of the patients in the ibrutinib group had a partial response, as compared with 4% in the ofatumumab group (odds ratio, 17.4; 95% CI, 8.1 to 37.3; P<0.001). In addition, 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib had a partial response with lymphocytosis (resulting in a 63% response rate). Lymphocytosis was observed in 69% of the patients who were treated with ibrutinib and was not considered to be disease progression. \",\n"," 'The condition resolved in 77% of these patients during follow-up. In a recent study, patients with a partial response with lymphocytosis had rates of progression-free survival that were similar to those in patients with a partial response. Investigator- assessed response rates were higher than independently assessed response rates in the two study groups (Fig. 3B). Treatment exposure was longer among patients receiving ibrutinib than among those receiving ofatumumab (median duration, 8.6 months [range, 0.2 to 16.1] vs. 5.3 months [range, 0 to 7.4]). The profiles of cumulative adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of the patients are presented without adjustment for duration of exposure in Table 2. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events that occurred in at least 20% of the patients were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Overall, 57% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and 47% of the patients in the ofatumumab group had at least one adverse event of grade 3 or higher. Serious adverse events are summarized in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred more frequently in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group included diarrhea (4% vs. 2%) and atrial fibrillation (3% vs. 0%); the latter event required cessation of therapy in one patient. An additional four patients in the ibrutinib group and one patient in the ofatumumab group had grade 1 or 2 atrial fibrillation. Bleeding-related adverse events of any grade (most commonly, petechiae, and including ecchymoses) were more common in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (44% vs. 12%). Major hemorrhage (any hemorrhagic event of grade 3 or higher or resulting in transfusion of red cells or in hospitalization) was reported in two patients (1%) in the ibrutinib group (including one patient with a subdural hematoma) and three patients (2%) in the ofatumumab group. Other adverse events that were more commonly noted among patients receiving ibrutinib than among those receiving ofatumumab included rash (8% vs. 4%), pyrexia (24% vs. 15%), and blurred vision (10% vs. 3%); all these events were generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. The incidence of cataracts was 3% and 1%, respectively. ',\n"," 'Infections of any grade were more common in the ibrutinib group (70% vs. 54%), whereas the frequency of infections of grade 3 or higher was similar in the two study groups (24% vs. 22%) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Infusion reactions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, urticaria, night sweats, and pruritus were more common in the ofatumumab group. Basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas were reported in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 2% in the ofatumumab group; nonskin cancers were seen in 3% and 1% of the patients, respectively. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events occurred in 4% of the patients in each study group. Fatal events occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 5% of those in the ofatumumab group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). These events were most commonly infectious in nature. Adverse events resulting in dose reductions occurred in 4% of the patients treated with ibrutinib, with only diarrhea (which occurred in three patients) leading to a dose reduction in more than one patient. Changes in creatinine levels from baseline were similar in the two study groups, with a decrease in creatinine clearance of any grade observed in 16% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 17% of those in the ofatumumab group. Among patients with relapsed CLL or SLL, including those who had a short duration of response to prior therapy or who had adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, ibrutinib was superior to ofatumumab with respect to progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate at a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The positive effect of ibrutinib was observed in subgroups of patients with a high-risk chromosome 17p13.1 deletion and with resistance to previous purine analogue therapy. Similar benefits with respect to progression-free survival were observed regardless of age, clinical stage, and factors such as status with respect to mutations in IGHV. The effect of ibrutinib on overall survival was significant, an effect that was robust despite the crossover of 57 patients to the ibrutinib group after they had disease progression while receiving ofatumumab; this effect was also observed in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Except for a few differences, our findings are largely similar to those of other trials of ibrutinib or ofatumumab. ',\n"," 'In each of the two groups in our study, the response rate as determined by independent assessors was lower than the response rate as determined by investigators. In the phase 2 study of ibrutinib monotherapy, in which response was assessed by investigators, the response rate was 71%, which is similar to the 70% response rate assessed by investigators in our study. The independently assessed response rate in the ofatumumab group in our study appears to be lower than that in the pivotal study that was based on 1996 National Cancer Institute guidelines for CLL, which did not require CT scanning to confirm response. This difference may be due in part to the requirement in our study for serial CT scanning, which was performed every 12 weeks, to confirm response. Another ofatumumab study that compared response assessment between patients who underwent CT scanning and those who did not undergo CT scanning showed substantial differences in the rates of response between the two subgroups, with lower response rates seen in the group that underwent CT scanning. Furthermore, the investigator-assessed response rate among patients in the ofatumumab group in our study (21%) was similar to the rate (23%) in a recent study that used 2008 criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Reassuringly, the results with respect to progression-free survival in the ofatumumab group in our study (median, 8.1 months) are similar to those in historical reports (median, approximately 6 months). Previous reports of ofatumumab therapy showed that patients with refractory CLL had a median survival of 12 months and 15 months, with no plateau in deaths. With a median follow- up of 9.4 months in our study, an early separation in the curves for overall survival favored ibrutinib; however, the median was not reached in either study group. At later time points, the survival curve for ofatumumab began to flatten, which may in part be a reflection of the influence of ibrutinib on patients in the ofatumumab group who crossed over to ibrutinib therapy. Ibrutinib was associated with toxic effects that were expected on the basis of the results of phase 2 studies. It appears that the drug can be safely administered even in a heavily pretreated and elderly population with baseline coexisting conditions, such as the one in our study. ',\n"," 'In the ibrutinib group, 32% of the patients had a decreased creatinine clearance, 64% had cytopenias, and 32% had a score on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale of more than 6 (ranging from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating worse health status). Toxic effects did not result in frequent dose reductions or treatment discontinuations. One strength of a randomized, controlled trial is that background disease-related complications may be differentiated from a treatment effect with a new agent. However, it is important to note that patients in the ibrutinib group had a reporting period for adverse events that was more than 3 months longer than that in the ofatumumab group (median duration, 8.6 months vs. 5.3 months), and no exposure-adjusted analysis of adverse events was performed. The frequencies of renal complications and increased creatinine levels were similar in the two study groups. Although the overall rate of infections was higher in the ibrutinib group, the frequency of infections of grade 3 or higher did not differ significantly between the two groups. Ocular symptoms were collected proactively and were reported more frequently among patients in the ibrutinib group, including a small proportion of patients who reported blurred vision. The development of cataracts in 3% of the patients receiving ibrutinib (as compared with 1% in the control group) bears noting, since longer exposure may be associated with an increased risk. Atrial fibrillation of any grade was noted in 10 patients in the ibrutinib group, as compared with 1 patient in the ofatumumab group, and led to the discontinuation of ibrutinib in 1 patient. Potential reasons for the higher rate of atrial fibrillation among patients receiving ibrutinib are being explored. In clinical studies in which serial electrocardiographic studies were performed, no evidence of arrhythmias was observed among patients receiving ibrutinib. An adverse event of interest with ibrutinib from early studies was major hemorrhage, including subdural hematoma. In our study, we excluded patients requiring warfarin but not those requiring other forms of anticoagulation. The rate of major hemorrhage was similar in the two study groups, with one subdural hematoma noted in a patient receiving ibrutinib. Although mild bleeding episodes were more common in the ibrutinib group, adherence to appropriate drug-withholding guidelines perioperatively and precautions regarding the use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants resulted in no unexpected major bleeding complications in the ibrutinib group. ',\n"," \"Further studies of the mechanism of bleeding, including bruising, that was observed among patients receiving ibrutinib have been conducted or are planned. In conclusion, ibrutinib was superior to ofatumumab in difficult-to-treat patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, as measured by progression-free survival, overall survival, and response. The improvement was observed across all subgroups that were examined, including patients who were resistant to chemoimmunotherapy and those with a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, which confirms single-agent ibrutinib as an effective therapy for CLL or SLL. Phase 3 studies examining the effect of ibrutinib in previously untreated patients with CLL or SLL are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02048813 and NCT01722487).

A treatment-induced rise in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has emerged as a class effect of kinase inhibitors in CLL and warrants further investigation. We here report correlative studies in 64 patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. We quantified tumor burden in blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, assessed phenotypic changes of circulating cells, and measured whole blood viscosity. With just one dose of ibrutinib the average increase in ALC was 66%, and in over 40% of patients the ALC peaked within 24 hours of initiating treatment. Circulating CLL cells on day 2 showed increased Ki67 and CD38 expression, indicating an efflux of tumor cells from the tissue compartments into the blood. The kinetics and degree of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable; interestingly in patients with a high baseline ALC the relative increase was mild and resolution rapid. After two cycles of treatment the disease burden in lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen decreased irrespective of the relative change in ALC. Whole blood viscosity was dependent on both ALC and hemoglobin. No adverse events were attributed to the lymphocytosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a malignancy of mature B-cells that involves blood, bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, is the most common leukemia in western countries. In the US alone ~120 000 people live with CLL, while an estimated 15 680 people will be newly diagnosed with, and 4 580 will die of CLL in 2013. Median survival with early stage disease is 10.7 years; however, the clinical course is quite heterogeneous, depending on prognostic markers like Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Variable (IGHV) gene mutation status, ZAP70 expression, deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) or presence of SF3B1 and NOTCH1 mutations. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has emerged as a key pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL. A role for antigenic stimulation of the clonal cells was first indicated by the observation that CLL cells use a restricted repertoire of IGHV genes that encode the antigen interacting interface of the BCR. More recently, the discovery of BCR stereotypes shared by a substantial proportion of CLL cases, suggests that CLL cells may arise from B-cells with defined antigen specificities. BCR signaling and activation of the NF-kappaB pathway occur primarily in the lymph node microenvironment promoting cell growth, proliferation, and survival. ',\n"," \"Thus, antigenic stimulation emerges as a driving pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL; a mechanism that is also implicated in an increasing number of mature B-cell malignancies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is recruited early in the BCR signaling cascade in conjunction with SYK and PI3Kdelta. BTK couples BCR activation to intracellular calcium release and activation of NF-kappaB and is essential for normal B-cell development and response of B-cells to antigenic stimulation. Knockdown of BTK is lethal to select lymphoma cell lines derived from activated B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and decreases the viability of primary CLL cells. In addition, genetic ablation of BTK inhibits disease progression in mouse models of CLL. Ibrutinib, an orally active agent, covalently binds to Cys-481 of BTK thereby irreversibly inactivating the kinase. In the phase I study, ibrutinib was well tolerated and active across a spectrum of mature B-cell malignancies, with the highest response rates in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). More recently, overall response rates of >70%, and an estimated 26 month progression free survival rate of 75% for previously treated patients with CLL was reported. In vitro ibrutinib has been shown to inhibit proliferation, adhesion and migration of CLL cells. Further, murine CLL models suggest that ibrutinib inhibits homing of CLL cells to tissue sites. In addition to ibrutinib, several other inhibitors of kinases in the BCR pathway are in clinical development. Initial clinical experience with such BCR inhibitors raised concerns due to a sometimes dramatic worsening of peripheral lymphocytosis, which is now recognized as a class effect. Concerns about patient safety due to the treatment-induced lymphocytosis have been somewhat alleviated by the increasing experience with these agents in clinical trials. However, many questions remain. Here we focused on the kinetics and inter-individual variability in treatment-induced lymphocytosis, characterized changes in the immune-phenotype of circulating CLL cells on treatment, assessed concomitant changes in disease distribution in different anatomic compartments, and sequentially determined whole blood viscosity during the period of peak lymphocytosis. We found that the ibrutinib induced lymphocytosis developed almost immediately after the first dose of drug, peaked within 24 hours in many patients, and showed pronounced inter-patient variability. We provide direct in vivo evidence that the initial rise in lymphocytosis is in large part due to the release of previously activated cells from the lymph node. \",\n"," 'drug, peaked within 24 hours in many patients, and showed pronounced inter-patient variability. We provide direct in vivo evidence that the initial rise in lymphocytosis is in large part due to the release of previously activated cells from the lymph node. Furthermore, substantial reductions in tumor burden in lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen independent of changes in the number of circulating CLL cells underscores the notion that in CLL patients treated with BCR inhibitors, the ALC is not a valid surrogate of overall disease burden or activity. We report correlative analyses on 64 CLL patients enrolled between January 2012 and October 2013 in our ongoing, investigator-initiated phase II study of ibrutinib (NCT01500733). The study was approved by the local ethics committee; informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory patients with either del(17p) or age >=65 years were eligible (Table 1) and treated with ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of intolerable side effects. Mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene was assessed as described and CLL with <2% mutations was classified as unmutated. Complete blood counts were determined in the NIH central laboratory. Groups of patients having distinct patterns of treatment-induced lymphocytosis (in regards to degree of change in ALC, and the kinetics of onset and resolution) were identified using hierarchical clustering (Eisen Laboratory, Stanford University, CA). Whole blood viscosity was determined by quantitative viscometry of whole blood (ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE v 4.03. Tumor volume in spleen and lymph node was computed from CT scans using syngovia software (Siemens, Cary, NC). Of the spleen volume, 70% was considered due to CLL cells. Bone marrow volume was calculated as previously published, and the content of CLL cells was calculated from the overall marrow cellularity multiplied by the degree of CLL cell infiltration. Cellular density was estimated at 109 cells/ml based on measurements of thymocyte density. Peripheral blood volume was calculated using the Nadler formula. The number of CLL cells was calculated based on measured ALC and the percentage of CD19+ cells among all lymphocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared by density-gradient centrifugation (Lymphocyte Separation Media; ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Lymph node derived single cell suspensions were obtained from core biopsies. ',\n"," \"Cell suspensions were stained as previously described (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For Ki67 staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 70% EtOH. To assess cell death fresh whole blood samples were collected, red cells were removed by ACK lysis, and CLL cell viability was assessed with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Cells were analyzed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACS-DIVA 6.1.1 and FlowJo software (Version 8.8.6; TreeStar, Ashland, OR). When comparing patient groups, a linear model was applied (JMP10 software, SAS Inc, Cary, NC). When comparing specific events among patient groups a Fisher's exact test was used. All other statistical analyses were by Student's T-test (Prism5, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). To test the hypothesis that the treatment-related increase in ALC is due to efflux of CLL cells from the lymph node, the predicted percentage of CLL cells expressing Ki67 (Ki67T PB) on day 2 was calculated from the change in ALC and the measured percentage of CLL cells expressing Ki67 pre-treatment in peripheral blood (KI67 PB pre) and lymph node (Ki67 LN pre):  Within 24 hours of initiating ibrutinib the mean baseline ALC of 105 000/muL increased on average by 66% (P<0.001) and continued to increase throughout the first cycle before it gradually declined (Figure 1a and b). Within four hours of starting treatment the mean ALC had already increased in most patients (data not shown). Thus, the onset of ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis was virtually immediate and in many patients reached its peak within days; in 46% of patients on day 2 and in 78% by day 28 (Figure 1c). The magnitude of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable between patients (Figure 1d), without any correlation to prior treatment history or the presence of absence of del(17p) (Supplementary Figure S1a-d). However, patients with IGHV mutated CLL showed a more pronounced rise in ALC that resolved more slowly than in patients with IGHV unmutated CLL (P<0.001; Supplementary Figure S1e-f). To test for factors that might predict distinct patterns of lymphocytosis, we used an unsupervised clustering analysis of the relative change in ALC over the first 6 months on treatment compared to baseline. Three separate clusters of patients that differ in the degree and the kinetics of the lymphocytosis were identified (Figure 2a-c). \",\n"," \"Notably, the pre-treatment ALC was significantly different between the three clusters (P<0.002, Figure 2d). The mean pre-treatment ALC was highest for patients in cluster 1 and in this group of patients the treatment-induced lymphocytosis peaked within days and resolved rapidly. Conversely, patients in cluster 3 tended to have lower pre-treatment ALC and showed a greater relative increase in lymphocytosis that developed and resolved more slowly. Compared to the other clusters, cluster 3 was enriched for patients having IGHV mutated CLL and bulky lymphadenopathy (at least one node with largest diameter >5 cm; Table 2). Conversely, patients in cluster 1 frequently had advanced Rai stage (80%). Thus, it appears that CLL patients with moderate lymphadenopathy may have a shorter time to peak ALC and a faster resolution of lymphocytosis, while bulky disease was here associated with more prolonged lymphocytosis. Notably, there was no significant difference in the degree of nodal response at 6 months among the three clusters (Table 2), suggesting that a prolonged lymphocytosis does not predict for inferior response; in agreement with a recent report by Woyach et al. We estimated a patient's total disease burden from the ALC, the extent of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly on CT scans, and the degree of bone marrow infiltration. Figure 3 summarizes data for four representative patients. The distribution of disease among the different anatomic compartments varied greatly between individual patients (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 1). During treatment, we repeatedly assessed the tumor burden in these sites for four patients chosen to represent cases with both diverse involvement of the four compartments pre-treatment and different kinetics of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis. The aggregate volume of lymphadenopathy as calculated from CT scans is shown for a representative patient in Figure 3b; ibrutinib reduced the pre-treatment lymph node volume of 3 161 mL (equal to an estimated 3.2x1012 CLL cells) by >80% within two months, with continued improvement at 6 months. Similarly, ibrutinib also rapidly reduced the tumor burden in the spleen (Figure 3c). The degree of bone marrow infiltration was estimated from anti-CD79a stained bone marrow biopsies (Figure 3d). Irrespective of the initial tumor distribution, all four representative patients showed a pronounced decrease in the number of CLL cells over time, with the most rapid decrease occurring during the first two months (Figure 3e). \",\n"," 'One patient showed an apparent increase in the total number of CLL cells at 2 months despite reductions in disease burden in all three tissue sites due to a pronounced increase in ALC. This likely reflects release of CLL cells from the liver and intestinal tract, sites known to be significant reservoirs of B-cells, but not included in our model. The substantial reduction in total tumor burden cannot be explained by mere disease redistribution between different anatomic sites and suggests that there is a substantial amount of treatment-induced cell death. For example in three of the four patients shown in Figure 3e trillions of CLL cells \"disappear\" within the first two months; and that is only from the four sites amenable to study. However, evidence of cell death has been elusive. For example none of the patients in our study showed signs of tumor lysis syndrome, and in ficolled, viably frozen PBMCs we failed to detect an increase in cell death or apoptosis. When we switched to analyzing fresh whole blood samples we found that pre-treatment a median 2.4% of the circulating tumor cells were dead or dying. On day 28 on ibrutinib the frequency of dead or dying cells in circulation on average more than doubled compared to pre-treatment (P=0.03; Figure 3f). In vitro and murine studies suggest that both inhibition of cell adhesion and homing of circulating cells to tissue sites may contribute to treatment-induced lymphocytosis in CLL. Based on the rapid onset of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis, we hypothesized that efflux of CLL cells from tissue sites fuels the rise in circulating cells. To distinguish CLL cells in circulation from tissue-resident cells we made use of prior observations that CLL cells are activated and proliferate in the tissue microenvironment, and the two populations therefore differ in their immuno-phenotypic characteristics (Figure 4a). Expression of activation markers, including CD38, CD69, and CD86, and the proliferation marker Ki67 have been found to be downregulated by BCR inhibitors. As expected we found downregulation of these markers on circulating tumor cells on day 14 of ibrutinib therapy (data not shown). However, on day 2 concurrent with the increase in ALC the frequency of CD38 and Ki67 positive CLL cells in circulation increased significantly (P<=0.004, Figure 4b-c, and Supplementary Figure S2a) consistent with an influx of tissue resident cells into the blood. ',\n"," 'Next we used the relative change in ALC and in the fraction of circulating cells expressing Ki67 on day 2 to estimate to what degree the influx of tissue resident cells can account for the rise in ALC. Figure 4d illustrates these changes in a representative patient. The fraction of Ki67 expressing CLL cells as measured by flow cytometry pre-treatment was 6.4% in the peripheral blood and 12.8% in the lymph node. On day 2 the ALC had increased from 90 000/ul to 128 000/ul. Thus one third of the cells on day 2 were \"additional cells\". If all these additional cells are derived from the lymph node, the frequency of Ki67 positive cells is predicted to increase to 8.3%. Indeed the actual frequency measured by flow cytometry was 8.2%. We could assess eight patients in this manner and consistently, actual and predicted frequency of Ki67 expressing cells were virtually identical (R=0.99, P<0.001; Figure 4e). Using this same formula, we could also predict the expected rise in ALC based on the pre-treatment and day 2 Ki67 values (R=0.99, P<0.001; Figure 4f). Thus, the treatment-induced rise in ALC on day 2 can be accounted for by the influx of lymph-node resident CLL cells into the blood. Patients with certain types of leukemia may develop leukostasis leading to central nervous system and respiratory impairment. CLL patients, even those with very high lymphocyte counts, are rarely reported to suffer such complications; however, the rapid increase in ALC and the release of more activated cells from tissue sites might contribute an additional risk. Fortunately, no adverse events were attributed to leukostasis or hyperviscosity syndrome in this study, where the highest ALC was 475 000/mul, and 42% of patients had an ALC greater than 200 000/mul at least once during the first two months. Prospectively measured whole blood viscosity pre-treatment and on days 2 and 28 correlated with ALC, but did so even more strongly with hemoglobin (P<0.001, Figure 5a and b). Overall, there was no significant increase in whole blood viscosity on treatment (Figure 5c). Only in two patients a slightly increased whole blood viscosity was recorded, in one patient on day 2 with an ALC of 405 000/mul and in the other on day 28 with an ALC of 388 000/mul. ALC and hemoglobin were inversely correlated and patients with high ALC tended to be more anemic (Supplementary Figure S3). ',\n"," 'Interestingly, in patients with a pre-treatment hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL there was a decrease in mean hemoglobin from 11.7 to 10.9 g/dL during the first 28 days on treatment (P <= 0.02, Figure 5d). Figure 5e illustrates the interaction of hemoglobin and ALC on whole blood viscosity. Notably, the effect of a high ALC may in part be offset by a degree of anemia. Treatment-induced lymphocytosis has become a hallmark of BCR inhibitors in CLL. Here we report clinical and biologic aspects of ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis in patients with CLL; we show that the rise in ALC is virtually immediate, driven by the efflux of cells from tissue compartments, and paralleled by a substantial decrease in total tumor burden. In prospective measurements of whole blood viscosity we identified a small subset of patients in whom whole blood viscosity can exceed the normal range. However, no clinical adverse events were attributed to the lymphocytosis. Prior studies have reported treatment-induced lymphocytosis with BCR inhibitors within weeks of initiating treatment. Here we show that the onset of lymphocytosis occurs within hours of the first dose of ibrutinib and identify a group of patients in whom the lymphocytosis peaks within the first days and resolves before the end of the first cycle. The variability in degree and kinetics of the ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis in our cohort appears to be somewhat more heterogeneous than seen in other studies. While we included both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory patients of all age groups, and a large proportion of patients having del(17p), none of these characteristics predicted kinetics or degree of lymphocytosis. Of practical consequence is the observation that patients with a high pre-treatment ALC tend to have a rapid but relatively modest rise in ALC followed by fast resolution of the leukemic disease. Conversely, the group of patients showing a slow but continuous rise in ALC also had slow resolution of leukemic disease, had lower ALC pre-treatment, a higher proportion of patients with bulky disease, and commonly had IGHV mutated CLL. Thus, patients in this group would be predicted to have a more indolent course and extended benefit of treatment, at least with conventional chemoimmunotherapy. Therefore, as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease in other sites, it seems appropriate to continue treatment and await the eventual resolution of the lymphocytosis. ',\n"," 'Overall, compared to patients with IGHV unmutated CLL patients with IGHV mutated CLL had a greater relative increase in ALC and slower resolution of lymphocytosis confirming an earlier report. While IGHV mutated patients may therefore have lower response rates by IWCLL criteria, Woyach et al. recently showed that patients with persistent lymphocytosis have a similar PFS compared to those who reach an IWCLL objective response within the first year. In accordance with this, we did not find a significant difference in the degree of nodal response at 6 months among the three clusters, further suggesting that a prolonged lymphocytosis does not indicate an inferior response. Resolution of lymphadenopathy concurrent with the rise in ALC has been a strong indication that treatment-induced lymphocytosis is not a sign of progressive disease but reflects redistribution of tumor cells between different anatomic compartments. Here we present for the first time direct evidence that the initial rapid rise in ALC is driven by the release of CLL cells from tissues, in particular from the lymph node. This conclusion is based on the increased frequency of CLL cells expressing Ki67 and CD38 in the blood within 24 hours of starting ibrutinib and supported by a mathematical model derived from in vivo measurements in both blood and lymph node resident cells (Figure 4d). At least in the first 24h the bulk of cells released into the blood appear to come from the lymph node but we cannot rule out that some cells also egress from the bone marrow or other tissue sites. While several markers have been reported to be differentially expressed between CLL cells in the blood and tissues, not all are suitable to assess shifts in cell populations on ibrutinib. For example the activation markers CD69 and CD86 are so rapidly downregulated by ibrutinib that they cannot identify different cell populations once treatment is initiated. In contrast, we observed an increase of CXCR4 expression on CLL cells during treatment with ibrutinib (data not shown), which precludes the identification of the CXCR4dim/CD5bright population reported by Calissano et al. Similarly, on continued treatment both Ki67 and CD38 are downregulated by BCR inhibitors. Therefore, we could not distinguish different cell populations at later time-points. ',\n"," 'Thus, while we show that an efflux of cells from the tissue into the blood accounted for the observed rise in ALC by day 2, we cannot asses to what degree reduced homing of CLL cells to the tissue may contribute to the persistence of the lymphocytosis. However, the latter mechanism may contribute to the drop in ALC during treatment interruptions as seen in early studies that cycled ibrutinib 4 weeks on, one week off. Leukostasis is a rarely reported complication of CLL. However, in some settings the treatment-induced worsening of lymphocytosis has raised concerns about patient safety. We therefore prospectively incorporated whole blood viscosity measurements. Clinically we did not observe any symptoms or signs suggestive of leukostasis. Further, whole blood viscosity was only slightly elevated in two patients. While our experience is limited in patients with ALC greater than 300 000, the positive correlation between ALC and whole blood viscosity suggests that blood flow may be altered at very high ALCs especially in patients with normal hemoglobin (Figure 5e). The fact that most patients with high ALC had hemoglobin <10 g/dL could in part account for their normal viscosity readings and may justify withholding administration of blood products in patients with high ALC. Treatment-induced lymphocytosis has attracted considerable attention. However, in most patients, the circulating CLL cells are only a minor fraction of the total tumor volume. Importantly, the bulk of the disease, located in tissue sites such as bone marrow, lymph node, spleen and likely the intestinal tract, is substantially decreased on ibrutinib (Figure 3). Also, 27% of patients already had a reduction in ALC below baseline by two weeks. Thus, in most patients there is a rapid reduction in total tumor burden indicating an increased rate of cell death on ibrutinib. In fresh whole blood samples obtained pre-treatment we identified a median 2.4% of the circulating tumor cells as dead or dying, which is within the range of the previously calculated daily death rates in untreated CLL patients using heavy water labeling. Our measurements suggest that the frequency of dead or dying cells in circulation more than doubled on ibrutinib (Figure 3f). As dead cells are constantly cleared through the reticuloendothelial system this is most consistent with an increased death rate. ',\n"," 'An absolute increase in the rate of cell death by 2% per day would result in a >50% reduction in tumor burden within 28 days, which is in good agreement with the initial kinetics of tumor response seen in many patients. In addition, inhibition of tumor proliferation by ibrutinib, as reported elsewhere, will prevent or reduce the replacement of the dying cells. A slow but steady decay rate of the tumor is also in accordance with the notable absence of reports of tumor lysis syndrome with single agent ibrutinib, and the modest degree of apoptosis induced by ibrutinib in vitro. As BCR inhibitors decrease NF-kappaB signaling and expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2A1, cell death may be a consequence of reduced pro-survival signaling rather than of a direct cytotoxic effect. However, this remains to be more fully evaluated. Ibrutinib is active in several mature B-cell malignancies. Notably, patients with MCL also frequently experience treatment-induced lymphocytosis. Although the mechanisms leading to redistribution of disease may be similar to those in CLL, patterns of lymphocytosis in MCL and their relation to clinical response and patient safety need to be independently studied. Results presented here support the positive benefit to risk profile of continued ibrutinib treatment for most patients with CLL showing treatment-induced lymphocytosis. In fact, treatment-induced lymphocytosis in CLL may be viewed as an on-target effect of BCR inhibitors, with the caveat that it may be missed as the peak can occur within the first days or even hours of starting ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) patients with purine analogue refractory disease or TP53 dysfunction still have limited treatment options and poor survival. Alemtuzumab containing chemoimmunotherapy regimens can be effective but frequently cause serious infections. We report a phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of a short duration regimen combining pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low dose high frequency rituximab (PAR) designed to decrease the risk of treatment associated infections and limit loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. The study enrolled 39 patients with progressive CLL that was either relapsed/refractory (n=36) or previously untreated with 17p13 deletion (17p13-)(n=3). Thirteen (33%) patients had both 17p13- and TP53 mutations predicted to be dysfunctional and eight patients had purine analogue refractory CLL without TP53 dysfunction. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed therapy with only five (13%) patients having treatment limiting toxicity, and no treatment related deaths. Twenty-two (56%) patients responded to treatment with 11 (28%) complete responses (four with incomplete bone marrow recovery). Median progression free survival was 7.2 months, time to next treatment 9.1 months, and overall survival 34.1 months. The majority of deaths (82%) were caused by progressive disease including transformed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n=6). Correlative studies showed that low dose rituximab activates complement and NK cells without a profound and sustained decrease in expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. We conclude that PAR is a tolerable and effective therapy for CLL and that low dose rituximab therapy can activate innate immune cytotoxic mechanisms without substantially decreasing CD20 expression. Patients with purine analogue refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and progressive disease with TP53 dysfunction have limited treatment options and poor survival. Although alemtuzumab monotherapy is often effective at clearing CLL cells in the circulation and bone marrow, patients with bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly rarely achieve durable responses. Alemtuzumab is also an effective therapy against CLL cells with TP53 dysfunction (deletion/mutation), although complete remissions are rare and progression free survival is usually short. Alemtuzumab has thus been combined with other drugs in order to improve efficacy. Alemtuzumab and rituximab is effective and tolerable but also has limited efficacy against bulky disease. Combination therapy with alemtuzumab and fludarabine has been reported to be more effective than fludarabine monotherapy but there are concerns about the safety of these chemoimmunotherapy regimens because of excess mortality for both patients undergoing their first therapy for progressive disease and those treated for relapsed/refractory disease. ',\n"," 'A safer and more effective chemoimmunotherapy regimen could be of value for patients with very high risk progressive CLL. We conducted a phase II clinical trial to test whether a combination therapy with pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and lower dose higher frequency rituximab (PAR) could be effective and tolerable for patients with relapsed/refractory or progressive CLL with 17p13 deletion (17p13-) and could limit loss of CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells. Pentostatin was included in the regimen with the aim of decreasing CLL tumor bulk by targeting the residual purine analogue sensitive clones of the CLL cell population with a drug that could have less myelotoxicity than fludarabine. The rituximab administration schedule was based on data showing that lower dose and higher frequency therapy can decrease the loss of CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells that occurs with standard dose rituximab therapy. The duration of the therapy regimen was limited to three months to reduce the risk of prolonged immunosuppression. Our study shows that PAR is an effective and tolerable therapy for this patient population and that use of low dose rituximab decreases trogocytosis (\"shaving\") and thus loss of expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. This two-stage phase II clinical trial was conducted at the Mayo Clinic Rochester and University of Iowa with the approval of both Institutional Review Boards according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00669318). Patients were eligible for accrual if they had a diagnosis of progressive CLL (including the small lymphocytic lymphoma variant) by standard criteria and either had been previously treated for CLL (no more than three purine analogue containing regimens) or were previously untreated for their CLL and had 17p13- detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Exclusion criteria were organ failure (creatinine >2x upper limit of normal (ULN), direct hyperbilirubinemia or AST >3x ULN, >class II New York Heart Association heart failure, or an ECOG performance status >3), infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C, active autoimmune cytopenia, and alemtuzumab therapy <2 months previously. Prognostic factor analysis was determined using FISH analysis of peripheral blood, IGHV mutation analysis, TP53 mutation analysis, and expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 as previously described. Therapy started with rituximab 20 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (M-W-F). ',\n"," 'second dose of rituximab with a daily dose escalation of 3-10-30 mg/d if tolerated and was then administered at 30 mg SQ M-W-F starting on day 8. Pentostatin 2 mg/m2 IV was started on day 8 and repeated every 2 weeks. The first cycle of therapy included the week of alemtuzumab dose escalation and 4 subsequent weeks of full dose therapy for a total of 5 weeks. Subsequent cycles were 4 weeks of full dose therapy. Leukocyte growth factor (pegfilgrastim 6 mg SQ x 1 day or GM-CSF 500 mug/d SQ x 5 days) administration was started 48 hours after each dose of pentostatin and all patients had Pneumocystis and herpes virus prophylaxis during therapy and then for 6 months after the last dose of alemtuzumab. Blood cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral assays were done using a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method weekly during treatment with alemtuzumab and all patients with detectable CMV viremia were treated with either valganciclovir or ganciclovir. Patients tolerating therapy and without disease progression received a minimum of 2 cycles of PAR therapy. After completing 2 cycles of therapy, those patients who had achieved a complete clinical response underwent a CT scan of their chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with no pathological radiological findings then underwent a bone marrow study to test for residual CLL. If the bone marrow biopsy showed no morphological evidence of residual CLL, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (see below for details) was performed to evaluate for residual CLL cells. Those patients with an IHC negative (stringent) complete response (CR) had no further therapy. All other patients without progressive disease received a 3rd cycle of therapy. Patients were evaluated by physical examination and blood testing one week after starting therapy, subsequently every 2 weeks during treatment, monthly for 6 months after completing therapy, and then at 9 and 12 months after completing therapy. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 http://ctep.cancer.gov/ with the exception of cytopenias which were graded using the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicity in CLL studies. Response to treatment was measured 2 months after completion of therapy using standard National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 (NCI-WG96) criteria. ',\n"," 'In patients who achieved a complete clinical remission by NCI-WG96 criteria, the bone marrow biopsy was evaluated for residual CLL cells by IHC studies (streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method) with antibodies directed against CD3, CD5, CD23 and PAX5 using standard techniques. The specific focus of the correlative studies was to examine the effects of the first week of therapy with low dose rituximab (20 mg/m2 IV) on circulating CLL cells. Four peripheral blood samples were drawn from each patient: Sample 1 on day 1 of therapy prior to the first dose of rituximab, sample 2 on day 3 before therapy (48 hours after the first dose of rituximab), sample 3 on day 3 one hour after completion of therapy (rituximab infusion followed by SQ alemtuzumab injection), and sample 4 before treatment on day 8 of therapy. Immunophenotypic analyses on CLL cells were performed on the first 13 evaluable patients based on analyses starting with whole blood as previously described. These assays were performed within three days of the blood draw. Alternatively, in the next group of 18 patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated within 2 hours of the blood draw and were then frozen and stored at -150 C as previously described. The PBMC were subsequently thawed in AIM V media (Gibco) and analyzed as above except that the erythrocyte lysis step was omitted. Due to minor adjustments in the blood specimen collection protocols, the absolute lymphocyte counts were measured only in the first and fourth blood sample in the first group of patients, but absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were determined for all four freshly isolated blood samples for the second group of patients. Finally, in certain cases only three (of four) blood samples were obtained for some patients, and therefore the number of data points for specific times in the figures varied slightly. All immunophenotypic assays were run in duplicate. CLL cells were identified as low side scatter, PerCP CD45+ (BD Pharmingen), and PE CD19+ (eBioscience). Levels of CD20 on CLL cells were measured as previously described by probing with ofatumumab or rituximab, followed by secondary development with Al488-labeled mAb HB43, specific for human Fc (American Type Tissue Collection). Deposition of complement C3d fragments was measured with Al488-labeled mAb 1H8. FITC-labeled mAbs specific for complement control proteins CD46 and CD59 were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Monoclonal antibody HD1A, specific for CD55, was the kind gift of Prof. ',\n"," \"Paul Morgan, University of Wales, Cardiff. Certain monoclonal antibodies, including HD1A, were labeled by reaction with Alexa 488 N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the manufacturers' directions (Molecular Probes). In order to test for a correlation between deposited levels of C3d and expression of CD20, a subset of Day 3 Post PBMC samples were first incubated with ofatumumab, washed, and then probed with a cocktail of FITC mAb 1H8, PE CD19, PerCP CD45 and Al647 HB43. Unless otherwise noted, all results for these measurements are normalized to values obtained for the blood samples taken just before the first rituximab infusion. The results for the fresh and frozen samples are plotted in the same figures, but different symbols are used to identify CLL cells that were evaluated in either whole blood (open circles) or as PBMC (closed circles). In a few patients, levels of CD20 in the pre-treatment blood samples were very low (less than 5% of the median levels for the other patients, likely because of recent rituximab treatment), or ALC were less than 5 x 109/L, and these blood samples were not included in the analyses. NK cells were evaluated in blood specimens, taken before and 48 hours after the first dose of rituximab, for changes in numbers as well as expression of CD16 and CD54 as previously described. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from blood by Ficoll separation and red blood cells lysed with ACK buffer. 2 x 106 mononuclear cells were stained with CD54-PE, CD56-A647, CD16-FITC, CD3-APC-Cy7 and CD19-PE-Cy7, fixed and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson LSR II for changes in the percentage counts and expression of CD16 and CD54. This study used a two-stage Simon optimum design with a primary endpoint of CR rate as defined by the NCI-WG96 criteria. The secondary end points were to determine the overall response rate, toxicity of treatment, time to subsequent therapy, and overall and progression free survival. Based on our experience with treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL and patients with progressive disease and 17p13-, we proposed that the largest CR rate where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population was 10%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population would be 30%. A total of 38 evaluable patients provided 93% power, with a 7% Type I error rate. \",\n"," 'The progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. Time to subsequent therapy (TTT) is defined as the time from registration to the time of initiation of subsequent therapy for progressive CLL. Patients who underwent allogeneic transplant or received subsequent treatment before meeting criteria for disease progression were censored for TTT. The distribution of all time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier and differences between subgroups were evaluated using log-rank statistics. The results of rituximab infusions on cell phenotype were evaluated by the Wilcoxin signed-rank test and relationships between continuous variables were examined based on Spearman rank order correlation (Sigma stat). Forty-one patients were enrolled from July 2008 to February 2013 and 39 were evaluable. Two patients did not start treatment. One patient was found to have concomitant Hodgkin lymphoma and the other a serious systemic infection during pre-treatment evaluation. The characteristics of the 39 evaluable patients are summarized in Table I. Complete prior therapy records were available for 34 of the 36 previously treated patients. Of these, 29 (85%) had previously received purine analogue based chemoimmunotherapy. Thirteen (45%) patients were considered to be purine analogue refractory because they had not responded to (n=12), or had a PFS of less than one year following their most recent purine analogue containing chemoimmunotherapy regimen (n=1). Thirty-four (94%) patients had previously received rituximab-based therapy and 8 (22%) had previously received alemtuzumab. TP53 was evaluated by FISH analysis for deletion in all patients and for mutations predicted to be dysfunctional in exons 4-9 by sequencing in 34 patients including all 15 patients with 17p13-. TP53 mutations were detected in 18 (53%) of evaluated patients. Of these patients 13 (72%) also had 17p13- and were thus presumed to have loss of TP53 function (TP53 dysfunction) in the affected CLL cells. Five patients had TP53 mutations without 17p13- and two had 17p13- without detection of a TP53 mutation in the remaining allele. Two patients had both 17p13- and 11q22- in the same CLL clone as previously described, and of these, one also had a TP53 mutation. IGHV analysis showed somatic hypermutation in three (23%) of 13 patients with both 17p13- and TP53 mutation, and two of five patients without 17p13- who had TP53 mutation. ',\n"," 'Both patients with 17p13- and no detected TP53 mutation had unmutated IGHV. Twenty one (54%) patients on this study had very-high risk CLL based on predicted loss of TP53 function (n=13) or purine analogue refractory disease in the absence of evidence of TP53 dysfunction (n=8). Of the 13 patients with purine analogue refractory CLL, 5 (38%) had both a TP53 mutation and 17p13-, one had a TP53 mutation without 17p13-, three had 11q22-, and three were not tested for TP53 mutations. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed all planned therapy including two patients who completed therapy per protocol after two cycles because they had achieved an IHC negative CR. Of the 13 patients who did not complete the planned therapy, four patients received only one cycle, five received two cycles, and four started but did not complete the third cycle of therapy. The reasons for not completing therapy were disease progression (n=4), adverse events (n=5), treating physician and patient choice (n=1), financial hardship (n=1), change to alternative therapy regimen (n=1), and diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma (n=1). There were 28 therapy delays in 23 patients because of adverse events (n=24) and for administrative reasons (n=4). There were no dose reductions for alemtuzumab or rituximab. Pentostatin doses were omitted 17 times in 11 patients and reduced five times in five patients because of adverse events. There were 57 grade 3-4 adverse events at least possibly related to treatment in 27 patients. Of these 22 were neutropenia, 11 were thrombocytopenia, and 8 were infections/febrile neutropenia. Other grade 3-4 hematological events were anemia (n=2), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)(n=2), hemorrhage (n=2), aplastic anemia (n=1), fatigue (n=3), fever (n=3), myalgia (n=1), hypotension (n=1) and hyperuricemia (n=1). There were no deaths attributable to treatment. CMV reactivation occurred in 14 (36%) patients with a median viral load of 2,000 copies/ml (maximum 34,500), and was first detected in cycle 1 of therapy in 10 patients and cycle 2 of therapy in four patients. Eight patients had only one positive test for CMV viremia, five had positive tests for two sequential weeks, and one had positive tests for three sequential weeks. All patients were treated and there were no grade 3-4 events attributable to CMV reactivation, and no interruptions in treatment. AIHA occurred for the first time in two patients during therapy with PAR. ',\n"," \"One patient developed AIHA in cycle 1 of therapy three days after his first dose of pentostatin and the other during cycle 3 of therapy. Both patients responded well to subsequent therapy with high dose methylprednisolone and rituximab. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL, Richter's transformation) was diagnosed in 6 patients at a median time of 6.0 months (range 2.4-17.4) after initiation of PAR. Five of these patients had not responded to the PAR treatment regimen and one had achieved a CRi. Three of these patients had 17p13- and TP53 mutations (TP53 dysfunction) and one had a TP53 mutation without 17p13- (one patient did not have TP53 sequencing data). The DLBCL cells had the same immunoglobulin gene rearrangement as the patients CLL cells (clonal transformation) in all four patients tested. Only two patients had their DLBCL tissue tested for Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) by IHC and both were negative. Four patients developed DLBCL prior to any subsequent treatment for their CLL at a median time of 4.4 months (range 2.4-7.2 months). Two patients developed DLBCL after receiving subsequent treatment for progressive CLL. All six patients died from DLBCL with a median time from diagnosis of DLBCL to death of 9.3 months (5.2-19.3). No additional hematological malignancies were observed. One patient was diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma 3.2 months after initiation of the treatment regimen. Of the five patients aged 70 years or older, two completed three cycles of therapy per protocol. Three patients received two cycles of therapy but did not receive the third cycle because of decisions by the patients and treating physicians based on the severity of cytopenias and social issues. Twenty-two (56%, 95% CI 40-72) patients responded to therapy with 4 (10%) CR, 7 (18%) CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), and 11 (28%) partial responses (PR). Seven (18%) patients had stable disease (SD), and 10 (26%) patients had progressive disease (PD) prior to response evaluation. Four patients (3 CR and 1 CRi) met the criteria for a stringent complete response (IHC negative bone marrow study). The median follow-up for patients still alive was 35 months (range 3-58). Twenty-four patients have had progressive disease. The median progression free survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3,18.3) (Figure 1A). Twenty-one patients have received subsequent treatment for progressive CLL. \",\n"," \"In addition, four patients received additional treatment for their CLL at their physicians' discretion before meeting standard criteria for progression and were censored for time to re-treatment. Seven patients proceeded to planned reduced intensity allogeneic transplant after completing this treatment regimen. These patients had all responded to therapy (5 PR, 1 CRi, 1 stringent CR) and were censored for time to re-treatment. The median time to re-treatment was 9.1 months (95% CI: 5.7,27.0)(Figure 1B). Seventeen patients have died from progressive disease including DLBCL (n=14), infection (n=2, pneumonia, sepsis), and complications of RIC allotransplant (n=1). Median overall survival was 34.1 months (95% CI: 13.6, not reached)(Figure 1C). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients predicted to have loss of TP53 function (17p13- and dysfunctional TP53 mutation) responded to therapy (3 CR/CRi, 4 PR). Of the 3 patients with a CR/CRi, one was censored at 6 months because of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (RIC allotransplant). The other two patients, both of whom had mutated IGHV and one of whom had purine analogue refractory CLL, have not received subsequent treatment after being followed for 27.1 and 41.2 months. Of the 4 patients with a PR, two were previously untreated with 17p13- and were censored at 4.3 and 6.6 months because they underwent RIC allotransplant. The other two patients had subsequent treatment at 8.3 months and 27 months. The latter patient had mutated IGHV. One of the two patients with 17p13- without detectable TP53 mutations had a PR and subsequently was censored at 5.4 months because of additional therapy including a RIC allotransplant. The other patient had PD and died from progressive CLL at 9.8 months. Two of the 5 patients with TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p13- responded to therapy (CRi). Of these patients one with mutated IGHV had not yet been retreated at 46.8 months and the other had unmutated IGHV and required subsequent treatment at 7.5 months. Of the 3 patients who did not respond, one had mutated IGHV. Both patients with a CLL clone with 17p13- and 11q22- had PD before completing their PAR treatment. Outcomes in patients with TP53 dysfunction (17p13- and TP53 mutation, n = 13) were compared to the other patients on this clinical trial. \",\n"," 'There were no significant differences in the overall response rate (54% vs. 58%, p=1), CR/CRi (23% vs. 31%), TTT (median 9.1 vs. 8.3 months, p=0.92) or OS (median 16.8 months vs. not reached, p=0.20) (Supplementary Figure 1A). The comparison of patients with 17p13- to those without 17p13- showed no significant differences in these parameters (data not shown). Seven (54%, 95% CI:25,81) of the 13 patients with purine analogue refractory CLL responded to therapy with 4 CR/CRi and 3 PR. This was not significantly different from the 56% response rate (95%CI: 30,80) among the 16 patients responsive to their most recent purine analogue containing treatment regimen. Of the seven (54%) purine analogue refractory patients who had no detectible TP53 defects, all had unmutated IGHV and 3 had 11q22-. Five of these patients responded to treatment (2 CRi, 3 PR). Three patients were censored because of subsequent treatment at 4.2, 6.8, and 8.5 months. The TTT in the other four patients ranged from 1.3-11.4 months and three patients have died. There was no difference between purine analogue refractory and sensitive patients for TTT (median 9.1 vs. 25.9 months, p=0.97) or OS (18.3 months vs. not reached, p=0.27)(Supplementary Figure 1B). CLL patients with TP53 dysfunction or purine analogue refractory disease in the absence of detectable TP53 dysfunction comprise a cohort with a very high risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. Patients with very high risk CLL (n=21) did not have a significantly different TTT (median 9.1 months vs. 8.3 months, p=0.90) or OS (median 18.3 months vs. not reached, p=0.18) (Supplementary Figure 1C) compared to the 18 patients who did not have very high risk CLL. Three of the 8 patients previously treated with alemtuzumab responded to treatment (all PR). Of the 5 patients 70 years or older (n=5), three responded to treatment (1 CR, 2 PR). The median TTT in this older population was 8.3 months (range 2.7-33.9), three patients died at 7.1, 10.8, and 23.4 months after initiation of PAR and two were alive at 50.8 and 58.0 months. We studied all 26 patients with a baseline ALC >5 x109/L who had not received rituximab therapy for at least one month prior to starting the PAR regimen and had the appropriate specimens collected per protocol. ',\n"," 'The results from evaluation of the effects of IV infusion of low doses (20 mg/m2) of rituximab on normalized levels of ALC (n=14) and of CD20 on circulating CLL cells (n=26) extends and generalizes our previous report in which only six patients received low dose rituximab therapy. The results of infusion of rituximab on day 1 were still evident on day 3, as manifested by decreases in ALC, based on measurements in blood samples (Day 3 Pre) taken just before the second rituximab infusion (p<0.001)(Figure 2A). Moreover, the second rituximab infusion (on day 3) led to rapid and substantial decreases in ALC; on average ALC were reduced to 30% of the respective values before initiation of therapy (p<0.001)(Figure 2A). The first 3 mg dose of alemtuzumab was injected SQ on day 3 after the rituximab infusion, but it is unlikely that this low SQ dose had an immediate effect on ALC. Moreover, although rituximab was also infused on day 5, and alemtuzumab was administered SQ on days 4 and 5 (10 mg and 30 mg, respectively), by day 8 there was a modest, but significant increase in ALC (p<0.05)(Figure 2A), very likely reflecting re-equilibration, between day 5 and day 8, of additional CLL cells into the bloodstream from other compartments. Although cells were indeed cleared from the bloodstream on day 3 (Figure 2A, Day 3 Post), we observed simultaneous loss of CD20 from surviving circulating cells (Figure 2B), and the % of CD20 lost was independent of the starting CD20 levels for a given patient CLL cell population (p=0.733 for fresh samples and p=0.467 for PBMC, Spearman Rank Order correlation). Thus, as we reported previously, based on clinical studies and in vitro models, we find that both trogocytosis (\"shaving\") of CD20 and clearance (both processes likely mediated by fixed tissue macrophages) occurs simultaneously for populations of circulating CLL cells that are opsonized with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab. In order to test for additional validation of this idea, we also examined surviving CLL cells for deposition of C3d fragments. It is well established that cells that are opsonized with rituximab should activate complement, thus allowing in vivo covalent tagging with C3b fragments which will rapidly decay to C3d. ',\n"," 'In the present low-dose rituximab paradigm, if these C3d-tagged cells are not cleared, but CD20 is partially removed, then evidence that the cells must have been previously opsonized with rituximab would be the \"residual\" covalently bound C3d. Indeed, we find that among the surviving CLL cells, significant amounts of C3d fragments are indeed demonstrable (Figure 2C). We examined CLL cells collected on day 3 after therapy (Day 3 Post) for different patients, and we also find that there is a linear correlation between the amount of deposited C3d on the cells and the residual levels of CD20 (correlation coefficient=0.833, p=0.005)(Figures 2D,E). Moreover, dot plots for CLL cells analyzed in these Day 3 Post samples from two representative patients also reveal an approximately linear correlation between the amount of deposited C3d and residual levels of CD20 (Figure 2F). This is reasonable because within a given CLL cell population, the cells with the most CD20 before rituximab infusion will have the most CD20 after, because the % of CD20 loss is not dependent on starting CD20 levels, and higher starting levels of CD20 should of course presage more complement activation and more C3d deposition. Thus, even though CD20 is reduced, the \"signature\" on cells that had been opsonized with rituximab will be residual CD20 along with deposited C3d. Finally, it is important to note that by day 8, expression of CD20 on circulating cells had increased compared to the day 3 post (Figure 2B), indicating that the lower rituximab doses had less profound long-term effects on CD20 levels than has been found for the standard 375 mg/m2 dose of rituximab (>90% loss of CD20 expression). In addition, because the CD20 target is \"restored\" on circulating cells, the next rituximab dose would, as previously reported, be expected to continue to target and clear the CD20 positive cells. We also probed the CLL cells from the Day 3 post treatment samples with the monoclonal anti-human Fc antibody HB43 in order to determine if any rituximab was still bound to the cells soon after completion of the second rituximab infusion. Of 23 patient samples that could be evaluated, 15 had no measureable bound rituximab, but 8 had modest level of rituximab bound, corresponding to 16+-7 % (p<0.001) of the maximum binding that was possible, based on reacting naive CLL cells (sample 1) with excess rituximab (or ofatumumab) followed by monoclonal antibody HB43. ',\n"," 'Several lines of evidence suggest that complement control proteins (CCP) on cancer cells are likely to promote resistance of these cells to monoclonal antibody-based therapies that depend upon complement activation to promote cell elimination. Indeed, under certain conditions CCP might be up-regulated in response to complement-dependent therapies; that is, cells under attack by rituximab and alemtuzumab that express the highest levels of CCP are more likely to survive and this could lead to evolution of more CDC- resistant phenotypes. Therefore, we examined levels of the three key CCP on CLL cells: CD46, CD55 and CD59, before, and after the rituximab and alemtuzumab infusions. Our results (Supplementary Figures 2A-C) indicate that soon after infusion of rituximab there appear to be small but significant decreases in expression of these proteins on surviving CLL cells. These results may be most readily explained based on \"innocent bystander\" decreases in the levels of one or more of these proteins, which can accompany trogocytosis of CD20 mediated by rituximab However, by day 8, after the three infusions of rituximab and alemtuzumab, expression of the three CCP had increased modestly and had returned to close to baseline levels, following the general pattern seen for CD20. We have previously shown in vitro that rituximab-coated target cells can induce changes in NK cell phenotype consistent with NK cell activation including a rapid down-modulation of CD16 and up regulation of a number of markers including CD54. In vivo studies confirmed these changes take place within four hours of therapy with standard dose rituximab, and also are associated with trafficking of NK cells out of the circulation. In this study 8 patients had suitable blood samples taken before and 48 hours after the initiation of RTX therapy with an NK count of at least 0.5% of mononuclear cells in the pre-therapy sample. For logistical reasons, the post rituximab sample was obtained 48 hours after the initiation of the rituximab infusion. As illustrated in Figure 3, low dose rituximab therapy resulted in a significant decrease in NK cell CD16 expression (p=0.001) (Figure 3A), up regulation of surface CD54 (p=0.04) (Figure 3B), and a reduction in NK cell numbers (p<0.0001)(Figure 3C), which indicates NK cell activation by treatment with low dose rituximab. We report the results of treatment of patients with high risk and relapsed/refractory CLL using a novel chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining a purine analogue with alemtuzumab and low dose rituximab. ',\n"," 'This regimen was relatively well tolerated with 67% patients receiving the planned duration of therapy. Only 5 (12.8%) patients did not complete therapy because of treatment related adverse events and there were no treatment related deaths. The overall response rate was 56% of patients with half of the responders achieving a CR/CRi. Despite the short median progression free survival, the median overall survival was 34 months. In addition, patients with very-high risk CLL as defined by TP53 dysfunction or purine analogue refractory disease (n=21) had similar responses to treatment compared to those patients without these adverse characteristics. The correlative laboratory studies showed that the low dose rituximab regimen activated both complement and NK cells and resulted in more limited loss as well as more rapid recovery of CD20 expression by CLL cells compared to that previous demonstrated for treatment with standard dose rituximab. In this small study the CR/CRi rate of 28% was lower than the 30% considered the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the regimen. However, the response to treatment compared favorably with the results of recently reported previous studies in similar patients using other alemtuzumab based combination therapies. The toxicity of the PAR regimen appears to have been less severe than that previously reported for CLL treatment regimens including fludarabine and alemtuzumab used either concomitantly or sequentially. Factors contributing to the lower toxicity of the PAR regimen could have included required prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and CMV monitoring with treatment of CMV reactivation, and the limited duration (maximum of 3 months) of alemtuzumab therapy. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was subsequently diagnosed in 6 (15%) patients treated with PAR and was an important cause of treatment failure and mortality. The study population had a high frequency of advanced stage disease (59%), TP53 dysfunction (33%), 11q22- (15%), unmutated IGHV (69%), and ZAP70 expression (72%), all of which are associated with an increased risk of DLBCL in patients with CLL. Although treatment of CLL with alemtuzumab and purine analogues has also been reported to be associated with development of DLBCL, the role of these drugs in the development of DLBCL remains unclear. In this study, the median interval between starting PAR therapy and the diagnosis of DLBCL was only 4.4 months from start of PAR in patients who did not receive subsequent therapy for their CLL. ',\n"," \"This short interval suggests that DLBCL developed prior to the start of PAR therapy and the treatment of the CLL could have accelerated the diagnosis of the DLBCL rather than being a causative factor in these patients. Of note, a similar high rate of DLBCL was recently reported in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. The high rate of DLBCL in our study population is clearly a serious problem, but we cannot determine whether or not PAR therapy contributed to this complication. There is now substantial evidence that use of conventional doses of rituximab (375 - 500 mg/m2) for the treatment of CLL results in a considerable decrease in CD20 expression by the circulating CLL cells, which results in a loss of efficacy of this drug. In this study, we tested the effect of higher frequency, low dose IV rituximab on expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells and on the activation of NK cells. Our correlative measurements confirm that at rituximab doses as low as 20mg/m2, cells undergo three separate and interrelated fates. These doses provide sufficient rituximab to opsonize and clear the majority of circulating cells, because at the end of the infusion on day 3, ALC levels are reduced considerably (Figure 2A). However, the surviving cells do suffer some loss of CD20 and are also covalently tagged with C3d, indicating that they were also opsonized with rituximab, but were not cleared (Figures 2B,C). Indeed, as demonstrated previously, both clearance and loss of expression of CD20 appear to occur simultaneously, and both processes are mediated in part by the same effector cells, fixed tissue macrophages which express Fcgamma receptors. We also can confirm that loss of CD20 is less pronounced under these low-dose rituximab conditions, and that considerable restoration of CD20 on circulating cells is readily seen based on analyses of blood samples on day 8 (Figure 2B). Moreover, we found that complement was activated based on the appearance of C3d-tagged cells, and the present studies, although limited in time, suggest that CCP are not up-regulated in response to rituximab or alemtuzumab therapy (Supplementary Figure 2). We also found that cells with the most residual CD20 had the greatest amount of deposited C3d. \",\n"," \"This analysis cannot be performed after infusion of large quantities (> 300 mg) of rituximab or ofatumumab, because under these conditions loss of CD20 reaches values in excess of 90%. Our correlative studies also demonstrated that a single, low dose (20 mg/m2 IV) of rituximab therapy can induce activation of NK cells within two days of therapy as indicated by down-modulation of CD16, upregulation of CD54 and a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells (Figure 3). These findings are similar to those found in our prior studies exploring the effect of full dose rituximab on NK cell activation despite a number of differences between the current and prior studies including dose of rituximab (20mg/m2 vs. 375mg/m2), patients (CLL versus lymphoma without significant numbers of circulating B cells) and timing of the post-rituximab sampling (48 hours versus 4 hours). Together, this data suggests the short-term effect of low dose rituximab on NK cell activation is similar to that seen with standard dose therapy. The strengths of our study are detailed characterization of the biology of the patients' malignant B cells, and the comprehensive follow up of all patients after completion of therapy. The study design allowed for collection of serial blood samples that could address important questions about the optimal dosing of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. The limitations of this study include the relatively small number of patients and the limited data on TTT because of early initiation of subsequent treatment, especially in patients proceeding to planned RIC allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This limitation is especially important with regard to determining the benefit of PAR therapy in CLL patients with very high risk disease, where the lack of differences in outcome could reflect the small sample size rather than a true equivalence of treatment efficacy. In conclusion, PAR is effective and tolerable therapy that could be of value in management of patients with very-high risk CLL who fail targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and in patients requiring disease control before therapy with allogeneic transplant or chimeric antigen receptor therapy. This study showed that low dose rituximab activates components of the innate immune system known to be important in its anti-CLL effect without substantially decreasing CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells after treatment. \",\n"," 'Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with TP53 aberrations respond poorly to first-line chemoimmunotherapy resulting in early relapse and short survival. We investigated the safety and activity of ibrutinib in previously untreated and relapsed or refractory CLL with TP53 aberrations. In this investigator-initiated, single-arm phase 2 study we enrolled eligible adult patients with active CLL with TP53 aberrations at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD, USA). Patients received 28-day cycles of ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of limiting toxicities. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment at 24 weeks in all evaluable patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01500733, and is fully enrolled. Between Dec 22, 2011 and Jan 2, 2014 we enrolled 51 patients; 47 had CLL with deletion 17p13.1 and four carried a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. All patients had active disease requiring therapy. 35 enrolled patients had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR 12 9-27 0). 33 previously untreated patients and 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluable for response at 24 weeks. 32 (97%; 95% CI 86-100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response, including partial response in 18 patients (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One patient had progressive disease at 0 4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) achieved a partial response and six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis; the remaining three (20%) patients had stable disease. Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient), anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient). Grade 3 pneumonia occurred in three (6%) patients, and grade 3 rash in one (2%) patient. The activity and safety profile of single-agent ibrutinib in CLL with TP53 aberrations is encouraging and supports its consideration as a novel treatment option for patients with this high-risk disease in both first-line and second-line settings Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, Danish Cancer Society, Novo Nordisk Foundation, National Institutes of Health Medical Research Scholars Program, and Pharmacyclics Inc. ',\n"," 'Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard of care for patients who need treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Patients with TP53 aberrations respond less well to treatment than do those without this high-risk genetic lesion resulting in early relapse and inferior survival. Deletion of chromosome band 17p13.1 results in loss of one allele of the tumour suppressor gene TP53, and the other allele is often incapacitated through point mutations. The P53 pathway induces cell death in response to DNA damage, and its inactivation is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. In previously untreated patients the prevalence of deletion 17p13.1 and TP53 mutations, which often occur together, ranges from 7% to 11 5%. However, selection of chemotherapyresistant clones during treatment increases the prevalence of TP53 aberrations at relapse. The identification of appropriate treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations is a research priority. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has long been viewed as the only option for long-term disease control in these patients. Consensus guidelines recommend allogeneic stem-cell transplantation during first remission for patients with CLL and TP53 aberrations. However, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is not broadly applicable due to the advanced age of most patients with CLL, and transplant-related mortality remains a concern. Alternative treatment options are scarce. The anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab is active in CLL with TP53 aberrations but most responses are not durable and the agent is associated with a high incidence of grade 3 or worse infections. Promising new options include kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib or idelalisib, which have shown activity in relapsed or refractory patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including deletion 17p13.1. With the advent of these novel therapies the role of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations is being re-assessed. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is an orally bioavailable, covalent inhibitor of Bruton\\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK).\"] Once-daily administration causes sustained inactivation of the kinase resulting in inhibition of B-cell receptor signalling and tumour-microenvironment interactions. In a 2013 report of a phase 1b-2 study, 71% of patients in the ibrutinib 420 mg dosing group with relapsed or refractory CLL achieved a response according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria. An additional 20% of patients had partial responses with lymphocytosis. More recently, a randomised comparison of ibrutinib versus the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab showed superior activity of ibrutinib over ofatumumab, including improved survival. ',\n"," 'of ibrutinib over ofatumumab, including improved survival. Based on these studies and the encouraging activity of ibrutinib in patients with deletion 17p13.1, ibrutinib received full Food and Drug Administration approval in the USA on July 28, 2014 for patients with CLL who have received at least one previous therapy, and for those with CLL with deletion 17p13.1. Approval by the European Commission for patients who have received at least one previous therapy, or in first-line CLL patients in the presence of deletion 17p13.1 or TP53 mutation in those unsuitable for chemotherapy was granted on Oct 17, 2014. In view of the encouraging activity of ibrutinib in CLL and the few treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of ibrutinib in this high-risk patient population. For this phase 2, open-label, single-center, investigator-initiated study, between Dec 22, 2011, and Jan 2, 2014, we enrolled previously untreated patients with CLL and patients with relapsed or refractory disease at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, USA. Eligibility criteria included: diagnosis of CLL, including small lymphocytic lymphoma according to WHO criteria, with deletion 17p13.1 identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) in at least 10% of nuclei scored or presence of TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1; active disease requiring therapy according to the IWCLL criteria; age 18 years or older; ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; neutrophil count of at least 500 cells per muL. Exclusion criteria included: being younger than 18 years; transformed disease; autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia necessitating steroid therapy; impaired hepatic function (total bilirubin level >=1 5xthe upper limit of normal [ULN] unless due to Gilbert\\'s disease, or aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >=2 5xULN unless caused by infiltration of the liver), impaired renal function (creatinine concentration >=2 0 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate <=50 mL/min), active Hepatitis B infection, HIV infection, concomitant corticosteroid treatment at doses equivalent to prednisone more than 20 mg per day, and anticoagulation with warfarin.\"] For previously treated patients, a 4-week washout period was required. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute institutional review board. All patients provided written informed consent. ',\n"," 'Pretreatment assessments included a complete medical history; physical examination; ECOG performance evaluation; complete blood count; liver and renal function tests; beta2-microglobulin; serum free light chains; viral serologies for HIV and hepatitis B; lymphocyte phenotyping; bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Flow cytometry was used to show that all patients had circulating tumour cells consistent with CLL. Pretreatment lymph node biopsies were obtained in all patients with superficial lymphadenopathy. Interphase FISH was done on peripheral blood or bone marrow in the National Cancer Institute Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory with the Vysis probe (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA); results from accredited external testing facilities were accepted. Sequencing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) was done by LBP in the laboratory of CG (Copenhagen, Denmark). Patients received ibrutinib 420 mg administered orally once daily on a continuous schedule until disease progression or toxicity necessitated drug discontinuation. Each cycle was 28 days (give or take 4 days). Ibrutinib treatment was paused in cases of grade 4 neutropenia lasting for longer than 7 days or any grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Patients who had a first occurrence of grade 3 diarrhoea, constitutional symptoms, or infection were restarted at the same dose when the toxicity resolved to grade 1 severity or less or to baseline. For any other grade 3 adverse event, the dose was reduced by 140 mg. For new-onset or symptomatic atrial fibrillation (grade 2), ibrutinib treatment was paused and a cardiac assessment was done. After resolution of a first occurrence of atrial fibrillation of up to grade 2 severity, the study drug could be restarted at the same dose. Safety monitoring was done every other week for the first month, then monthly until month 6, and every 3 months thereafter. Laboratory tests as part of safety monitoring included complete blood counts, and acute care, hepatic, and mineral panels. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment after six cycles of therapy at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were safety, overall survival, progression-free survival, best response, and nodal response. Data cutoff for study analysis was Aug 1, 2014. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Haematological adverse events were graded according to IWCLL criteria. ',\n"," 'Responses were assessed based on IWCLL 2008 criteria, incorporating the recent updates on partial response with lymphocytosis (appendix p 2). Clinical response was assessed at each visit. At 2, 6, and 12 months, radiological assessments were done. Responses reported here are based on these radiological assessments. Bone marrow evaluation was undertaken in 42 patients at 8 weeks, and in 47 patients at 24 weeks. The bone marrow at 8 weeks was omitted in the first patients and one patient refused bone marrow biopsy at 24 weeks. Bone marrow samples were assessed by immunostaining. FISH for deletion 17p13.1 was repeated on blood samples at 24 weeks. The frequency of deletion 17p13.1 in all CLL cells was calculated as 1 divided by the proportion of CD19+ cells in all lymphocytes multiplied by the proportion of cells with deletion 17p13.1. Spleen volume was calculated from CT scans with the Vitrea Core Workstation Server, version 6.6 (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN, USA). We used a Simon\\'s minimax two-stage design to test the null hypothesis that the proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the study was 15% or lower versus the alternative hypothesis that it was 40% or higher, with a type I error of 0 05 and 90% power.\"] We established that a sample size of 27 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint was needed. Initially, both untreated and relapsed or refractory patients were enrolled. On Aug 24, 2012, the study was amended by the investigators to allow enrolment of an entire cohort of 27 previously untreated patients, in addition to a cohort of 16 patients with relapsed or refractory disease. We enrolled eight additional previously untreated patients to account for the possibility of non-treatment-related discontinuation before 6 months. The safety and survival analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. Objective responses were assessed in patients who were evaluable at 24 weeks. We used descriptive statistics to summarise the findings in each of the defined cohorts, including the primary endpoint. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival (defined as time from study enrolment to death) and progression-free survival (defined as time from study enrolment to progression or death). We estimated the cumulative incidence of progression by considering deaths without relapse as competing risk events. We compared survival probabilities by the log-rank test and cumulative incidence by the Gray\\'s test.\"] R version 3.1.1 was used for statistical analyses. ',\n"," \"This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01500733. his study was funded by the Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.

The investigators analysed the data and wrote the report. A draft was submitted to Pharmacyclics for comments. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the content of the report and the decision to submit for publication. Between Dec 22, 2011 and Jan 2, 2014, we screened 85 patient records and enrolled 51 eligible patients with CLL, of whom 35 had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease (figure 1, table 1). Most patients had advanced Rai stage and IGHV-unmutated disease (table 1). 47 patients had deletion 17p13.1 identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation in at least 10% of nuclei scored and four patients (two in each cohort) had a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. 35 patients were previously untreated, 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. At the time of analysis, median follow-up for all patients was 24 months (IQR 12 9-27 0). Median follow-up for the previously untreated cohort was 15 months (IQR 12 5-25 7) and for the relapsed or refractory cohort was 26 months (25 4--28 3). 42 (82%) of 51 enrolled patients are still on treatment without disease progression. Nine (18%) of 51 patients discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression in five (10%) patients, and three (6%) deaths. One patient, who was found to have Hodgkin's lymphoma that predated enrolment into the study, was taken off study and is included in the safety analysis only (figure 1, appendix p 1). Progressive disease was caused by Richter's transformation in three patients. An additional two patients had prolymphocytic transformation. Median time to progression for these five patients was 7 5 months (IQR 7 2 - 15 0). \",\n"," 'At 24 weeks 48 patients were evaluable for response (33 previously untreated patients and 15 relapsed/refractory patients). 44 (92%; 95% CI 84 - 100) of these 48 patients achieved an objective response; 24 (50%) had a partial response, and 20 (42%) patients achieved an objective response(95% CI 84-99.5), 24 (50%)a partial response with lymphocytosis (table 2). 32 (97%; 95% CI 86 - 100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response including partial response in 18 (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One previously untreated patient had progressive disease at 0 4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) patients achieved a partial response, six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis, and three patients had stable disease. The proportion of patients achieving an overall response in subgroups based on IGHV mutation status, age, Rai disease stage, beta2-microglobulin, or the presence of bulky lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly was similar (appendix p 3). However, the distribution of partial response and partial response with lymphocyotsis showed some variation (appendix p 3), consistent with different rates of resolution of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis between patients. The rate and depth of response increased with time. Partial response was recorded in six (13%) of 48 patients at 8 weeks and in 24 (50%) at 24 weeks. Conversely, a partial response with lymphocytosis was recorded in 24 (50%) patients at 8 weeks and 20 (42%) patients at 24 weeks. The best response achieved was objective response in 45 (94%; 95% CI 87-100) of all 48 evaluable patients, in 32 (97%; 86-100) of the 33 evaluable patients with previously untreated disease, and in 13 (87%; 69 5-100) of the 15 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Five (10%) of all evaluable patients had a complete response as best response, of whom four had IGHV-unmutated CLL, and all except for one were previously untreated. Median time to complete response was 48 weeks (IQR 48-48). Rapid disease control was achieved in all tissue compartments, reaching at least a 50% mean reduction in tumour burden in both spleen and lymph nodes at 8 weeks, with further improvements on continued therapy (figure 2A, 2B).Responses in the bone marrow seemed to be somewhat slower than in the spleen and lymph nodes. ',\n"," 'At 8 weeks, at least a 50% decrease in tumour burden in the bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen was recorded in 16 (44%) of 36, 31 (70%) of 44, and 30 (79%) of 38 patients with complete data, respectively. At the completion of 24 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in tumour burden in bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen was 34 (83%) of 41, 42 (93%) of 45, and 38 (95%) of 40 patients with complete data, respectively. Reasons for incomplete data include omission of bone marrow biopsies or insufficient material (n=2 at 8 weeks, n=7 at 24 weeks), missing scans (n=2 at 8 weeks, n=1 at 24 weeks), and absence of pathological lymphadenopathy (n=2) or splenomegaly (n=7) at baseline. In three patients, no residual CLL infiltrate was detected in the bone marrow by immunohistochemistry. The quality of tumour response in the tissue sites did not differ by previous treatment history or IGHV mutation status (figure 2C, 2D). The characteristic treatment-induced lymphocytosis was reported in most patients, and the degree and kinetics did not differ in previously untreated patients compared with those with relapsed or refractory disease (figure 2C). By contrast, patients with IGHV-mutated CLL had a greater relative increase and slower resolution of lymphocytosis than did those with IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 2D). Estimated progression-free survival for all patients on an intention-to-treat basis at 24 months was 82% (95% CI 71-94), and overall survival at 24 months was 80% (68-94) (figure 3A, 3B). At final follow-up for this report (Aug 1, 2014), eight (16%) patients had died: five (10%) from progressive disease, two (4%) from infection, and one (2%) patient with sudden unexplained death that was judged to be possibly treatment related (appendix p 1). The estimated overall survival at 24 months was 84% (95% CI 72-100) for previously untreated patients and 74% (57-100) for patients with relapsed or refractory disease (figure 3C); it was 94% (95% CI 84-100) in IGHV-mutated and 71% (53-94) in IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 3D). The cumulative incidence of progression at 24 months was 20% (95% CI 5-44) in patients with relapsed or refractory disease, 9% (1-27) in previously untreated patients (figure 3E), and 20% (7-39) for IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 3F). None of the patients with IGHV-mutated CLL have progressed so far. ',\n"," 'To assess whether or not deletion 17p13.1 confers resistance to ibrutinib, we established the proportion of CLL cells carrying deletion 17p13.1 at baseline and after 24 weeks on treatment. In 43 evaluable patients, the proportion of CLL cells with deletion 17p13.1 decreased in 20 (47%) patients (median decrease 48% [IQR 18 7-82 8%]), increased in 20 (47%) patients (median increase 12% [4 2-43 9%]), and remained unchanged in three (6%) patients (appendix p 4). In the 20 patients with a relative increase in the frequency of deletion 17p13.1, none progressed, 18 (90%) had a clinical response at 24 weeks, and two (10%) patients had stable disease. All of these patients are still continuing in the study on treatment without progression at data cutoff (Aug 1, 2014). Of the four patients who developed progressive disease beyond 24 weeks, two were included in this analysis, in both of whom the proportion of CLL cells with deletion 17p13.1 was decreased compared with baseline at 24 weeks. Treatment with ibrutinib was well tolerated. Most nonhaematological adverse events were of grade 1 or 2 severity (table 3). The most frequent possibly treatmentrelated adverse events were arthralgia, diarrhoea, rash, nail ridging, bruising, and muscle spasms or cramps. The most common non-haematological grade 3 adverse event was pneumonia in three (6%) patients. No grade 3 or worse bleeding events occurred. One patient (2%) required a dose reduction for grade 3 rash. No other adverse events required dose reductions or withdrawal of patients from the study. Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients, anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (table 3). Cytopenias mainly occurred during the first few months on therapy, improved with continuous treatment, and were not associated with infections or bleeding. TP53 aberrations identify a high-risk group of patients with CLL for whom no standard treatment exists. Responses to front-line chemoimmunotherapy are short lived. Ibrutinib has shown activity in relapsed and refractory patients including in those with deletion 17p13.1. We report mature results from a phase 2 trial of single-agent ibrutinib for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations including:to the best of our knowledge:the largest experience in previously untreated patients receiving this targeted agent as first-line therapy (panel). Ibrutinib induced responses in 32 (97%) of the 33 evaluable, previously untreated patients; the estimated rate of progression was 9% (95% CI 1a$\"27) at 24 months. ',\n"," \"This finding contrasts with responses in around 68% of patients and median progression-free survival of less than 12 months when first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab are used to treat these high-risk patients. Our study includes 35 patients with TP53 aberrations receiving ibrutinib as first-line therapy:a number that is similar to the combined 30 previously untreated patients with deletion 17p13.1 who were treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in the two largest studies done so far. Another non-chemotherapy based regimen active in CLL with TP53 aberrations is alemtuzumab with methylprednisolone, which in first line achieved a response in 88% of patients and a median progression-free survival of 18 3 months (95% CI 15 6-not available). Longer follow-up with ibrutinib is needed to better assess durability of response and the possible need for subsequent treatment. Safety and tolerability of treatment with ibrutinib was favourable and similar to findings reported in other studies. Only one patient needed a dose reduction and no patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. In the phase 1b-2 study of single-agent ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory CLL, the estimated progression-free survival at 26 months for patients with deletion 17p13.1 was 57%, but more than 90% for patients without deletion 17p13.1 or 11q22.3. We therefore sought to investigate whether deletion 17p13.1 confers resistance to ibrutinib that would lead to relapse as reported with chemoimmunotherapy. However, sequential FISH analysis provided no evidence for the selection of resistant subclones with deletion 17p13.1 during ibrutinib therapy, which supports a probably P53-independent mechanism of action. The type of response that occurred with ibrutinib differs from that achieved with chemoimmunotherapy. Deep remissions, at least during the first year on therapy, were rare, even in previously untreated patients. However, as we and others have previously reported, residual disease that persists during ibrutinib therapy consists mostly of quiescent cells with a low proliferative rate. Consistently, the presence of residual disease does not seem to predict treatment failure, by contrast with the experience with chemoimmunotherapy. Disease progression on treatment was reported in only five (10%) patients and occurred at a median of 7 5 months (IQR 7 2-15 0). Notably, all five patients had transformation, which manifested as Richter's syndrome in three patients and as prolymphocytic transformation in two. In retrospect, transformation might have already been present at study entry in two patients (appendix p 1). \",\n"," 'In addition to TP53 aberrations, all the patients who progressed had additional high-risk disease features at baseline: all had IGHV-unmutated CLL, two had MYC amplification (a rare ultra-high-risk event in CLL), and three had been heavily pretreated. Recently, Richter\\'s transformation was reported in 23% of patients with deletion 17p13.1 after a median of 12 months from first-line therapy, mainly with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Thus, the rate of transformation on ibrutinib seems to be lower than reported with other frequently used first-line therapies for high-risk patients. However, additional follow-up will be needed to better assess the long-term transformation rate in patients treated with ibrutinib. Tumour microenvironment interactions and B-cell receptor signalling are pivotal pathogenic pathways in CLL and are targets for new therapeutic approaches. The substantial reduction in disease burden and the notable reduction in intracellular signalling, cellular activation, and proliferation throughout the different anatomical compartments is consistent with the role of BTK as a central node in many signalling pathways. Recently, acquired mutations in BTK and PLCg2 that confer resistance to ibrutinib have been reported. However, the low frequency of these mutations suggests that tumour cells cannot easily bypass the block in intracellular signalling imposed by ibrutinib. In conclusion, single-agent ibrutinib induced durable responses in CLL with TP53 aberrations. Treatment failure in previously untreated patients was rare. Subclones with deletion 17p13.1 were equally sensitive to ibrutinib as were those not carrying the deletion, which is consistent with a P53-independent mechanism of action of the drug. The quality and duration of response might be improved further with combination therapy. These data support the use of ibrutinib as first-line therapy of CLL with TP53 aberrations. Longer follow-up will be needed to assess the effect of this targeted agent on long-term survival, which will clarify whether or not ibrutinib could eventually replace allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for these high-risk patients. We designed this study in 2011 to investigate novel treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations. Although chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab was firmly established as an effective regimen for most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), patients with TP53 aberrations had poor outcomes. We searched PubMed for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2006, and June, 2011 for treatment options in CLL with TP53 aberrations or deletion 17p13.1, using the search terms \"chronic lymphocytic leukemia\", \"TP53\", \"deletion 17p\", \"alemtuzumab\", \"flavopiridol\", and \"lenalidomide\". ',\n"," 'In particular, alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, and flavopiridol, were shown to have activity in at least a subset of these high-risk patients (summarised by Badoux and colleagues). However, responses to these agents were often short lived. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was known to provide long-term disease control and consensus guidelines recommend this transplantation approach in first remission for patients with CLL and deletion 17p13.1. Early data about ibrutinib presented at scientific meetings suggested it had good activity in CLL, irrespective of whether or not classical high-risk disease features were present. Several studies have now established ibrutinib as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for relapsed or refractory patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations. Ibrutinib is now approved in both the USA and Europe for patients with relapsed disease and as first-line therapy for CLL with deletion 17p13.1 (USA and EU) or TP53 aberrations (EU). Our study provides mature data for the largest cohort so far of such high-risk patients receiving ibrutinib as first-line therapy. Although progressive disease manifested as transformation in 10% of patients on this study, the rate of transformation on ibrutinib seems to be lower than previously reported with first-line chemoimmunotherapy. With the advent of active targeted agents such as ibrutinib, chemoimmunotherapy for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations should be avoided. ',\n"," 'CD52 and CD20 antigens are important therapeutic targets for the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) alemtuzumab and rituximab respectively. Circulating CD52 (cCD52) and CD20 (cCD20) have prognostic utility in lymphoid malignancies. The efficacy of mAb therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) may be adversely affected by cCD52 or cCD20. In this report, blood and bone marrow (BM) cCD52 and cCD20 were measured at response assessment in previously treated (N = 235) patients with CLL who received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). Univariate and multivariate statistical models evaluated correlations of pre- and response variables with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Response variables included 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) response, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) in BM, and cCD52 and cCD20 levels (blood and BM) at response assessment. Using multivariate analysis, response blood and BM cCD52, blood cCD20, and NCI-WG response were significant independent predictors of PFS. At the time of response assessment, BM cCD52 correlated with OS in univariate analysis. cCD52 and cCD20, therefore appear useful in predicting survival and may be important for monitoring patients following salvage FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) therapy. These data further indicate that plasma may be a good target to evaluate for minimal residual disease using cCD52/cCD20 levels. The clinical course for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is varied, with some patients having smouldering, asymptomatic disease and others having rapid progression. Identifying prognostic markers and factors that may be useful in guiding management and follow-up are important for patients with CLL. Prognostic factors that are being studied as potentially important predictors of clinical endpoints, such as time to treatment, response to treatment, remission duration, and overall survival (OS), include IGHV mutation status; expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 by leukaemia cells; plasma levels of beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) and circulating CD23; and presence of chromosome abnormalities, such as 17p deletion and 11q deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. These factors were initially studied in selected patient populations in retrospective analyses. True appreciation of the utility and importance of each factor will come with prospective analyses in unselected patients. Some of these factors are static and do not change through the clinical course, and others may change, such as acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (clonal evolution). Less is known about the importance of these prognostic factors in previously treated patients. ',\n"," 'Chemoimmunotherapy, specifically the combination of anti-CD20 (rituximab) and/or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapeutic agents, has shown impressive efficacy in the treatment of CLL in frontline and salvage settings. CD20 is an integral membrane protein expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes and may play a role in proliferation, differentiation, and regulation of B lymphocyte activities. Although it has four transmembrane-spanning regions, and therefore is highly membrane embedded, high levels of circulating CD20 (cCD20) have been detected in plasma samples from patients with CLL, and have been correlated with advanced stage CLL and shorter survival. This cCD20 probably represents membrane fragments in plasma from apoptotic cells that result from cell turnover, rather than specifically shed protein. In vitro studies have shown that cCD20 can interfere with rituximab binding to CLL cells; therefore, high cCD20 levels may act as an in vivo sump, altering rituximab pharmacokinetics and minimizing the clinical response to rituximab. The amount of circulating CD52 (cCD52) has prognostic value in patients with CLL. CD52 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell protein expressed on the surface of haematopoietic cells, including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. CD52 is also expressed on neoplastic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin. cCD52 was detected at higher levels in patients with CLL, compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, low levels of cCD52 were correlated with less aggressive disease, higher complete response (CR) rates following treatment and longer survival in patients with CLL. In contrast to CD20, and in view of its GPI linkage, CD52 is thought to be actively shed from the surface of lymphocytes. cCD52 may also be detected as membrane fragments produced by apoptosis and cell turnover. cCD52 may interfere with alemtuzumab binding to CLL cells, and lower levels of cCD52 have been correlated with increased response to alemtuzumab. There is a clear correlation between the response to treatment by 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria and the progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for patients with CLL. One of the potential shortcomings of the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria is that residual disease is identified by microscopic examination of blood and bone marrow, which does not address residual disease in others sites, such as lymph node and spleen. New assays to evaluate response and predict for PFS and OS potentially could therefore be used in conjunction with 1996 NCI-WG response criteria to better predict these important clinical outcomes. ',\n"," \"with 1996 NCI-WG response criteria to better predict these important clinical outcomes. We evaluated the prognostic value of cCD20 and cCD52 in peripheral blood and BM at the time of response assessment from 235 previously treated patients who received the three-drug combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Additionally, we evaluated the pre-treatment characteristics, which may be helpful in predicting PFS and OS following FCR therapy in patients with CLL. Patients in this analysis included 177 patients from a previously published study investigating the efficacy of FCR in the salvage setting for whom we had cryopreserved samples, and 58 additional patients. All patients provided informed consent according to U.T. MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional guidelines. Briefly, 235 previously treated patients with CLL were enrolled on a phase II clinical trial starting in November, 1999. Pre-treatment evaluation included history, physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, platelet (PLT) count, liver and kidney function tests, beta2M, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and BM aspiration with immunophenotyping and BM biopsy. Refractoriness to fludarabine or alkylating agents was defined as failure to achieve at least partial remission (PR) with the last agent-based treatment or progression within 6 months of treatment. Patients were to receive up to six courses of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, each daily for 3 d, and a single dose of rituximab 375 mg/m2, course 1 and 500 mg/m2 courses 2-6. Each course was 4 weeks as permitted by recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts. Response to treatment and progression were evaluated by the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria. CR required resolution of all palpable disease, normalization of blood counts and no evidence of disease in BM biopsy. Nodular partial remission (nPR) required the same criteria as for CR except that one or more lymphoid nodules or aggregates were present on bone marrow biopsy. PR criteria included at least 50% reduction in measurable disease and one or more of the following features: neutrophil count > 1 5 x 109/l or a 50% improvement over baseline, platelets >= 100 x 109/l or a 50% improvement over baseline, and haemoglobin >= 110 g/l or a 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions. Imaging studies (i.e. computed tomography scans) were not required to evaluate response. The response must have persisted for more than 2 months. Patients' BM was also evaluated by 2-colour flow cytometry for presence of CD5/19+ cells as a measure of residual disease. \",\n"," 'Blood and/or bone marrow (BM) samples for cCD20 and cCD52 evaluation were obtained pre-treatment in a limited number of patients, and at specific time points following treatment in greater proportion. Samples at the following time points from start of treatment were available for BM cCD20 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 50), 3 months (n = 29), 6 months (time of response assessment) (n = 66), 12 months (n = 71), 18 months (n = 49), 24 months (n = 48), and 36 months (n = 38); BM cCD52 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 50), 3 months (n = 29), 6 months (n = 67), 12 months (n = 71), 18 months (n = 49), 24 months (n = 48), and 36 months (n = 38); blood cCD20 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 27), 3 months (n = 22), 6 months (n = 61), 12 months (n = 68), 18 months (n = 46), 24 months (n = 54), and 36 months (n = 41); and blood cCD52 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 27), 3 months (n = 21), 6 months (n = 62), 12 months (n = 68), 18 months (n = 47), 24 months (n = 53), and 36 months (n = 42). To reduce the possibility that the clotting process may damage circulating cells and influence the levels of cCD20, plasma, rather than serum, was used for measuring cCD20 and cCD52 in blood. Anti-coagulated BM samples were centrifuged to obtain the non-cellular fluid phase used to measure BM cCD52 and cCD20. Despite the precautions taken during BM sample collection, dilution of BM samples by blood cannot be fully excluded. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to detect plasma cCD20 and cCD52 levels as previously described. Briefly, the sample was added to a 96-well polystyrene plate coated with anti-CD20 or anti-CD52, and incubated for 3 h with constant shaking at room temperature. Subsequently, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated for 3 h with 20 mul of humanized anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:400 in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0 1% Tween 20. Following six more washes with PBS-T, 100 mul of colorimetric substrate was added to the wells and plates were then incubated with constant shaking for 15-30 min. ',\n"," \"Following the addition of 50 mul of 2 N HCl to quench the reaction, the plates were read at a wavelength of 450 nm. Assessment of IGHV for MRD was performed as previously described. PCR was performed on DNA samples from blood and BM cells using 5' fluorescently end-labelled consensus primers for the rearranged IGH CDRIII region, FR3A [5'-ACACGGC(C/T)(G/C) TGTATTACTGT-3'] and VLJH (5'-GTGACCAGGGTNCCTTGGCCCCAG-3'). PCR products were resolved on 3100 genetic analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and peak areas and heights were determined by Genescan analysis software (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescently-tagged PCR amplification products were subsequently digested with the restriction enzyme HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA, USA). Resulting fragments were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel, and then isolated using gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). Ligase chain reaction (LCR) using Taq DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) was subsequently performed on patient's PCR amplified DNA, and products were resolved on the ABI 3100 under similar conditions described for the PCR assay. The ratio of the peak areas of VLJH to K-RAS (internal control) was reported as positive (ratio > 0 2), low positive (ratio < 0 2), or negative (ratio = 0). This ligase-based assay was reported to have similar sensitivity to allele-specific PCR. Patient characteristics were summarized using median (range) for numerical variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. OS time was defined as the time interval from enrollment on protocol (or start of therapy) to death or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time interval from enrollment on protocol to progression (1996 NCI-WG criteria), death or last follow-up. Both cCD20 and cCD52 were treated as continuous variables in Cox regression analyses. OS or PFS probabilities were estimated by Kaplan and Meier analyses. The differences in OS or PFS among subgroups of patients were evaluated using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the ability of patient characteristics to predict OS or PFS, with goodness-of-fit assessed by the Grambsch-Therneau test, Schoenfeld residual plots, and martingale residual plots. Predictive variables were transformed as appropriate based on these plots. CART (Categorization and Regression Tree) analysis was used to search for the optimal cutoff values for covariates. Tables I and II contain the full list of variables that were assessed in the univariate Cox models. Only variables with P-value <= 0 05 in the univariate fit were considered for the multivariate models. \",\n"," 'A multivariate Cox model was developed for OS and PFS by performing a backward elimination with P-value cutoff of 0 05, then allowing any variable previously deleted to enter the final model if its P-value was <0 05. Of note, we did not include pre- and post-treatment variables in the same multivariate analyses. Natural logarithmic (Ln)-transformation was used for some variables to minimize skewing of data points. All computations were carried out in S-Plus. Pre-treatment patient characteristics are presented in Table I. Routine blood studies, included blood counts and chemistries, physical examination findings and BM biopsy were evaluated at study entry. Seventy percent of patients were male, Rai stages were well represented, and most patients had a performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. Seventy percent of patients had received <= 2 prior treatments, and 25% and 17% were considered refractory to alkylating agents and fludarabine respectively. Significant differences were noted between BM (median = 100 nmol/l) and peripheral blood cCD20 (median = 257 nmol/l) (P = 0 02, Wilcoxn rank-sum test) as well as peripheral blood cCD20 and cCD52 (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0 54; P-value < 0 001). The majority (63%) of patients completed >= 4 courses of FCR. Responses to treatment are shown in Table II. CR and PR rates were both 30%; nodular PR was seen in 15% of patients. Measures of residual disease, in addition to 1996 NCI-WG response criteria, were used to evaluate patients. Two-colour flow cytometry evaluation of the BM for CD5/CD19 at response assessment or 2 months following the last cycle of FCR for those that did not receive 6 cycles, and PCR for IGHV yielded similar frequencies of patients with MRD (25% vs. 23% respectively). Distribution of cCD20 and cCD52 levels is shown in Table III. The majority of patients had cCD20 and cCD52 values available at the time of response assessment; however, too few patients had pre-treatment values to perform meaningful analyses. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment. The 1st and 3rd quartile values are shown to demonstrate the distribution of cCD20 and cCD52 measurements used in these analyses (Table III). ',\n"," 'For a given patient, there was a significant difference between the BM and blood cCD20 at the time of response assessment (P = 0 02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), but no significant differences were noted for BM and blood cCD52 at the time of response assessment (P = 0 72, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additionally, to determine the correlation between number of FCR cycles and blood cCD20 and cCD52 levels, patients were grouped into 3 categories based on the number of FCR cycles received: (i) <=3 cycles; (ii) 4 or 5 cycles; and (iii) >=6 cycles. There was a significant association between blood cCD20 at the time of response assessment and the number of FCR cycles (P-value = 0 04; Kruskal-Wallis test), but no significant association between blood CD52 at 6 months and the number of FCR cycles (P-value = 0 95; Kruskal-Wallis test). At the time of these analyses, the median follow up time was 75 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 72-81]. One hundred and seventeen patients (66%) of 177 responders (CR, nPR, or PR) have relapsed and the median time to progression was 29 months (95% CI = 27-38 months). Of the 233 patients analysed, 146 patients (63%) have died and the median survival time was 47 months (95% CI = 41-58 months). We determined cutoff values for BM CD52 and CD20, as well as blood CD52 and CD20, and correlated these values with PFS (Fig 1). Cutoff values for BM CD52, BM CD20, blood CD52 and blood CD20 at response assessment were 10, 5, 28 and 179 nmol/l respectively. The cutoff values for cCD20 or cCD52 were chosen using CART (classification and regression tree) analysis, which gives a more robust analysis compared to using median values or quartiles, the latter limited by the small number of patients for whom we had measured values at the indicated quartiles. PFS was significantly longer in patients with lower CD20 and CD52 levels in BM and blood at end of treatment (Fig 1). Although BM CD20 was significant in univariate analysis, it did not achieve statistical significance in the multivariate model. The use of rituximab in the treatment of all patients in this study may have affected the measurement of CD20 and therefore the outcomes of the analysis. ',\n"," 'Survival was correlated with 1996 NCI-WG response status; those who achieved a CR had the longest PFS, while patients with PR had the shorter PFS (data not shown). Similarly, a significantly longer OS was noted in patients who achieved CR/nPR, compared with those who achieved PR. Patients who did not respond to treatment [non-responder/early death (NR/ED)] had the shortest OS (data not shown). Univariate analyses showed the following pretreatment characteristics to be correlated with shorter PFS: advanced age (relative risk (RR) = 1 020; P = 0 02), elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 1 808; P = 0 008) and elevated LDH (RR = 1 733; P = 0 05); smaller spleen size was correlated with longer PFS (RR = 0 948; P = 0 04). Table IVA shows factors evaluated at end of treatment that correlated with longer PFS, namely lower cCD20 and cCD52 in blood and bone marrow and lower level of residual disease by two-colour flow cytometry for CD5/CD19+ cells and PCR for IGHV in bone marrow. Univariate analyses for pretreatment characteristics that correlated with shorter OS were advanced age (RR = 1 035; P <= 0 001); advanced Rai stage (high-risk) (RR = 1 8; P < 0 001); low haemoglobin (RR = 0 86; P <= 0 001); low albumin (RR = 0 62; P = 0 006); elevated alk phos (RR = 1 006; P = 0 03); elevated creatinine (ln Cr) (RR = 2 201; P = 0 03); elevated LDH (RR = 1 87; P = 0 002); elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 2 67; P <= 0 001); more than one prior treatment (RR = 1 47; P = 0 03); and refractoriness to alkylating agents (RR = 1 67; P = 0 007). Table IVB shows factors evaluated at end of treatment that correlated with longer PFS, namely lower cCD52 in bone marrow and lower level of residual disease by two-colour flow cytometry for CD5/CD19+ cells and PCR for IGHV in bone marrow. Multivariate analysis of pre- and post-treatment variables evaluated separately demonstrated that elevated beta2M and splenomegaly were independently associated with shorter PFS (Table V). Shorter PFS was independently associated with an inferior response to treatment (NCI-WG criteria), higher blood cCD20 and cCD52 at end of treatment and higher BM cCD52 at end of treatment (Table V). ',\n"," 'Elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 2 46; P < 0 001), lower albumin level (RR = 0 66; P = 0 05) and refractoriness to alkylating agents (RR = 1 68; P = 0 009) were significant independent pre-treatment predictors for shorter OS in multivariate analysis. The strongest post-treatment predictor for a shorter OS was achievement of PR/NR/ED (versus CR/nPR-1996 NCI-WG response status) (RR = 4 70; P < 0 0001). Neither cCD52 nor cCD20 added to this multivariate model. The lack of association of cCD52 and cCD20 with OS may be attributed to that fact that many patients received subsequent salvage therapy, which can impact survival. cCD20 and cCD52 appear to be important biological markers in CLL. We have previously analysed patient characteristics in this cohort of patients that predict for survival; however, the data presented in this study demonstrate for the first time that cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment are predictors for post-treatment survival (PFS or OS) in CLL patients treated with FCR. Most notably, BM and blood cCD52 as well as blood cCD20 at response assessment were independent predictors for PFS in patients treated with FCR. Although our data seem to validate previously reported pre-treatment clinical and laboratory parameters as being significant prognostic factors for patients with CLL, this is the first report to describe that cCD20 and cCD52 at response assessment are important predictors of disease outcomes in CLL. Prior reports demonstrated the prognostic significance of both cCD20 and cCD52 in patients with lymphoid malignancies. showed that cCD52 was detectable at baseline in plasma from patients with CLL and that higher levels significantly correlated with advanced Rai stage, higher beta2M, immunoglobulin mutation status, and worse survival. Similarly, higher baseline cCD20 levels in plasma were shown to correlate positively with beta2M, leukaemia cell expression of CD38, advanced stage disease (Rai and Binet), and significantly shorter survival. In patients with non-Hodgkin (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma, pre- and post-treatment levels of serum cCD52 had no predictive value for survival, while post- treatment serum cCD20 levels were highly correlated with survival in NHL patients. Our results further extend these findings, specifically highlighting the prognostic value of cCD20 and cCD52 at the time of response assessment following therapy with FCR in previously treated patients. ',\n"," \"Unlike the aforementioned report examining post-treatment cCD20 and cCD52 levels, where patients were treated with various regimens not including rituximab or alemtuzumab, all patients included in our study were treated uniformly with FCR. Furthermore, we did not use previously reported cutoff values for cCD20 and cCD52 in our analyses but examined values at the time of response assessment and general trends over time. In fact, the median values measured in our studies for cCD52 and cCD20 were much lower than those previously reported (1875 nmol/l and 2336 nmol/l for cCD20 and cCD52 respectively); this is probably secondary to our reported values representing post-treatment cCD20 and cCD52. Previously well-documented prognostic factors including age, haemoglobin, beta2M, and NCI-WG response status were confirmed in our analyses. Although BM samples may be more difficult to obtain in clinical practice, BM values are part of the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria, and therefore BM cCD20 and cCD52 were included in our study. cCD20 and cCD52 levels were correlated with PFS in multivariate analysis (Table V). Continued follow up may demonstrate that cCD20 and cCD52 are important prognostic factors for OS, even though they were not significantly correlated with OS in this analysis. In addition to cCD20 and cCD52, our results also showed PCR for IGHV to be a significant prognostic factor in previously treated patients, with higher levels correlated with shorter survival. Detection of IGHV is a sensitive marker of residual disease, and may signify failure of FCR to fully eradicate the malignant clones. Nevertheless, when used simultaneously with cCD52 and cCD20 in the multivariate analysis models (Table V), IGHV lost its significance as a predictor of PFS (versus cCD20 or cCD52), thereby indicating that, in comparison with IGHV, cCD20 and cCD52 may be better prognostic factors for PFS. In addition to PFS and OS, we also analysed the association of CD5/CD19, cCD20 and cCD52 levels with MRD. There was a significant association between CD5/CD19 level (categorized as low, intermediate and high) and PCR for MRD (P = 0 0002, Fisher's exact test) as well as a significant association between blood (P = 0 03, Kruskal-Wallis test) and BM (P = 0 006, Kruskal-Wallis test) cCD52 at response assessment and PCR for MRD (data not shown). \",\n"," 'There were no significant associations between PCR for MRD and blood (P = 0 65, Kruskal-Wallis test) and BM (P = 0 56, Kruskal-Wallis test) cCD20 levels at response assessment (data not shown). We are prospectively studying the role of CD20 and CD52 in the detection of MRD, in comparison with the more standard approaches, which include four-colour flow cytometry (CD5, CD19, CD43 and CD20) and allele-specific PCR. In summary, cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment had prognostic value in previously treated patients receiving FCR and potentially other treatment regimens. Elevated cCD20 or cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment following treatment with FCR indicate higher likelihood for relapse or shorter survival; in such cases additional treatment may be warranted. ',\n"," 'Alemtuzumab is highly effective at treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in bone marrow, which is the usual site of residual disease after fludarabine-based treatment. Eliminating residual disease potentially is associated with longer remission and overall survival. The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease. Patients in partial remission (PR), nodular PR (nPR), or complete remission (CR) who had disease in bone marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks, and patients had the option to self-administer alemtuzumab. Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR, patients in nPR who converted to a CR, and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment. There were 31 patients enrolled, of whom 29 were evaluable, and there were 23 responders (4 of 4 patients who achieved a CR, 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR, and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR. Non-responders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment. Furthermore, higher plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration. Compared with the results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was a trend toward a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab. The current results demonstrated that self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to monitor in future alemtuzumab consolidation trials. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who achieve complete remission (CR) or nodular partial remission (nPR) according to 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria have longer remission duration and survival than patients who achieve partial remission (PR) or who fail to respond to treatment. Molecular analysis for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene and 4-color flow cytometry analysis are more sensitive than morphologic evaluation of the bone marrow used to establish CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. A study by Moreton et al of alemtuzumab administered to previously treated patients with CLL demonstrated that those who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-free status according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis had longer survival. This suggested that evaluating for MDR-free status could add to response evaluation. ',\n"," 'Studies in fludarabine-refractory, previously treated, and treatment-naive patients with CLL clearly demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous alemtuzumab. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab is effective in fludarabine-refractory patients and as initial treatment for patients with CLL. Previously, we reported results from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of alemtuzumab intravenously 3 times weekly for 4 to 8 weeks in eliminating residual disease after treatment with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. That study demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% in 41 patients; the median response duration was not reached at a median follow-up of 18 months. Here, we report the results with subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease and include a retrospective evaluation of bone marrow for MRD by 4-color flow cytometry analysis and end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels. Furthermore, we compare outcomes between the subcutaneous alemtuzumab group and an updated historic group of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab. This was a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the CLL Research Consortium. Patients were enrolled from March 2005 to May 2007, including 16 patients at The University of Texas M. Anderson Cancer Center, 11 patients at University of California-San Diego, and 4 patients at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. All respective institutional review boards approved the protocol and the informed consent form. All participants provided informed consent according to institutional guidelines. Patients with CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia were aged >18 years, had a performance status between 0 and 2, had adequate liver and kidney function (creatinine, total bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels all <=2 times the upper limit of normal), and achieved CR, nPR, or PR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria with their most recent treatment. Patients in CR were required to have a residual population of cluster of differentiation 5 (CD5)-positive/CD19-positive cells that comprised >=10% of the bone marrow mononuclear population or CD5-positive/CD19-positive cells that comprised <10% of the bone marrow mononuclear population with a kappa/lambda ratio of >6 or <0.33, respectively. Patients were excluded for active infection, history of anaphylaxis with rodent-derived monoclonal antibodies, prior treatment with alemtuzumab, pregnancy, corticosteroids, and uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Patients could not have received treatment for CLL within 2 months of enrollment; there was no upper limit for the time from last chemotherapy. The trial intended to enroll 25 patients in nPR or PR and 25 patients in CR. ',\n"," 'accrue and, as a result, was closed. The current analysis includes 26 patients who were enrolled in the nPR/PR group and 5 patients who were enrolled in the CR group. Patients were registered in the CLL Research Consortium database, and all data were collected through the web-based clinical database system. Upon enrollment, patients underwent complete history and physical examination, pretreatment laboratory evaluation (including blood chemistries and blood count), and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Some patients had prognostic factors evaluated, including IGHV mutation status and leukemia cell expression of zeta chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) and CD38 (in respective clinical laboratories), by flow cytometry. Treatment consisted of single-agent, subcutaneous alemtuzumab at doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on Days 1, 2, and 3, respectively, followed by 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for a total of 12 doses, including the initial dose escalation. The research nurses with previously prepared educational materials taught patients self-administration. Once patients demonstrated self-administration to the staff, this was continued for the duration of treatment. Dosing, injection site, and toxicities were documented by patients with diaries, which were submitted for review and documentation at the end of treatment. Premedications consisted of 25 mg to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 650 mg oral acetaminophen. In addition, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily, 3 times weekly, or he equivalent for Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis and valacyclovir 500 mg daily or valganciclovir 450 mg twice daily for viral prophylaxis were given for the duration of treatment and for a minimum of 3 months after completing alemtuzumab. Responses to treatment were assessed within 4 weeks of the end of treatment, and patients could receive a second 4-week course if residual disease was documented at their first response assessment. Criteria for response were as follows: Patients who enrolled in CR were considered responders if they had no disease detected on 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analyses after treatment; specifically, 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analysis could not demonstrate any kappa:lambda skewing (3:1 or 1:3) regardless of the proportion of cells that coexpressed CD5 and CD19. For patients who enrolled in nPR, responders must have achieved CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who enrolled in PR, responders must have achieved either nPR or CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab, response was assessed after the second course. ',\n"," 'Patients had a physician visit at least every 3 months after response assessment and underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at least every 6 months to evaluate for loss of response. Time to loss of response and survival were dated from study enrollment. Loss of response was defined for patients who enrolled in CR as the loss of 2-color flow cytometry response in bone marrow, or developing nodules, or >=30% lymphocytes in bone marrow, or lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly; for patients who enrolled in nPR, loss of response was defined as redeveloping criteria for nPR or for PR; and, for patients who enrolled in PR, loss of response was defined as redeveloping criteria for PR. Plasma alemtuzumab levels were assessed retrospectively at the end of treatment using the flow cytometry-based method developed by Rebello and Hale. Bone marrow samples that were cryopreserved at response assessment were evaluated retrospectively for MRD by standardized 4-color flow cytometry (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, Mass). Patients also were evaluated for antialemtuzumab antibodies (BioAnalab Limited, Oxford Science Park, United Kingdom), and none were positive after treatment (data not shown). We previously conducted a trial of intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease that enrolled 41 patients. The trial was revised to enroll an additional 17 patients among CLL Research Consortium clinical sites. We updated follow-up of all 58 patients to include response duration and survival (Table 1). This group was used as an historic intravenous alemtuzumab comparison group. Associations between categorical patient characteristics were evaluated with the Fisher exact test. Comparisons of measured data between the subcutaneous cohort and the intravenous cohort, as well as comparisons between responders and nonresponders, used either the 2-sample t test or its nonparametric alternative, the Wilcoxon ranksum test. The distribution of time to loss of response and survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier curves for categorical variables were plotted for recurrence-free survival. The P values for testing differences between subgroups/levels for each variable were calculated by using log-rank tests. Time intervals were measured from the first day of treatment until progression, recurrence, or death; and deaths from all causes were included. There were 31 patients enrolled who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab, including 17 patients in PR, 9 patients in nPR, and 5 patients in CR (Table 1). ',\n"," 'The median age was 65 years (range, 48-84 years), the median number of previous treatments was 1 (range, 1-6 previous treatments), and the time from last treatment to alemtuzumab was 7.6 months (range, 2-45 months). All patients who had previously received a fludarabine-based regimen were at least 4 months from treatment (data not shown). Enrollment status according to the last treatment regimen and response to that regimen are shown in Table 2. The ORR was 74% (90% exact binomial confidence interval, 58%-86%). Seven patients received a second alemtuzumab course (Table 3). There was 1 death (a patient in PR) that occurred within 1 month of the last alemtuzumab dose because of refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and 1 patient was lost to followup (a patient in CR); neither patient could be evaluated for response, and both were included in the denominator for ORR. All 4 evaluable patients who enrolled in CR were responders to subcutaneous alemtuzumab according to specified criteria (Table 4). Eight of 9 patients who enrolled in nPR and 11 of 17 patients who enrolled in PR responded to subcutaneous alemtuzumab treatment. Four-color flow cytometry analysis was performed retrospectively on cryopreserved bone marrow samples that were obtained at response assessment for 22 of the evaluable patients (Table 4). Two of 4 patients who enrolled in CR had post-treatment bone marrow MR Devaluations, and neither was MRD-negative at end of treatment. Twenty-nine percent of 7 patients who enrolled in nPR and 18% of 13 patients who enrolled in PR were MRD-negative according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis at response assessment. Alemtuzumab therapy was highly effective at eliminating morphologic evidence of residual disease from blood and bone marrow and was less effective at treating residual lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1). The median plasma alemtuzumab concentration at the end of treatment was significantly higher (P = .003) for responders (n = 19; mean concentration, 9.3 microg/mL) than for nonresponders (n = 6; mean concentration, 0.1 microg/mL) (Fig. 2). Among the responders who were evaluated, the end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab concentration was correlated with response duration (Fig. 3A). The overall median plasma level was 6 microg/mL. Significantly longer response duration was observed for responders who had alemtuzumab levels above the median (P = .05). ',\n"," 'The mean alemtuzumab plasma concentration at the end of treatment for the 19 patients who received 1 course of alemtuzumab was 7.7 +- 4.7 microg/mL compared with 2.6 +- 3.8 microg/mL for the 6 patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab. The response rate for the 6 patients who received 2 courses was 50% versus 84% for the 19 patients who received 1 course of subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Responses were evaluated according to pretreatment prognostic factor status, and none of the factors correlated with response or response duration, possibly because of the small patient numbers (Table 5). The median followup is 31 months, and the median response duration is 13 months. Five patients have died, including 1 patient with refractory AIHA, as mentioned above, and 4 patients during follow-up 27 to 31 months after treatment on this study, all with progressive, refractory CLL. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 6). Patients were able to self-administer alemtuzumab without complication or difficulties, as documented by their diaries. Injection site reactions (grade 1 or 2), consisting of erythema, pruritus, and induration that typically lasted 2 or 3 days with complete resolution, were reported by 24 patients (most were grade 1). Four patients experienced serious infections associated with neutropenia; 2 patients developed pneumonia, 1 patient developed gram-positive bacteremia, and 1 patient developed fever of unknown origin. All serious infections occurred within 2 months of completing alemtuzumab and were not associated with plasma alemtuzumab levels greater than the median (6 microg/mL) at the end of treatment. Two patients developed symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation that required ganciclovir treatment, and 1 patient developed a fever and was treated empirically for presumed CMV reactivation. Hematologic toxicities consisted of neutropenia, which was grade 3 in 19% of patients and grade 4 in 19% of patients. Grade 3 anemia was noted in 3% of patients, and no grade >=3 thrombocytopenia was observed. These hematologic toxicities were attributed to treatment with alemtuzumab and were not associated with increased end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels (Table 6). There were 4 serious adverse events, all of which occurred at the end of alemtuzumab treatment or within 1 month of completion. One patient developed uncontrolled hemolytic anemia during treatment and died (Table 6), as mentioned above. One patient developed neutropenic fever and was admitted to the hospital; blood cultures grew Staphylococcus hominis, and the infection was treated and resolved. ',\n"," 'One patient was admitted and treated with empiric antibiotics for neutropenic fever. Radiographs revealed no source of infection, and cultures remained negative; the fever resolved with antibiotics (Table 6). The same patient experienced a second event of pneumonia with an infiltrate observed on a chest x-ray in the setting of neutropenia that was treated and resolved. There were no reported late infections or infection-related deaths. Response and response duration, as defined for the subcutaneous population, for 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease was updated (Table 1). The characteristics of this group were similar to those of the 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab with the after noted differences: The intravenous group received fewer courses of alemtuzumab, was younger, had lower platelet count, and had higher beta-2 microglobulin levels at enrollment (Table 1). The proportion of patients with lymphadenopathy before alemtuzumab was similar between the groups (Table 1). Among the patients who had lymphadenopathy, 60% of those in the subcutaneous group and 52% of those in the intravenous group had more than 1 involved lymph node site. Furthermore, the largest lymph node measured >=2 cm in 50% of those in the subcutaneous group and in 31% of those in the intravenous group. The ORR using the same criteria was lower (P = .07) for the patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab (Table 1). However, among the responders, the proportion of patients who had MRD-negative bone marrow status was significantly higher (P = .005) in the intravenous group, although the method used to evaluate MRD differed between trials; 4-color flow cytometry analysis was used in the subcutaneous trial, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for the clonal IGHV gene was used in the intravenous trial. There was a trend (P = .07) for shorter response duration, when using the same criteria for both trials, for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab (median response duration, 13 months vs 31 months, respectively) (Fig. 3B). There was no difference in overall survival between the trials at the most recent follow-up (data not shown). Investigators have evaluated strategies to achieve MRD-free status by incorporating alemtuzumab into the approach with the expectation that this may translate into longer remission duration and survival. The phase 3 trial of the German CLL Study Group clearly demonstrated longer progression-free survival for patients who received alemtuzumab. ',\n"," 'That trial demonstrated a high response rate of 74%, although the response duration was disappointing. There was an apparently shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab compared with the that reported in the historic intravenous trial. The characteristics of the patients were similar in our historic comparison group, making it less likely that the shorter response duration was caused by differences in patient characteristics. The shorter response may have been caused by the reduced ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to clear MRD when given for the defined treatment period. In both trials, patients received a 4-week course of alemtuzumab (12 doses) with the option for a second 4-week course for patients who had residual CLL after the first course. Fewer patients received a second course of alemtuzumab on the intravenous trial. Also, the proportion of responders who were negative for MRD was lower for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab. One difficulty in interpreting this observation is that the methods for evaluating MRD were different between trials. For the subcutaneous trial, 4-color flow cytometry was used to evaluate MRD, which potentially has different sensitivity than the PCR-based assay that was used to evaluate patients in the intravenous trial. Also, these trials were not contemporaneous but sequential; therefore, unappreciated trial effects may account in part for the differences in response duration between the patient populations. A major concern for the use of alemtuzumab in residual disease is infection, including CMV reactivation and opportunistic infections. The German CLL Study Group had to terminate their phase 3 trial, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B terminated their phase 2 trial of alemtuzumab for MRD, both because of unacceptable, infection-related toxicity. One possible explanation for this observation was a shorter duration between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that alemtuzumab can be self-administered safely by patients with residual disease, with the expected reactivation of CMV in a minority of patients. The incidence of symptomatic CMV reactivation on this trial was lower than previously reported, likely because some patients received valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis. Reactivation of CMV can be minimized, if not eliminated, with prophylactic valganciclovir. It is possible that trials of alemtuzumab for residual disease that reported serious and, in some cases, fatal infectious complications were the result of allowing too little time for immune reconstitution between fludarabine-based chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. ',\n"," 'In our previous trial of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in the current trial with 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was no treatment-related, infectious mortality. The median time from fludarabine-based therapy to alemtuzumab was >6 months, and we recommend waiting at least 4 to 6 months before initiating alemtuzumab to minimize infectious complications. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to report the self-administration of subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Patients were taught to self-administer alemtuzumab and were able to complete the treatment without complication or incident. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab was associated with local injection-site reactions, but these were mild and were minimized by supportive measures, such as applying ice before and after the injection and administering acetaminophen and diphenhydramine premedication. In the current trial, plasma alemtuzumab levels were correlated with response and response duration. There are limited reports of single-agent alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics. It is noteworthy that Hale et al evaluated the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in 30 patients with recurrent disease who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in 20 untreated patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Their analysis indicated significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters; however, the mean cumulative dose of alemtuzumab that was needed to reach a trough serum concentration of 1 microg/mL was 90mg for the intravenous group and was substantially higher at 551 mg for the subcutaneous group. Furthermore, higher trough serum alemtuzumab concentrations were correlated significantly with a better clinical response and with achieving MRD-free status. Montillo et al evaluated pharmacokinetics in 16 patients who received alemtuzumab 10 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6 weeks as treatment for residual disease. Their data indicated that patients who achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on Day 15 of therapy that was >5 microg hour/mL were more likely to achieve CR compared with individuals who had lower levels. In our study, patients who did not achieve a response had lower plasma levels of alemtuzumab at the end of treatment compared with responders. Furthermore, among the responders, those with end-of-treatment alemtuzumab levels lower than the median of 6 microg/mL had significantly shorter response duration than patients who had levels higher than the median. ',\n"," 'Given the significantly higher cumulative dose of subcutaneous alemtuzumab needed to achieve blood concentrations associated with response, we hypothesize that optimized treatment and improved safety and responses, specifically MRD-free status, could be achieved better by evaluating for MRD in a real-time fashion and administering individualized alemtuzumab subcutaneously or intravenously based on blood levels. Because blood reveals only 1 disease compartment, a time factor to allow for compartment equilibration is yet another consideration. Further work to optimize this treatment strategy may make use of a new trial design in which patients have blood alemtuzumab levels measured and undergo real-time evaluations for MRD. Patients could begin with a 4-week course (12 doses of 30 mg) of subcutaneous alemtuzumab followed by evaluations of response, MRD, and blood drug levels. For patients with residual disease, treatment could continue, and the subcutaneous alemtuzumab dose or schedule could be adjusted, depending on blood drug levels; then, treatment would continue with monthly bone marrow evaluations either until patients achieved negative MRD status or a predetermined total duration of treatment is reached for patients who remain positive with potentially adequate blood alemtuzumab levels. This remains an interesting, active, and promising therapeutic strategy for patients with CLL. ',\n"," 'Flavopiridol and lenalidomide have activity in refractory CLL without immunosuppression or opportunistic infections seen with other therapies. We hypothesized that flavopiridol treatment could adequately de-bulk disease prior to lenalidomide therapy, decreasing the incidence of tumor flare with higher doses of lenalidomide. In this Phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached with treatment consisting of flavopiridol 30 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (IVB) + 30 mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) cycle (C) 1 day (D) 1 and 30 mg/m2 IVB + 50 mg/m2 CIVI C1 D8,15 and C2-8 D3,10,17 with lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily C2-8 D1-21. There was no unexpected toxicity seen, including no increased tumor lysis, tumor flare (even at higher doses of lenalidomide) or opportunistic infection. Significant clinical activity was demonstrated, with a 51% response rate in this group of heavily pretreated patients. Biomarker testing confirmed association of mitochondrial priming of the BH3 only peptide Puma with response. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia, characterized by leukemic cells accumulating secondary to survival and proliferation signals delivered to the cells. CLL has been increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease, with many patients being observed for several years after diagnosis prior to disease progression requiring therapy. Certain disease characteristics such as high-risk interphase cytogenetic abnormalities (del17p13 and del11q22) and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain-variable status are associated with a more rapid progression and inferior survival. Despite the improvement in overall response rates with the current standard treatment using combination chemoimmunotherapy, patients with the mentioned high-risk characteristics continue to have shorter time to progression with conventional therapies and lower response rates with repeated therapy. CLL cell survival has been attributed to a role of proliferation and also disordered apoptosis, with constitutive expression of different anti-apoptotic proteins including BCl2, MCL1 and XIAP. Contributions of the microenvironment and aberrations in innate immune response are recognized as CLL survival mechanisms. Significant survival signals are derived from both direct contact of CLL cells with stromal cells and cytokines, making development of novel therapeutics targeting the molecular alterations preventing apoptosis and the immunoregulatory defects interesting therapeutic targets. Two promising agents that either down-regulate MCL-1 or favorably enhance immune effector cell function include lenalidomide and flavopiridol. Both drugs have shown single agent activity in phase I and II trials in this population of patients. ',\n"," \"Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved for the treatment of 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma with activity in other hematologic malignancies including CLL. Lenalidomide does not promote direct cytotoxicity to CLL cells but does alter the microenvironment and immune regulation. Lenalidomide promotes cellular and innate immune activation, activates T-cells and natural killer cells altering the tumor microenvironment and down-regulates critical pro-survival cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The optimal dose and schedule of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory CLL patients is controversial due to the risks of tumor flare reaction and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Two phase II trials with single agent lenalidomide administered at doses of 10-25 mg daily in relapsed/refractory CLL reported response rates ranging from 32-47% with clinical activity in patients with high-risk cytogenetics and/or bulky disease. Tumor flare was reported in 30-58% of these patients and two cases of TLS were reported at the 25 mg daily dose. A phase 2/3 study was planned to address the question of optimal dosing comparing 10 mg versus 25 mg orally daily for 21 of 28 days; however, after four patients experienced sever tumor flare and /or TLS, the study was amended to a phase 1 trial with intra-patient-dose escalation with lenalidomide given at 2.5 mg initially, increasing to 5 mg after 28 days with subsequent 5 mg incremental increases to 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg. In that study, one-third of the patients could not escalate beyond 2.5 mg, and the response rate was only 11.5%, much lower than previously described. Flavopiridol is a broad cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, that directly antagonizes cell cycle CDK's (CDK 1 and 2) and those involved in transcription initiation (CDK 7 and 8) and elongation (CDK9). Flavopiridol induced apoptosis in CLL cell lines and primary human CLL cells, which was independent of p53. Flavopiridol also globally inhibits gene transcription, potentially leading to down-regulation of several important intracellular proteins in CLL including Mcl-1 and XIAP. Despite promising pre-clinical data, initial clinical trials of flavopiridol using a 72-hour continuous infusion, 24-hour continuous infusion and 1-hour bolus infusion were disappointing with limited clinical efficacy, likely due to plasma protein binding and sub-optimal exposure of free drug. \",\n"," 'scheduling to a 30-minute bolus (IVB) followed by 4-hour continuous infusion (CIV) weekly improved efficacy in a Phase I trial with 42 patients enrolled in 3 separate cohorts. Nineteen (45%) patients achieved a partial response to therapy with responses noted in the high risk patients, including 51% of patients with bulky lymphadenopathy, 42% of those with del(17p13.1) and 72% of those with del(11q22.3). The dose limiting toxicity was acute TLS requiring dialysis, occurring in 14% of patients, but 63% of those with WBC > 200x109/L. A Phase II trial followed, restricting eligibility to patients with < 200x109/L and using aggressive TLS prophylaxis with hydration, rasburicase, IV dexamethasone, frequent monitoring for and treatment of hyperkalemia. A total of 64 patients were enrolled with only 4 patients not being treated with dose escalation for severe TLS, 3 of those requiring hemodialysis. Thirty-four (53%) patients achieved a response to therapy with 12 (57%) of patients with del(17p13.1) and 14(50%) of patients with del(11q22.3) responding. Subsequent data analysis from these earlier trials evaluating flavopiridol in relapsed or refractory CLL patients identified female sex, bulky lymphadenopathy, high WBC, beta-2-microglobulin, and high exposure to flavopiridol-glucuronide as risk factors for TLS. Flavopiridol plasma exposure was only weakly associated with response. It is unclear if Mcl-1 down-regulation is solely responsible for the rapid tumor cell death observed in a subset of CLL patients or if other factors are important, such as priming for early mitochondrial damage. Given the promising efficacy of both of these agents in high risk and refractory patients coupled with the fact that neither agent was immunosuppressive nor associated with opportunistic infections, we elected to perform a phase I trial evaluating the potential synergy of direct flavopiridol-induced CLL cell cytotoxicity with indirect lenalidomide immunomodulatory effects. Based on the apparent opposite mechanisms for severe toxicities (i.e. tumor flare for lenalidomide vs. TLS for flavopirodol), we hypothesized dosing with single agent flavopiridol during cycle 1 with the established phase II dose would sufficiently de-bulk patients thus reducing risk for tumor flare when combined with escalating doses of lenalidomide in later cycles. Finally, we retrospectively evaluated several factors as potential biomarkers for outcomes from this combined therapy, including mitochondrial profiling of BH3-domain proteins, a functional assay surrogate for cellular ability to respond to pro-apoptotic cues. ',\n"," 'All patients were enrolled and treated on the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored (NCI 8046, U01CA076576, NCT00735930) and The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSU) institutional review board-approved phase I trial of flavopiridol in combination with lenalidomide in previously treated CLL. Written informed consent approved by The Ohio State University Human Studies committee was obtained for all patients prior to study entry. The study enrolled adult patients (>= 18 years of age) with relapsed and refractory CLL that required therapy by the IWCLL 2008 criteria. Other eligibility included: at least one prior therapy that included fludarabine unless a contra-indication existed; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <= 2; normal organ and marrow function; no active infection. The study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of flavopiridol and lenalidomide in this population of patients. Due to potential risks of coincident tumor flare and TLS from flavopiridol and lenalidomide administered concomitantly, flavopiridol was administered alone during cycle 1 to cytoreduce patients prior to combination therapy with the two agents during cycles 2-8 (Table 1). Combination therapy and dose escalation was started with the initiation of cycle 2 (Day 29). A standard 3+3 phase I design was used with 3-6 patients enrolled at each dose level with dose escalation starting during cycle 2 (Table 2). Patients were required to complete 2 cycles of therapy with < 2 patients experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) prior to dose escalation to the next dose level. DLT was defined during cycle 2 of protocol treatment (Supplemental Table 1). To minimize risk of TLS, the first dose of flavopiridol on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and day 3 of cycle 2 was administered in the hospital with standard supportive care measures and monitoring for TLS. On days 15 of cycle 1, days 10 and 17 of cycle 2 and days 3, 10 and 17 of cycles 3-8, flavopiridol was administered in the outpatient clinic provided no serious adverse events were noted with the first dose. During cycles 2-8, lenalidomide was administered orally on days 1-21, with flavopiridol dosing immediately after lenalidomide on days 3, 10 and 17. Cycle 1 was defined as 28 days and starting with cycle 2, each cycle was defined as 35 days. Patients who developed a DVT were allowed to continue protocol therapy, but were treated with a low molecular weight heparin. ',\n"," 'In patients who were unable to receive anti-coagulation due to contra-indication (i.e. the platelet count was < 50,000/mm3 or serious bleeding occurred), pulmonary embolism occurred, or a DVT recurred despite anti-coagulation, were removed from protocol therapy. Rasburicase (4.5 mg) was administered two hours prior to flavopiridol on day 1 of cycle 1 and day 3 of cycle 2 with remaining doses left to the discretion of the treating physician. Potassium monitoring was done every two hours prior to, during and one hour following treatment. Dexamethasone 20 mg orally was administered 30 minutes prior to each dose of flavopiridol and 4 mg 24 hours after each dose to prevent flavopiridol-related cytokine mediated infusion reactions. Additional corticosteroids were used at the discretion of the treating physician for patients with flavopiridol-related cytokine release or lenalidomide induced tumor flare. Anti-emetic therapy with ondansetron 8 mg orally was given 30 min prior to each flavopiridol treatment. GCSF (Neulasta) 6mg SQ was administered on day 16 of cycle 1 and day 18 of cycles 2-8. Prophylactic antiviral and antibiotic therapy including valacyclovir, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole DS were continued throughout protocol therapy. DLT was defined during cycle 2 of treatment. Those patients experiencing DLT during cycle 1, who had TLS, or who were unable or unwilling to proceed to cycle 2 were replaced. DLT was defined as the occurrence of any of the following events when considered possibly, probably or definitely related to the study treatment including 1) treatment delays > 14 days for any non-hematologic or hematologic toxicity or any grade 5 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity; 2) hematologic toxicities including grade 4 febrile neutropenia or infection, grade 3 febrile neutropenia or infection with fever or infection that fails to resolve within 7 days, or ANC < 1000/mm3 or platelets < 30,000/mm3 > 14 days after the completion of cycle 1 or 2 (i.e. day 44 or later after cycle 1 or day 51 or later after cycle 2); and 3) any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity. The following were not considered DLT: TLS, tumor flare reaction, cytokine release syndrome, alopecia, DVT responsive to anticoagulation, diarrhea responsive to medical treatment, and nausea and vomiting controllable with steroids and anti-emetic therapy, transient grade 3 and 4 electrolyte or liver function test (AST, ALT, total bilirubin) abnormalities that resolve <= grade 1 in <= 7 days. ',\n"," \"The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 was used for toxicity grading. Response was assessed by the revised National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group Guidelines for CLL. Response was evaluated after cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 (during days 22-35 of each cycle). Pharmacokinetic evaluations were conducted in collaboration with the Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource at OSU. Pharmacokinetic assessments of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite were completed on cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 2 day 3. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 4.5, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the start of flavopiridol infusion. Pharmacokinetic assessments of lenalidomide were completed during cycle 2 on days 2 and 3. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8 and 24 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of lenalidomide, flavopiridol and flavopiridol glucuronide were simultaneously determined using previously published LC-MS/MS methods. The primary endpoint of the study was to define the MTD of the combination of flavopiridol and lenalidomide using the standard 3+3 phase I design as described above and to define the specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicities of this combination in this population of patients. Common toxicities are summarized with frequency by dose level and for all patients. Baseline characteristics are described using frequencies and medians with ranges for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. PFS was measured from the date on study to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were still alive and didn't have disease progression were censored at the last visit for PFS. OS was determined from the date of study to the date of death from any cause or date of observation. Patients who were still alive were censored at the last visit. Survival curves were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed in Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3.0.395 and resulting parameters summarized in graphic and tabular format. Thawed aliquots of pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells containing CLL cells were purified for untouched B-cells by non-B-cell depletion using a cocktail of biotinylated monoclonal Abs (CD2, CD4, CD11b, CD16, CD36, Anti-IgE, and CD235a (glycophorin) and magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Of 32 patients treated with lenalidomide and flavopiridol, specimens were available and assessed for 26. \",\n"," 'The extent of cell purification was monitored by flow cytometry of stained cells before and after purification with anti-CD19-APC and anti-biotin antibody-FITC for the presence of non-B cells labeled with MAbs from depletion cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Specimens (2x105 cells/assay) were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated with JC-1 mitochondrial dye and 100 microM BH3 peptides (Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bmf, Hrk; Bim and Puma were also assayed at 0.1 microM and 10 microM, respectively) or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO [(1%]) or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP [10 microM]). Samples were run in triplicate and fluorescent traces of JC-1 dye monitored over 300 min of assay. Area under the curve was integrated relative to the positive control uncoupling reagent after normalization for DMSO background: Association between biomarker status (% priming) and clinical response classification was by Mann-Whitney Test. We pre-determined a statistical analysis plan with significance of p<0.05. Marker predictive ability was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Analyses utilized SAS software, version 9.2 (Cary, NC), R version 2.14.2 (Vienna, Austria), and/or Graphpad Prism version 5.04 (La Jolla, CA). A total of 39 patients were treated on Cohorts 1 (n=8), Cohort 2 (n=9), Cohort 3 (n=4), Cohort 4 (n=4), Cohort 5 (n=10), Cohort 6 (n=4) (Table 2). Median age was 62 years (range 26-74) and there was a male predominance (26). Median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1-10). Patients had the following high-risk features: del(17p13.1) in 22 patients; del(11q22.3) in 15 patients; complex karyotype in 31 patients; fludarabine refractory in 14 patients. Baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 3. Dose limiting toxicities occurred in three patients and included Grade 3-4 transaminitis in two patients, one at dose level 1 and one at dose level two, and grade 3 absolute neutrophil count lasting greater than 14 days in one patient at dose level 5. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hematologic: neutropenia (n=32 or 82%), anemia (n=16 or 41%), thrombocytopenia (n=20 or 51%) and lymphopenia (n=9 or 23%); gastrointestinal: diarrhea (n=18 or 46%); metabolic: transaminitis (n=17 or 44%), hypophosphatemia (n=12 or 31%), hypocalcemia (n=6 or 15%); hypokalemia (n=11 or 28%), hyperkalemia (n=6 or 15%); hyperglycemia (n=17 or 44%) and TLS (n=10 or 26%). TLS occurred only during cycle 1, and three of the patients with TLS were replaced. There was only one patient with Grade 3 tumor flare. ',\n"," 'This patient had lenalidomide held for painful splenomegaly on day 10 of cycle 2 until cycle 3 and was treated with three days of steroids with lenalidomide dose reduced to 7.5 mg for cycle 3. The patient had recurrence of painful splenomegaly on day 10 of cycle 3, and lenalidomide was held again with two days of steroid treatment given. When lenalidomide was restarted at 7.5 mg, the patient again had recurrence of symptoms in four days and was removed from study. A total of fifteen patients required dose reductions. Grade 3-4 adverse events are summarized in Table 4. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine patients were evaluable for response completing at least two cycles. Of the eight patients that were not evaluable for response 2 had progressive disease in cycle 1, 3 were replaced for TLS in cycle 1, 1 had thrombocytopenia after cycle 1 whose platelet count did not recover to > 30,000 prior to cycle 2, and 2 had DLT with transaminitis during cycle 2. Of the thirty-one evaluable patients there was a 51% overall response rate, all of which were partial responses. Of the 22 patients with del(17p13.1), 11 (50%) of patients responded and of the 14 patients with del(11q22.3), 10 (71%) responded. These factors associated with inferior outcome to standard therapy did not show a statistically significant association with response (p value 0.62, 0.14 respectively). Median PFS for all patients was 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.7-11.2). Median PFS for patients with del(17p13.1) was 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.5-13.0) versus 8.6 months (95% CI: 3.0-16.0) for patients without del(17p13.1), showing PFS is not significantly associated with del(17p13.1) (p-value=0.71). Seven patients went on to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Of these seven patients, one was lost to follow-up; one had graft failure with multi-organ failure due to complications and died at 2 months post-transplant; one progressed within 6 months of transplant and died of infectious complications at 11 months post-transplant; one relapsed at 12 months post-transplant and went on to receive three other therapies prior to dying of infectious complications 32 months post-transplant; and at last follow-up three were still alive and without evidence of disease at 35, 37, and 38 months post-transplant. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for flavopiridol pharmacokinetics on cycle 1 day 1 and thirty-two on cycle 2 day 3 (Figure 1). ',\n"," 'Pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide were evaluable for thirty-one patients on cycle 2 day 2 and thirty-two patients on cycle 2 day 3. Average observed maximum concentrations (Cmax) of lenalidomide reached 0.97uM, and the average observed Cmax of flavopiridol was 3.50uM (Figure 1 and Supplemental Material Figure 1). Non-compartmental parameter estimates for clearance, Cmax and volume of distribution were consistent with previously reported values (Table 5). When flavopiridol and lenalidomide were administered in combination, PK plots and parameter estimates of lenalidomide were consistent with those for lenalidomide alone (Supplemental Table 2). At 60 mg/m2, flavopiridol AUC (p=0.03) and Cmax (p=0.01) tended to increase when lenalidomide dose was increased, as shown in Supplemental Table 3. However, this trend was not observed at the higher 80 mg/m2 flavopiridol dose. Flavopiridol-glucuronide data was available from 30 patients. Of the 10 patients with TLS, flavopiridol-glucuronide data was available for 8 patients (data not shown). No trends or significant associations were observed between plasma flavopiridol-glucuronide pharmacokinetics and TLS. From 32 study participants who would be treated with flavopiridol and lenalidomide, aliquots of pre-treatment specimens were available from 26 with defined evaluable outcomes (median age of 60 years [range: 26-74 years]). Specimens were thawed and exposed in vitro to individual BH3 peptides, including an activator (Bim) and several sensitizers (Noxa, Puma, Bad, Hrk) as surrogates for the function of Bcl-2 family proteins. One sample was eliminated from statistical analysis due to insufficient number of viable cells thus yielding 25 specimens with analyzable data. All specimens were analyzed in triplicate, with coefficients of variation (CV) for repeat samples from individual patients generally <5%. The percent priming, i.e. quantifiable propensity of a given BH3 peptide to induce mitochondrial depolarization relative to an uncoupling control agent, for each peptide is summarized in Table 6 separately for patients who responded to study therapy (i.e. achieved partial response) and those who did not respond to treatment (stable disease/progressive disease). Among the peptides assayed, Puma(10) alone elicited a priming trend between responders (32.8 +- 16.5% [mean+-SD]) and non-responders (22.3 +- 9.9%; p= .059); the percent priming with Puma(10) for individual patients is depicted in Figure 2. To test the ability of Puma to serve as a predictive biomarker, we employed the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker, which yielded an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.53-0.94; p=0.027; Figure 2). ',\n"," 'In assessment of patient clinical information (Table 6,) bulky disease of >5 cm trended with patient response (Mann-Whitney p-value =0.088; AUC=0.68 (95% CI: 0.53-0.84), AUC p-value=0.022). We performed adjusted analyses of Puma priming in which we accounted for bulky disease >5 cm as a second covariate. As shown in Figure 2, adjustment for bulky disease (>5 cm) improved the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.99). The AUC p-value =0.0063 was significant for Puma combined with bulky disease (p-value <0.01; p<0.05/5 BH3 profiling biomarkers with Bonferroni correction for multiple analyses). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined flavopiridol and lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory CLL with the hypothesis that higher doses of lenalidomide would be tolerated with less tumor flare observed in patients who received flavopiridol for disease reduction prior to the initiation of lenalidomide. In this Phase I dose-escalation study of combined flavopiridol and lenalidomide in relapsed CLL, the MTD was not reached with the highest dose being given at dose level 6 with treatment of flavopiridol given in cycle 1 at a dose of 30 mg/m2 IVB + 30 mg/m2 CIVI day 1 of cycle 1 and 30 mg/m2 IVB + 50 mg/m2 CIVI day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 3, 10 and 17 of cycles 2-8 immediately after lenalidomide dosing and lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily days 1-21 of cycles 2-8. There was no unexpected toxicity seen, including no increased risk of TLS, tumor flare, or opportunistic infection. Significant clinical activity was demonstrated, with a 51% response rate in this group of relapsed, heavily pretreated patients. The response rate was not affected by the presence of high-risk genomic features, with a 50% response rate in patients with del(17p13.1) and a 71% response rate in patients with del(11q22.3). Additionally, seven patients (18%) were able to proceed with allogeneic stem cell transplant, a potentially curative therapy in these poor-risk patients. Three patients remained without evidence of disease at 3 years post-transplant. Ten (26%) of patients did experience grade 3-4 TLS, all occurring in cycle 1 of therapy with 3 of these patients being replaced. This was a slightly lower rate of TLS compared to previous studies. Furthermore, unlike those previous studies, which revealed higher rates of TLS in female CLL patients, TLS in this study appeared evenly distributed between males (7/26, 27%) and females (3/13, 23%). ',\n"," 'Furthermore, unlike previous studies that revealed significant associations between TLS and flavopiridol glucuronide exposures, we found no such associations in this study. Only one patient (3%) experienced grade 3 tumor flare and was unable to continue with lenalidomide therapy due to symptoms, despite being able to reach a dose of 15 mg orally of lenalidomide in Cycles 2-8. In prior studies using single agent lenalidomide at doses of 10-25 mg daily in relapsed CLL, 30-60% of patients experienced tumor flare. Two separate phase I studies had to modify the planned study to reduce the dose of lenalidomide from 10-15 mg daily initial dose down to a dose of 2.5 mg daily due to serious tumor flare. It may be possible to further increase lenalidomide dosing in these patients that have received cytoreduction prior to lenalidomide initiation. Biomarker testing yielded interesting results for association of mitochondrial priming (BH3 profiling) of the BH3 only peptide Puma with response. A pro-apoptotic modulator of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Puma functions as a general sensitizer. As such, Puma may not be used to specifically address whether a malignancy is driven by specific anti-apoptotic BH3 proteins, but rather it displays a global propensity of cells to respond to intrinsic pro-apoptotic cues. Previous BH3 profiling studies established that flavopiridol response in CLL patients was Bcl-xL dependent. It is perhaps not surprising that a more complex combination treatment comprising therapies with different mechanisms would be associated with a BH3 peptide that modulates multiple anti-apoptotic proteins. Further, while we would classify this as a trend between Puma profiling and response (Mann-Whitney p = 0.059; AUC p=0.027) the observation is interesting when placed in the context of the dose escalation component of the study design. Further, Puma priming when combined with bulky disease as a clinical adjustment variable displayed significant association with response (p=0.0063) indicating that additional observation may be warranted in follow-on CLL clinical studies with uniformly defined treatment regimens comprising lenalidomide and flavopiridol. In summary, this phase I dose escalation study demonstrates that the combination of flavopiridol and oral lenalidominde is feasible and well tolerated in heavily pretreated CLL patients. By treating patients with flavopiridol prior to lenalidomide therapy to decrease tumor burden, patients were able to tolerate higher doses of lenalidomide and only one patient experienced tumor flare. ',\n"," 'We evaluated the safety and biologic activity of the BH3 mimetic protein, navitoclax, combined with rituximab, in comparison to rituximab alone. One hundred and eighteen patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were randomized to receive eight weekly doses of rituximab (arm A), eight weekly doses of rituximab plus daily navitoclax for 12 weeks (arm B) or eight weekly doses of rituximab plus daily navitoclax until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (arm C). Investigator-assessed overall response rates (complete [CR] and partial [PR]) were 35% (arm A), 55% (arm B, p = 0.19 vs. A) and 70% (arm C, p = 0.0034 vs. A). Patients with del(17p) or high levels of BCL2 had significantly better clinical responses when treated with navitoclax. Navitoclax in combination with rituximab was well tolerated as initial therapy for patients with CLL, yielded higher response rates than rituximab alone and resulted in prolonged progression-free survival with treatment beyond 12 weeks. Apoptosis is an interplay between pro-survival proteins and pro-apoptosis proteins in the BCL2 family of proteins. The overexpression of BCL2 anti-apoptotic proteins sequesters pro-apoptotic proteins of the same family, leading to enhanced cell survival. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, thereby enhancing the capacity of CLL cells to resist spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. BH3 mimetics are a class of drugs designed to compete for the BH3-binding pocket in pro-survival proteins to displace sequestered pro-apoptosis proteins. ABT-737 is a small molecule inhibitor that mimics the BH3 protein, BAD, by binding to BCL2, BCLXL or BCLW, and thereby antagonizing their capacity to sequester pro-apoptosis proteins. CLL is responsive to ABT-737, and a mechanistic dissection points specifically to its ability to displace BIM from BCL2 where it is constitutively sequestered. ABT-737 has been developed into a second-generation, orally available therapeutic agent, ABT-263 (navitoclax), with similar binding properties. In addition to expressing high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, CLL cells also express high levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, making CLL cells particularly sensitive to inhibition of BCL2 by navitoclax. Navitoclax can enhance the anti-leukemia activity of rituximab, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in vitro. CLL cells that express high levels of BCL2, or that have a high ratio of BCL2 to MCL1 or other BCL2 family members, appear most sensitive to navitoclax or ABT-737. ',\n"," 'In a phase 1 study, patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who were treated with navitoclax had a 35% overall response rate (ORR). Study-emergent thrombocytopenia was managed through the implementation of a lead-in period, and neutropenia was reversible with dose reduction or administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Based on the single-agent data, the present study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biologic activity of navitoclax and rituximab versus rituximab alone, in the initial therapy of patients with CLL. An open-label phase 2, randomized three-arm, multicenter trial was performed in patients with CLL (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01087151). Patients provided written informed consent, and protocol approvals were obtained from national health authorities and independent ethics committees for each site. The study was conducted at 47 sites in nine countries in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria as the time from study entry until objective disease progression or death. Patients aged >= 18 years were eligible if they had previously untreated CLL that required treatment according to iwCLL criteria; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 due to CLL; and adequate marrow, renal and hepatic function (baseline platelet counts > 75 000/mm to allow for drug-related thrombocytopenia, hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count >= 1000/muL, serum creatinine <= 2.0 mg/dL or measured clearance >= 50 mL/min, alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase/alkaline phosphatase [ALT/AST/ALP] <=3.0 times the upper limit of normal [ULN], bilirubin <=1.5 x ULN unless Gilbert syndrome present, activated partial thromboplastin time/prothrombin time <=1.2 x ULN). Exclusion criteria included receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin), drugs that affect platelet function (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel), active infection or chronic viral infection (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]). Patients were stratified by Binet stage and high-risk cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion). Patients self-administered ABT-263 in liquid or tablet form, on a daily basis. Rituximab infusion occurred on a weekly basis in the infusion room of each participating site. ',\n"," '1 week [week 1], then 250 mg daily x 12 weeks) and arm C (rituximab 375 mg/m2 week 1, 500 mg/m2 each week 2-8, plus navitoclax 100 mg daily x 1 week [week 1], then 250 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). The rituximab dose chosen for investigation (500 mg/m2 subsequent to an initial dose of 375 mg/m2) is similar to that used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosph-amide, which resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patient outcomes. Patients randomized to ABT-263 arms B and C received the \"lead-in\" dose of 100 mg/day ABT-263 identified in the phase 1 study, followed by the final dose of 250 mg/day. The lead-in dose period lasted 8-15 days and was intended to allow for monitoring of the effects of low-dose ABT-263 on the platelet counts of treated patients. Patients enrolled in arm A who experienced disease progression at least 2 months after the last rituximab infusion were eligible for cross-over to arm B (rituximab for 8 weeks plus navitoclax daily for 12 weeks). Due to the mechanistic and early effect of navitoclax on platelet counts, it was not practical to treat patients enrolled in the rituximab-only arm with a placebo in blinded fashion. Patients on arm C who were responding to navitoclax were given the option to continue on a roll-over protocol for continued navitoclax treatment once they discontinued from the study. The ABT-263 was continued until disease progression or for 1 year, whichever came first. No further efficacy outcomes were collected on these patients. Safety was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) (version 4.0) for the standardized classification of adverse events (AEs) of drugs used in cancer therapy. Special emphasis was focused on grade >= 3 AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and grade >= 3 laboratory toxicities, and relationship to study treatment. An Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) conducted a formal safety data review from the first 30 patients treated on the combination arms B and C before additional enrollment was allowed. Thereafter, safety review meetings by the IMC were required approximately every 6 months. Navitoclax and rituximab pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were obtained at multiple visits throughout the study. ',\n"," 'Navitoclax plasma PK samples were obtained coincident with the week 1, lead-in day 5 dose: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-dose; and on week 8, day 1: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-dose in arm B and arm C. Pre-infusion and post-infusion rituximab samples were obtained on day 1 at weeks 2, 4 and 8, and rituximab concentrations were subsequently followed at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24. Navitoclax concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method. Rituximab concentrations in serum were analyzed using a validated immunoassay. Baseline bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) were collected by optional consent from patients randomly assigned to one of the three arms of this study. Protein expression of BCL2 and related family proteins were measured by intracellular staining after gating on CD19/CD5 positive CLL cells in a flow assisted cell sorting assay on fresh samples run at a central laboratory (Esoterix, Inc.) (LabCorp Clinical Trials, Cranford, NJ) within 72 h of sample collection. The following analytes were evaluated in BMAs by flow cytometry for statistical analysis: BCL2, BCLXL, MCL1, A1, BIM and NOXA, and the ratios of BCL2/MCL1 and BCLXL/MCL1. BMAs were also examined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD), relapse or death on study from any cause within 12 weeks of last tumor assessment. The study investigators assessed for clinical response using the updated iwCLL criteria. Response was assessed at week 12, and every 12 weeks during follow-up. This trial was designed to estimate the magnitude of treatment effect rather than for formal hypothesis testing. The study was originally planned to enroll 120 patients to observe approximately 72 investigator-assessed PFS events across the three treatment arms combined. Due to early discontinuation of the trial, the final study data for analysis included only 27 patients who had experienced a PFS event instead of the planned 72 patients. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm. Objective response, defined as a complete or partial response according to the modified iwCLL criteria, was estimated, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each treatment arm. ',\n"," 'The difference in objective response rate between the treatment arms was also calculated along with the 95% confidence intervals. p-Values for treatment group comparison were based on chi2 tests. Due to the explorative nature of the study, no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. Biomarker subgroups were derived by the median value of expression for each biomarker. Biomarker analysis was intended to evaluate the correlation between BCL2 levels with efficacy outcomes. Since biomarker data were available for only a small subset of patients, arms B and C were pooled to provide a larger number of patients receiving combination treatment for comparison with rituximab alone. Odds ratios of an objective response were calculated between treatment arms (arm A vs. arm B and arm C combined) for biomarker low and high groups. Logistic regression was used for each biomarker and expression subgroup. Baseline characteristics were compared between treatment arms. The sponsor provided study drug and collaborated with investigators on study design, collection, analysis and interpretation of data, writing the report and the decision to submit the paper for publication. The corresponding author had full access to all the data. This study enrolled a total of 118 patients (Figure 1), who had (Table I) a median baseline lymphocyte count of 53 000/mm3 (range 7000-552 000/mm3), median age of 63 years and 55% Binet stage B + C disease. Baseline characteristics and prognostic factors of patients randomly assigned to each arm were generally balanced between each of the treatment groups. FISH analyses of pretreatment samples revealed that 31% or 28% of patients had CLL cells with deletions in 11q or 17p, respectively. While neither safety nor toxicity was an issue, the study ended prematurely, as the sponsor decided instead to develop a more selective BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, which appeared less likely than navitoclax to induce thrombocytopenia, but that still could selectively dissociate BCL2/BIM heterodimers. All patients had either completed their treatment period or were allowed to continue on navitoclax at the time the trial was closed. Only the follow-up was discontinued early, but not the treatment. It is noteworthy that given the small sample size, this trial is hypothesis-generating and is able to detect only a large benefit of combination therapy with rituximab and ABT-263. It does not have adequate power to detect minimal clinically meaningful differences between the combination treatment arms and arm A. ',\n"," 'Thus, formal hypothesis testing is limited in that statistically negative outcomes do not necessarily rule out clinically significant effects. Ninety-one patients (77%) completed the navitoclax study; four patients crossed over to arm B from arm A. The median time on study was 34 weeks; arm A: 24 weeks (range 12-83 weeks); arm B: 33 weeks (1-105 weeks); and arm C: 44 weeks (2-86 weeks). More patients withdrew from study due to AEs in arm C (8 [20%]) than in arm A (0 [0%]) or arm B (4 [11%]). Patients in arm C, who were randomized to continue daily navitoclax after completing six cycles of rituximab, had a longer time on study (median of 44 weeks) than patients in either arm B (33 weeks) or arm A (24 weeks), because this study arm stayed open longer than the other two study arms to allow for continued administration of navitoclax. The percentages of patients who experienced grade >= 3 AEs was greater in arms B and C than in arm A. Grade >= 3 AEs (with an incidence of 5% or greater, Table II) included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain), chills, fatigue, ALT/AST/bilirubin elevations and infusion-related reactions to rituximab. Two patients had grade 5 AEs, one each (3%) in arms A and B, neither of which was assessed by the investigator as being related to treatment with navitoclax. The incidence of SAEs was not increased in patients treated with navitoclax compared to patients treated with rituximab alone. One patient had grade 3 bleeding (epistaxis). A total of 12 patients discontinued navitoclax due to an AE, four (11%) in arm B and eight (20%) in arm C. AEs leading to discontinuation of therapy with navitoclax included elevations in AST and/or ALT (six patients), pain (n = 1), hyperbilirubinemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 1), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), serum sickness (n = 1) or reaction to the infusion of rituximab (n = 1). While liver function test (LFT) abnormalities usually responded to dose adjustments, of the six patients who discontinued navitoclax, four patients in arm B discontinued at study days 37, 43, 56 and 58, while two patients on arm C discontinued at day 170 and day 316, respectively. Most of the LFT-associated discontinuations (four of the six) occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. ',\n"," 'Other reasons for discontinuation of therapy were less common: physician decision (n = 5 [4%]), sponsor decision (n = 2 [2%]) and subject/guardian decision (n = 6 [5%]). Grade >= 3 infusion-related reactions were uncommon, but more often were observed in patients treated in arm B (n = 3 [8%]) or C (n = 2 [5%]), one of which was an SAE; no patient in arm A had such an AE. Two patients died while on study, one in arm A, who died on day 163 with a pulmonary embolism, judged by the treating physician as being unrelated to rituximab treatment. One patient in arm B died on day 8 due to hypotension, which was viewed by the site investigator as being related to the infusion of rituximab. Plasma concentrations of navitoclax are shown in Table III. The maximum navitoclax concentrations (Cmax) were observed approximately 6 h after oral administration. The Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of navitoclax in this study were similar to those observed in patients treated with single-agent navitoclax in prior phase 1 studies, indicating that co-treatment with rituximab does not alter the PK of navitoclax. Patients treated in arm A had serum concentrations of rituximab that were comparable to those measured in patients treated in arm B or arm C, indicating that navitoclax does not affect the PK of rituximab. Rituximab levels were consistent across the three arms at other sampling visits from week 2 to week 24 as well (Supplemental Table I, Supplemental Figure 1 to be found online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2015.1030638). The rituximab concentration levels achieved in this study using weekly dosing were higher than those observed in patients with CLL treated with rituximab given once every 28 days. Achievement of clinical response correlated significantly with BCL2 levels (interaction effect p = 0.048), but did not correlate with levels of other BCL2 family members tested. Patients with CLL cells that had high-level expression of BCL2 protein had significantly higher odds of achieving a favorable clinical response when treated with navitoclax and rituximab, than when treated with rituximab alone (Table IV). In comparison, patients with low BCL2 had similar odds of achieving a favorable response when treated with navitoclax and rituximab as when treated with rituximab alone. ',\n"," 'The data on patients treated with navitoclax in arms B and C were combined for this analysis and compared to the data on patients treated with rituximab alone (arm A). This was done to help identify biomarkers that correlated with a favorable outcome to treatment with navitoclax and rituximab versus treatment with rituximab alone. Similar effects were also observed when comparing arms A vs. B and also arms A vs. C (data not shown). The ORR for patients treated in arm C was 70% (Table V). This compared favorably to the ORR of patients treated in arm B (55%) and was significantly greater than the ORR of patients treated in arm A (35%; p = 0034). Two patients in arm C (5%) achieved a complete response (n = 2, 5%), which was not observed for patients in other treatment arms. Twenty-seven PFS events had occurred at the time of study closure (38% of 72 events planned). These events included one patient who died (arm A), 24 patients who had stable disease or objective response (11 patients in arm A, 10 in arm B and three in arm C) and two patients (arm A) who had stable disease or objective response but subsequently went on to have progressive disease. PFS was significantly longer for arm C than for arm B or arm A (Figure 2). Arm B trended toward longer PFS than arm A. Response duration and median PFS cannot be quantified precisely due to the limited follow-up and patient numbers. Four patients crossed over from arm A to arm B. No exploratory analyses of efficacy data were performed on the cross-over period for these four patients. However, one patient had a partial response while on arm A while three patients had stable disease while on arm A and subsequently had progressive disease. Patients treated with navitoclax in combination with rituximab achieved higher ORR than patients treated with rituximab alone as initial therapy for CLL. The improved treatment outcome with navitoclax was also evident for patients who had CLL with del(17p). Similarly, improvement in treatment outcomes with navitoclax was seen in patients with CLL with other prognostic features such as del(11q) or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IgVH) (data not shown). Disease progression after therapy was observed earliest in patients treated with rituximab alone (arm A). Patients in arm C appeared to have the longest PFS. ',\n"," 'Treatment with navitoclax and rituximab was well tolerated. First, we did not observe any interactions between navitoclax and rituximab that altered the PK of either drug. Second, there were few grade >= 3 AEs that were observed more frequently in patients treated with both agents than in those treated with rituximab alone. Those AEs noted more frequently by patients treated with navitoclax included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and elevations in hepatic transaminases. Navitoclax-related thrombocytopenia is caused by shortened platelet survival due to inhibition of BCLXL, a protein necessary for normal platelet survival. This was managed by initiating therapy with a lead-in dose of 100 mg navitoclax 1 week before advancing to the 250 mg daily dose, to allow time for the marrow to increase platelet production and provide a steady-state platelet count sufficient for hemostasis. Thereafter, platelet counts were closely monitored and treatment was temporarily held or given at a reduced dose if the counts dropped. Patients also were cautioned not to use aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs while on treatment. This management appears to have mitigated risk, as the only report of bleeding among the navitoclax-treated patients was a single AE of self-limited epistaxis. Neutropenia, another mechanistic-based effect of navitoclax, was managed with dose reductions, temporary discontinuation and administration of granulocyte stimulating factor. There was no increase in infections or febrile neutropenia compared with treatment with rituximab alone. These on-target AEs and the liver function abnormalities were manageable in most cases with dose adjustments, use of granulocyte stimulating growth factor or temporary discontinuation. Nonetheless, cytopenias (one each of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) and transaminase elevations (six patients) led to the discontinuation of navitoclax in a minority of patients. Two additional patients discontinued navitoclax due to hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic transaminase elevations, respectively. Earlier studies hypothesized that the high expression of BCL2 and BIM and their association in pre-existing complexes in CLL cells would make these cells particularly sensitive to navitoclax. We found BCL2 to be well expressed in patients on this study. We further tested whether quantitative levels of BCL2, BIM and related family members would be associated with improved responses to the combination of navitoclax and rituximab. Patients with CLL cells that expressed high levels of BCL2 (above the median) appeared to have had a more favorable response to therapy with navitoclax and rituximab than with rituximab alone. ',\n"," \"These data suggest that the benefit from the addition of navitoclax to rituximab is associated with high-level CLL-cell expression of BCL2 protein. It further supports the use of baseline BCL2 protein expression as a predictive biomarker of response to navitoclax. A similar relationship was not identified for the pretreatment levels of BCLXL or MCL1, making it appear sufficient to use a more selective BCL2 antagonist. In contrast to the findings here, no significant correlation between level of expression of BCL2 and response was observed in the phase 1 study of navitoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL. This could be explained by potential biological differences between the relapsed/refractory and frontline patient population. It is also worth noting that the use of a standardized assay that was run real-time in a central laboratory on fresh patient samples may have improved quantification of protein biomarkers in the present study. However, the magnitude of the benefit from navitoclax treatment versus rituximab alone in patients with high BCL2 protein levels would need to be confirmed prospectively. The caveat to the results is the small sample size in this study, and that the analysis is exploratory. To compensate for the limited availability of data, arms B and C were pooled for the biomarker analysis where time/duration was different in arms B and C, but was not a parameter that influenced bio-marker data outcome. It must be noted that data for arms B and C were not pooled when analyzing PFS, for the PFS out-come is dependent on time/duration, which were different in the three arms. Patients treated with navitoclax and rituximab in either arm C or arm B had a significantly higher response rate than did patients treated with rituximab alone on arm A. Patients treated in arm C, who continued treatment with navitoclax, appeared to have a longer PFS than patients treated in the other study arms. Although these differences were statistically significant, caution should be exercised in interpreting these data in view of the limited follow-up period due to the study's premature discontinuation. In any case, the results of this study indicate that a high-affinity BCL2 inhibitor combined with rituximab can potentially result in high ORRs in the frontline therapy of patients with CLL, and that a combination with monoclonal antibodies may further increase the response rate. \",\n"," 'Of note, the observed response rate of patients with del(17p) was similar to that of patients without this adverse prognostic marker; in arm C, 60% of patients with del(17p) CLL had either a complete or partial response, while in the ITT population 70% of patients showed an overall response. Overall, the regimen of navitoclax and rituximab was well tolerated, with the principal toxicities being dose-related thrombocytopenia, presumably due to inhibition of BCLXL, and transient elevations in hepatic transaminases. Preliminary results indicate that a BH3-mimetic inhibitor of BCL2 could be highly effective when used in combination with rituximab for treatment of patients with CLL. Although the combination of ABT-263 and rituximab was deemed tolerable and offered a high response rate, the thrombocytopenia caused by BCLXL inhibition limited increases to optimize drug levels and complicated combinations with other drugs. At the same time, a highly selective BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, had been developed with very high affinity for BCL2 and effectively no BCLXL inhibition. This study provided additional data supporting the concept of BCL2 inhibition as an effective treatment approach for CLL and demonstrated that an increased response may be possible with a monoclonal antibody combination. ',\n"," 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily affects older persons who often have coexisting conditions in addition to disease-related immunosuppression and myelosuppression. We conducted an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial to compare two oral agents, ibrutinib and chlorambucil, in previously untreated older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. We randomly assigned 269 previously untreated patients who were 65 years of age or older and had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive ibrutinib or chlorambucil. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review committee. The median age of the patients was 73 years. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than did chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months), with a risk of progression or death that was 84% lower with ibrutinib than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; P<0.001). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival; the estimated survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death that was 84% lower in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (hazard ratio, 0.16; P=0.001). The overall response rate was higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%, P<0.001). The rates of sustained increases from baseline values in the hemoglobin and platelet levels were higher with ibrutinib. Adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea; adverse events occurring in at least 20% of those receiving chlorambucil included nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting. In the ibrutinib group, four patients had a grade 3 hemorrhage and one had a grade 4 hemorrhage. A total of 87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group are continuing to take ibrutinib. Ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as assessed by progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; RESONATE-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01722487.) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia among adults in Western countries; it affects primarily older persons, with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years. Chlorambucil has been a standard first-line therapy in CLL, especially for older patients or those with coexisting conditions. Until recently, no treatment was clearly superior to chlorambucil in this population. ',\n"," \"Fludarabine or bendamustine has been associated with higher response rates and longer progression-free survival than those with chlorambucil, but both have also been associated with higher rates of toxic effects, and neither has provided overall survival benefit. In previously untreated patients who were younger than 75 years of age, bendamustine was associated with longer progression-free survival as compared with chlorambucil (median, 21.6 months vs. 8.3 months). Only recently have data from randomized studies shown improved outcomes with the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies to chlorambucil. In the three-group randomized CLL11 study conducted by the German CLL Study Group, which involved previously untreated patients with coexisting conditions, the median progression-free survival was 29.9 months with the combination of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil, 16.3 months with the combination of rituximab and chlorambucil, and 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; overall survival was longer with the combination regimens than with chlorambucil. In another phase 3 study, which involved previously untreated patients who were not considered to be candidates for fludarabine-containing therapy, the median progression-free survival was 13.1 months with chlorambucil versus 22.4 months with the combination of chlorambucil and ofatumumab. Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is standard in younger patients with CLL, but because of treatment-related toxic effects, this regimen is not suitable for older patients or those with coexisting conditions. Patients who are 65 years of age or older do not have the same efficacy benefit, and they have more toxic effects than do younger patients treated with this combination chemoimmunotherapy. Moreover, although the median progression-free survival with first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is approximately 52 months, patients with high-risk genetic abnormalities (chromosome 17p13.1 or 11q22.3 deletion) or unmutated IGHV have inferior outcomes, with approximately 35 to 50% of the patients having progressive disease within 3 years. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that has been approved for the treatment of patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy and as primary therapy for patients with CLL who have chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. BTK is essential for signaling by means of the B-cell receptor and chemokine receptors, which CLL cells use for survival, proliferation, and tissue homing. In pharmacodynamic studies of ibrutinib in vivo in patients with CLL, ibrutinib inhibited leukemia-cell proliferation and accelerated CLL cell death. \",\n"," 'for signaling by means of the B-cell receptor and chemokine receptors, which CLL cells use for survival, proliferation, and tissue homing. In pharmacodynamic studies of ibrutinib in vivo in patients with CLL, ibrutinib inhibited leukemia-cell proliferation and accelerated CLL cell death. In the phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE) involving patients with previously treated CLL, single-agent ibrutinib showed superior efficacy to ofatumumab, with a risk of progression that was 78% lower and a risk of death that was 57% lower. In early-phase data from 31 previously untreated patients with CLL who were 65 years of age or older, the overall response rate with ibrutinib was 84% (with a complete response in 23% of the patients); the estimated rate of progression-free survival at 30 months was 96%, and the overall survival rate was 97%, with 81% of the patients continuing to take daily ibrutinib after 3 years of follow-up. These findings suggest a role for single-agent ibrutinib as initial treatment in patients with CLL. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial (RESONATE-2; study number, PCYC-1115-CA) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil in patients 65 years of age or older with previously untreated CLL. Eligible patients were 65 years of age or older and had previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma requiring therapy. Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 2 or less (on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher numbers indicating increasing disability), an absolute neutrophil count of 1000 cells or more per cubic millimeter, a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter, and adequate liver and kidney function. Patients were ineligible if they had chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. All the patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each institution and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was sponsored and designed by Pharmacyclics. All the investigators and their research teams collected the data. The sponsor confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled the data for analysis. All the authors had full access to the data and were involved in the interpretation of the data. ',\n"," \"The first draft of the manuscript was collaboratively written by the first and last authors and two authors who are employees of the sponsor. Editorial support was provided by a professional medical writer, with funding from the sponsor. All the authors contributed to the revisions and final approval of the manuscript and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and analyses and confirm adherence of the trial to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). An independent review committee whose members were unaware of the treatment assignments and lymphocyte counts evaluated response and progression. Patients were enrolled in the United States, countries in Europe, and other countries (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either oral ibrutinib (at a dose of 420 mg once daily) until disease progression or development of an unacceptable level of toxic effects or up to 12 cycles of chlorambucil (at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle, which was increased to a maximum of 0.8 mg per kilogram, if there was not an unacceptable level of toxic effects) until disease progression, determination of a lack of efficacy (defined as a lack of complete or partial response, as determined by the investigator), or development of an unacceptable level of toxic effects. Patients with disease progression that was confirmed by the independent review committee were enrolled in a separate extension study (PCYC-1116-CA) for follow-up and second-line treatment according to the investigator's choice. Treatment in the PCYC-1116-CA study could include ibrutinib for chlorambucil-treated patients who had disease that progressed according to the independent review committee and who had an indication for treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) as determined by the investigator. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the independent review committee according to the iwCLL criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis such that isolated treatment-related lymphocytosis (in the absence of other clinical, computed tomographic, or laboratory evidence of disease progression) was not considered to indicate progressive disease. \",\n"," 'Key secondary end points included overall survival, overall response (details in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), the rate of sustained improvement in hematologic variables, and safety. Sustained hematologic improvement was defined as an increase in hematologic variables that was sustained continuously for at least 56 days without transfusion or growth factors, as measured by the following: an increase in the platelet count or absolute neutrophil count from baseline of at least 50%, or for hemoglobin, an increase from baseline of >=2 g per deciliter; or for patients with baseline cytopenia, an increase to a hemoglobin level of more than 11 g per deciliter, a platelet count of more than 100,000 per cubic millimeter, or an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1500 per cubic millimeter. Safety assessments included evaluation of adverse events and measurement of laboratory variables. The severity of nonhematologic adverse events was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Hematologic adverse events were graded according to the iwCLL criteria. Patients were monitored every 2 weeks during cycles 1 and 2, every 4 weeks during cycles 3 through 12, and then every 8 weeks starting at cycle 13. The assessment of response was conducted every 4 cycles until disease progression or until study closure. The study was powered on the basis of the primary end point, progression-free survival. We calculated that the occurrence of 81 events of death or disease progression would provide the study with approximately 85% power to detect a hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.50 with ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil, with the use of a one-sided log-rank test at an alpha level of 0.025. No interim analysis was planned. The type I error was controlled with the use of a hierarchical closed-testing procedure for the primary end point and ordered secondary end points including, in order, overall response rate, overall survival, and sustained hematologic improvement. The primary analysis was a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to two randomization factors: ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. 2) and disease stage (Rai stage <=II vs. III or IV). The overall response rate was analyzed by means of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, stratified according to the two randomization factors. Overall survival was analyzed with the use of an unstratified log-rank test, owing to small event numbers. ',\n"," \"The rate of sustained hematologic improvement was compared by a chi-square test for treatment effect. Beginning in March 2013, a total of 269 patients underwent randomization (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The characteristics of the patients at baseline were well balanced between the two groups (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 73 years, with 70% of the patients being 70 years of age or older; 45% of the patients had advanced-stage disease (Rai stage III or IV), and 20% had chromosome 11q22.3 deletion. The median follow-up was 18.4 months, with 87% of the patients who had been randomly assigned to ibrutinib still receiving treatment at the time of analysis. In the chlorambucil group, 40% of the patients completed the maximum of 12 cycles of treatment (mean dose per administration, 0.6 mg per kilogram; range, 0.3 to 0.8). Ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than that with chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months) as assessed by the independent review committee, with a relative risk of progression or death that was 84% lower than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.28; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). The rate of progression-free survival at 18 months was 90% in the ibrutinib group versus 52% in the chlorambucil group. The results of the analysis of progression-free survival were consistent in the higher-risk subgroups, including patients with Rai stage III or IV disease, worse ECOG performance-status score, presence of chromosome 11q22.3 deletion, and unmutated IGHV status (Fig. 1C). The rate of progression-free survival at 18 months with ibrutinib was approximately 89% both in the subgroup with unmutated IGHV and in the subgroup with mutated IGHV; the corresponding rates of progression-free survival with chlorambucil were 47% and 51%. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival, a key sensitivity analysis, also showed significant prolongation of progression-free survival with ibrutinib (median, not reached vs. 15.0 months), with a relative risk of progression or death that was 91% lower than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.17; P<0.001) (Fig. 1B). The only case of Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into an aggressive, rapidly growing large-cell lymphoma) occurred in the chlorambucil group. Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival (median, not reached in either group). \",\n"," 'The overall survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death with ibrutinib that was 84% lower than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56; P = 0.001) (Fig. 2A). Over the median follow-up of 18.4 months, 3 patients in the ibrutinib group died, as compared with 17 in the chlorambucil group. The 3 patients in the ibrutinib group who died included 1 who died from a klebsiella infection and 2 who died from unknown causes (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the 17 patients in the chlorambucil group who died, the most common causes were progressive disease and infection. None of the patients in the ibrutinib group who had disease that progressed died during follow-up. The response rate as assessed by the independent review committee was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (86% vs. 35%) (Fig. 2B); 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Details regarding the frequency and duration of lymphocytosis with ibrutinib are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. Complete responses (including those in patients with incomplete blood-count recovery) occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 2% of those in the chlorambucil group (Fig. 2B). The rates of sustained improvement in hemato-logic variables were significantly higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix). Among patients with anemia at baseline, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group had sustained improvement in the hemoglobin level (84% vs. 45%, P<0.001) (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, among patients who had thrombocytopenia at baseline, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group had sustained improvement in the platelet count (77% vs. 43%, P = 0.005). Changes in hematologic variables over time are shown in Figure 3. The most common adverse events, defined as those that occurred in 15% or more of the patients in either treatment group, are shown in Table 2 and in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix. ',\n"," 'The median period of exposure to the study treatment was 17.4 months (range, 0.7 to 24.7) in the ibrutinib group versus 7.1 months (range, 0.5 to 11.7) in the chlorambucil group, hence the corresponding collection period for adverse-event data was longer in the ibrutinib group. In the ibrutinib group, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event (in 42% of the patients, including grade 3 diarrhea in 4%) (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Other adverse events that occurred in 20% or more of the patients in the ibrutinib group were fatigue, nausea, and cough. In the chlorambucil group, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting were observed in 20% or more of the patients; all these events occurred at a higher frequency in the chlorambucil group than in the ibrutinib group (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Discontinuation of treatment owing to adverse events occurred less frequently in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (in 9% vs. 23% of the patients). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events are listed in Table 2. Hypertension was observed in 14% of the patients in the ibrutinib group, with grade 3 hypertension occurring in 4% and no events of grade 4 or 5. All six patients with grade 3 hypertension were treated with antihypertensive medication and did not require a dose reduction or discontinuation of ibrutinib. Four of these patients had a history of hypertension; blood-pressure values over time in these patients are shown in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Atrial fibrillation occurred in eight patients (6%) in the ibrutinib group, which was of grade 2 in six patients and grade 3 in two. Atrial fibrillation was managed with discontinuation of the study drug in two patients (1%) and without modification of the ibrutinib dose in the remaining six patients. Seven of these eight patients had a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or myocardial ischemia. One patient in the chlorambucil group had atrial fibrillation. During a median of 17.4 months of exposure to ibrutinib, major hemorrhage (defined as any serious or grade 3 or higher hemorrhage or central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade) occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group (six patients, with one having grade 2 hemorrhage, four having grade 3, and one having grade 4) (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). ',\n"," 'Hemorrhage led to the discontinuation of treatment in three of these patients; three of the six patients were receiving concomitant low-molecular-weight heparin, aspirin, or vitamin E at the time of the event. Major hemorrhage in the central nervous system included one grade 4 intraparenchymal hemorrhage related to transformation of an ischemic stroke in a patient with diabetes and hypertension and one grade 3 post-traumatic subdural hematoma. Major hemorrhage occurred in 2% of the patients in the chlorambucil group over the 7.1-month period of exposure. In this randomized study involving older patients with previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil with respect to progression-free and overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables. The relative risk of progression was 84% lower and the relative risk of death was also 84% lower with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil. Ibrutinib toxicity was modest in the majority of patients, with 87% of the patients continuing to take the single-agent therapy at a median follow-up of 18.4 months. All current standards for first-line CLL therapy are based on cytotoxic chemotherapy, including alkylating agents, purine analogues, or combinations thereof, except for patients with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, for whom ibrutinib is a primary consideration for first-line therapy according to consensus guidelines. In addition to their myelosuppressive effects, these cytotoxic chemotherapy approaches may be associated with expansion of subclones with high-risk genetic abnormalities (e.g., TP53 or NOTCH1 mutation) and an increased risk of secondary cancers, including treatment-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. When this study was initiated, single-agent chlorambucil was considered to be a standard first-line treatment in older patients with CLL. Phase 3 studies have only recently shown improvement in outcomes when chlorambucil is coadministered with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Depending on the anti-CD20 agent used in these combinations, the median progression-free survival has been reported as 16.3 months (with rituximab and chlorambucil), 22.4 months (with ofatumumab and chlorambucil), and 29.9 months (with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil). The addition of an anti-CD20 agent that requires a slow infusion has been associated with infusion reactions of grade 3 or higher (in 4 to 20% of patients) and with higher rates of neutropenia of grade 3 or higher (in 27 to 35%) than have been observed with chlorambucil alone. ',\n"," 'Similar to results observed in patients with relapsed disease, the finding of a positive effect of ibrutinib on progression-free survival in the current study was seen in high-risk subgroups, including patients with Rai stage III or IV disease, those with chromosome 11q22.3 deletion, and those with unmutated IGHV. At 18 months, the rate of progression-free survival with ibrutinib as assessed by the independent review committee was 90%, and the rate as assessed by the investigator was 94%; the median progression-free survival with ibrutinib could not be estimated owing to the small number of progression events. The median progression-free survival of 18.9 months with chlorambucil that was observed in this study appears to be generally longer than that reported in previous trials with chlorambucil in previously untreated patients, in which the median progression-free survival ranged from 8.3 to 20.0 months. The relatively strong performance of chlorambucil in the current study may have been influenced, in part, by a generally longer exposure to chlorambucil than was used in earlier trials involving previously untreated patients with CLL or by the exclusion of patients with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion (typically 5 to 10% of previously untreated patients with CLL). Ibrutinib substantially improved overall survival, with an overall survival rate of 98% at 24 months, a finding that is consistent with the 97% rate reported in a phase 2 study of ibrutinib with 3 years of follow-up. In these two studies, deaths (3 deaths among 136 patients and 1 death among 31 patients, respectively) were limited to the early part of follow-up with a relative plateau in the survival curve thereafter. The magnitude of the difference in overall survival with ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil (hazard ratio for death, 0.16) was greater than that observed in studies assessing the addition of anti-CD20 agents to chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.47 in one study and 0.91 in another study). Given the availability of crossover for patients who had disease that progressed during chlorambucil treatment, the prolongation of overall survival, which was a major benefit in this study, suggests that patients have benefits with first-line ibrutinib treatment possibly owing to reduced CLL-related or treatment-related mortality before the initiation of second-line therapy. These findings suggest that better results with ibrutinib might be obtained when it is used as first-line treatment rather than for later relapses or in patients with refractory disease. ',\n"," 'The response rate was significantly higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%). On the basis of results from an early-phase study, the rate of complete response is likely to increase with continued ibrutinib therapy. Furthermore, ibrutinib-treated patients had a restoration of bone marrow function, with a significantly higher rate of sustained improvement in hematologic variables. This finding has particular clinical relevance because bone marrow failure is a common cause of complications in patients with CLL, with anemia and thrombocytopenia being frequent indications for initiating treatment in this population. The safety of ibrutinib in this older population of patients with CLL who often had clinically significant coexisting conditions (Table 1) was consistent with that in previous reports. Exposure to treatment and adverse-event follow-up was nearly 2.5 times as long with ibrutinib as with chlorambucil. Similar to findings in previous reports about ibrutinib, major hemorrhage was observed in 4% of the patients, with no fatal events, and atrial fibrillation occurred in 6%, with the majority of the events (in six of eight patients) being grade 2 events that were observed over the period of 1.5 years while the patients were taking ibrutinib. Hypertension was reported more frequently with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil, with no events leading to dose modification or having a severity of grade 4 or 5. The rates of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression were higher with chlorambucil than with ibrutinib. Early discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events was more than twice as frequent with chlorambucil as with ibrutinib. In conclusion, in this older population of patients with CLL, many of whom had coexisting conditions, oral ibrutinib was administered continuously with a safety profile consistent with that in prior reports, which permitted the vast majority of patients to continue taking the treatment at the completion of the study. As compared with chlorambucil, a standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, ibrutinib was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival and with higher rates of response and improvement in hematologic variables among patients with previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

SUMMARY  AIM  The Phase Ib GERSHWIN study (NCT01680991) assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile obinutuzumab following multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses to Chinese patients with B-cell lymphomas,  and compared findings with previous obinutuzumab PK studies in mainly Caucasian (non-Chinese)  patients. METHODS  GERSHWIN was an open-label, single-arm intervention study. Patients aged >18 years with CD20+  relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or  follicular lymphoma (FL) were enrolled from four centres in China. The treatment period was 24  weeks; patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg i.v. on Days (D)1, 8 and 15 of Cycle (C)1 (CLL  patients: first infusion split over 2 days) and on D1 of C2–8 (all cycles: 21 days). PK parameters were  estimated using non-compartmental analysis (NCA), and a population PK analysis was used to  determine whether observed GERSHWIN PK data were in accordance with previous obinutuzumab PK studies in non-Chinese patients. RESULTS  The PK analysis population included 48 patients: 28 patients completed all treatment cycles. NCA  showed a similar PK profile in Chinese patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. ',\n"," 'Steady-state concentrations  of obinutuzumab appeared to be reached at the start of C2 irrespective of histology. There was no  apparent relationship between body weight and systemic exposure. Most PK profiles observed in  GERSHWIN lay within the 90% prediction interval of simulated profiles. CONCLUSIONS  Obinutuzumab exposure was comparable in CLL, DLBCL and FL patients.

Introduction  B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that range from slow- growing indolent and incurable diseases, such as follicular lymphoma (FL) or chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia (CLL), to more aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). In China, there are few  epidemiological data for lymphoma. According to a nationwide collaborative study of 10 002  lymphoma cases diagnosed in 2010, DLBCL is the most common B-cell lymphoma subtype in China,  accounting for 50.2% of all cases, compared with 8.3% for FL and 6.4% for CLL/small lymphocytic  lymphoma [1]. The relatively low incidence of CLL among the Chinese population was also  highlighted in a North American survey, which reported a world age-standardised rate (per 100 000)  for CLL of 0.40 among the Chinese population in British Columbia compared with 1.71 among the  non-Chinese population [2]. Despite the availability of various agents for the treatment of non-Hodgkin  lymphoma (NHL) and CLL, there is an on-going need for the development of safe and effective  therapies to prolong remission in patients and to improve cure rates. Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA/GAZYVARO) is a novel glycoengineered type II monoclonal  antibody (mAb). ',\n"," 'high-affinity binding to the CD20  antigen, and high antibody-dependent cellular toxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and  cell death induction, combined with low complement-dependent cytotoxic activity [3, 4].

All rights reserved. approval has recently been granted in Europe, the USA and other countries worldwide for use of  obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil to treat previously untreated patients with CLL [5, 6]. The basis for this approval was data from the Phase III CLL11 study showing a statistically significant  improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil compared with  rituximab plus chlorambucil in treatment-naïve CLL patients (n = 781) with comorbidities (median PFS  29.2 vs. 15.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33, 0.50; P < 0.001) [7,  8]. Obinutuzumab also demonstrated promising activity in patients with rituximab-refractory CLL and  NHL in the single-arm Phase II GAUGUIN study [9, 10] and a higher overall response rate compared  with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent lymphoma in the Phase II GAUSS study [11]. Subsequently, the Phase III GADOLIN study in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL  showed that independently-assessed PFS was longer after treatment with obinutuzumab plus  bendamustine than after bendamustine alone (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.4, 0.74; P = 0.00011) [12]. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of obinutuzumab are well described by a two-compartment model comprising linear and non-linear time-varying clearance pathways [13]. date, several  studies have examined the PK of obinutuzumab in patients with NHL and CLL, for example the Phase  II GAUGUIN study (NCT00517530 [9, 10]) in Caucasian patients [9, 10, 14–16], and a Phase I  Japanese study [17]. Other studies assessing obinutuzumab PK include CLL11 (NCT01010061 [7]),  GAUDI (NCT00825149; Grigg A, et al., Haematologica, under consideration) [18, 19], GAUSS  (NCT00576758 [11]), GATHER (NCT01414855) and GADOLIN (NCT01059630 [20]). However, bridging studies are a frequent requirement of Asian drug regulatory authorities when considering a  new therapeutic entity [21]. The primary purpose of the current study (GERSHWIN; NCT01680991)  was to assess the PK profile of obinutuzumab following administration of multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses to Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B-cell lymphomas and to compare the findings with  those from other obinutuzumab PK studies in mainly Caucasian (non-Chinese) patients using a  population PK approach.

All rights reserved. four centres in China from 6 September 2012 to 15 August 2013. GERSHWIN was conducted accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. This study  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of  Medical Sciences, in May 2012 (12–047/581). All patients provided written informed consent to  participate in the study. The treatment period was 24 weeks; patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg i.v. on Days 1,  8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 8 (each cycle lasted 21 days). The first infusion of  obinutuzumab on Cycle 1 Day 1 was given as a split dose over 2 days in CLL patients. For the first  infusion, obinutuzumab was administered at an initial rate of 50 mg/h in patients with NHL. In the  absence of infusion-related reactions, the infusion rate was increased by 50 mg/h every 30 min to a  maximum of 400 mg/h. In CLL patients, the first two infusions were given at a dose of 100 mg at a  rate of 25 mg/h over 4 h on Day 1 and at a dose of 900 mg starting at 50 mg/h on Day 2, increasing  by 50 mg/h every 30 min to a maximum of 400 mg/h. If the first obinutuzumab infusion was well  tolerated by the patient (CLL or NHL), subsequent infusions were given at an initial rate of 100 mg/h  and increased by 100 mg/h increments at 30-min intervals (as tolerated) to a maximum rate of 400  mg/h. Obinutuzumab aqueous solution was supplied in a 50 ml glass vial containing 1000 mg of  drug in 40 ml of solution (25 mg/ml), together with the excipients histidine, trehalose and  poloxamer 188. Before infusion, obinutuzumab was diluted by adding 40 ml of solution to 210 ml of  0.9% sodium chloride solution in an infusion bag, to produce a final concentration for infusion of  4 mg/ml. ',\n"," 'Study population  Patients were aged >18 years with histologically documented CD20+ relapsed/refractory CLL, DLBCL  or FL, an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and a life  expectancy of >6 months. Patients with FL or DLBCL could be included if they had failed (relapsing  after, or refractory to) ≥1 chemotherapy regimen with or without rituximab at any point in their  treatment history.

Refractory was defined as progression on treatment or stable disease (SD), or any response that was  followed by progression <6 months after treatment. With the exception of CLL patients, all patients must have had ≥1 bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (>1.5 cm in its largest dimension by computed tomography). For CLL patients,  circulating lymphocyte count assessments were an acceptable method of measurement. All  measurable and evaluable disease was required to be assessed and documented before study  treatment initiation. Tumour response was assessed according to the International Workshop to  Standardize Response criteria for NHL [22], and the 2008 guidelines of the International Workshop on  CLL [23]. Full inclusion criteria and details of patient exclusion criteria can be found in Appendix I. Study endpoints and procedures  Blood samples for the measurement of obinutuzumab serum concentrations (5 ml pre-dose Cycle 1 Day 1; 2 ml for all other samples) were collected as follows. For NHL patients, Day 1 samples  were collected pre-dose, at the end of infusion, and at 4, 24, 72 and 120 h post-infusion. For CLL  patients, Day 1 and Day 2 samples were collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion, and also at 4,  24, 72 and 120 h post-infusion on Day 2. The additional sampling for CLL patients reflected the split  dosing of obinutuzumab over Days 1 and 2 in this group. ',\n"," 'Additional blood samples (all patients) were  collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion for all subsequent doses, and at 4, 24, 72, 120, 168,  336, 504 and 672 h and 3 and 6 months after the final infusion (Cycle 8 Day 1). Obinutuzumab serum concentrations were measured using a specific and validated enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Samples were pre-incubated with a cocktail containing  biotinylated and digoxigenin-labelled anti-idiotype antibodies directed to the antigen binding site of  obinutuzumab. Using a streptavidin-coated microplate, immune complexes bound to the microplate  were detected by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Fab fragments directed digoxigenin. Bound peroxidase was detected through a chromogenic reaction. The absorbance (405 nm for detection absorbance and 490 nm for reference absorbance) was proportional to the  amount of obinutuzumab present in the sample.

The lower limit  of quantification in undiluted serum was 0.00405 μg/ml. The calibration range concentrations were  0.00405 to 0.400 μg/ml in 100% human serum. The accuracy of the ELISA method (using quality  control samples) for determination of obinutuzumab serum sample concentrations was consistent  throughout the study: precision ranged from 4.43% to 25.2% and accuracy ranged from 95.1% to  100.0%. Pharmacokinetic analyses  The PK analysis population included all patients randomised and adherent to the study protocol. Pharmacokinetic analyses using non-compartmental analysis (NCA)  PK parameters of obinutuzumab for each patient were estimated using NCA (Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.2; Certara USA, Inc.). Time to maximum observed serum concentration (tmax), maximum  observed serum concentration (Cmax), and trough concentration before the next dose (Ctrough) were  obtained directly from plasma vs. time profiles. The following PK parameters were calculated:  apparent terminal half-life (t1/2), area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to Day 7  (AUC7d), area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to Day 21 (AUC21d) at Cycle 8,  systemic clearance (CLss), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss). All computed PK parameters were presented as summary statistics, including arithmetic means, geometric means (e.g. AUC and Cmax), medians, ranges, standard deviations and coefficients  of variation (CV%). Individual and mean serum concentrations of obinutuzumab vs. time were  graphically displayed. ',\n"," 'Population pharmacokinetic analysis  To determine if observed obinutuzumab PK data from GERSHWIN (available for 48 Chinese patients)  were in accordance with obinutuzumab PK data from previous clinical studies, a robust population PK  model previously developed in a large database of 961 lymphoma patients (mainly Caucasian [95%]:  342 CLL; 469 indolent NHL [406 FL]; 130 DLBCL; 20 mantle cell lymphoma]) was used to simulate  PK profiles in the GERSHWIN study (unpublished data on file, F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Clinical  Pharmacology, Basel, Switzerland). Simulations were conducted by taking into account patients’  baseline characteristics (e.g. tumour size, body weight, gender) in the current study, and were run 100  This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. times to determine the median, 5 and 95 predicted PK profile. The adequacy of matching between  observed obinutuzumab concentrations in GERSHWIN and predicted PK profiles was assessed graphically by overlaying the observed PK data with the predicted mean profile and its associated  90% prediction interval. Full details of the population PK model have been published previously by  Gibiansky et al. [13]. Results  Patients  Of 56 Chinese patients screened, 48 patients (FL, n = 13; DLBCL, n = 23; CLL, n = 12) were enrolled  and 28 patients (58.3%) completed treatment. Seventeen patients discontinued obinutuzumab during  Cycles 1–4 and three patients discontinued obinutuzumab during Cycles 5–8. Reasons for  discontinuation of obinutuzumab included progressive disease (n = 9), physician decision (n = 6),  withdrawal by patient (n = 3), adverse event (pneumonia) and protocol violation (n = 1 each). A total  of 141 adverse events were reported by 35 patients, most of which were of mild or moderate severity  (116; 82.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events were infusion-related reactions (15  patients; 31.2%), all of which occurred after the first obinutuzumab infusion. full report of safety  results from the study will be published separately. The PK analysis population included 48 patients: 28 patients (FL, n = 11; DLBCL, n = 8; CLL,  n = 9) completed the 8-cycle PK sample collection. ',\n"," 'Three patients (DLBCL, n = 2; CLL, n = 1) were  excluded from the Cycle 1 PK analysis due to limited PK sampling and an additional two patients  (DLBCL, n = 2) were excluded from the analysis of t1/2 and Vss at Cycle 8 only, because their values  could not be reliably estimated. Most patients had advanced-stage disease (Binet B or C for CLL, Ann Arbor 3–4 for FL or  DLBCL) and the median number of prior treatment lines was similar across lymphoma types (CLL,  2.0; DLBCL, 2.0; FL, 3.0) (Table 1).

The mean serum  This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. concentration-time profiles for obinutuzumab for patients from Cycle 1 to Cycle 8 are shown in  Figure 2. Derived PK parameters for all patient populations for Cycle 1 and Cycle 8 are summarised in  Table 2. Overall, comparison of Cmax and AUC21d as well as other derived PK parameters showed the  PK profile of obinutuzumab to be very similar for the three lymphoma types (Table 2). Mean serum  concentrations of obinutuzumab over Cycles 1–8 showed that Cmax and Ctrough steady-state levels  appeared to be achieved at the start of Cycle 2, irrespective of histology. Concentration–time profiles  were similar for the three lymphoma types (Figure 2), with a slight increase in serum levels of  obinutuzumab from Cycles 5/6–8 in patients with DLBCL or CLL. Systemic exposure to obinutuzumab  after the Cycle 8 dose (AUC21d value) was not dependent on body weight for any of the three  lymphoma types (Figure 3), although a slight trend for decreased AUC with increased body weight  was seen for FL patients (P = 0.286; P = 0.876 for DLBCL; P = 0.897 for CLL). Inter-subject variability  of obinutuzumab exposure appeared to be slightly higher for patients with CLL (CV% estimated to be  <43% for AUC and <33% for Cmax for both cycles) than for patients with DLBCL or FL (CV% estimated  to be <38% for AUC and <29% for Cmax for both cycles). ',\n"," 'Population pharmacokinetic analysis  Population PK analysis showed that most PK profiles from Chinese patients observed in GERSHWIN  lay within the 90% prediction interval of the simulated profiles, indicating that PK data in Chinese  patients were in agreement with the PK characteristics in non-Chinese lymphoma patients (which  were established previously using population PK methods) (Figure 4). Discussion  Non-compartmental analysis of Chinese patients in the Phase Ib GERSHWIN study showed that the  PK profile of obinutuzumab is similar in patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. Steady-state concentrations of obinutuzumab appeared to be reached at the start of Cycle 2 dosing irrespective of  histology, and there was no apparent relationship between body weight and AUC. addition,  estimated exposure at steady state (e.g. Cycle 8 AUC21d and Cmax) for Chinese patients with DLBCL  and FL was generally similar to that for Chinese patients with CLL. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. A two-compartment PK model comprising linear and non-linear time-varying clearance pathways has been shown to adequately describe serum obinutuzumab concentration data. The initial  clearance of obinutuzumab is more than two times higher than the steady-state clearance; this is  consistent with a decrease in the time-varying clearance component, which is high at the start of  treatment and then declines with administration of repeated cycles of obinutuzumab. The time-varying  clearance pathway is consistent with target-mediated drug disposition, such that at the start of  treatment, obinutuzumab is bound to a large quantity of CD20+ cells. With repeated dosing of  obinutuzumab, the pool of CD20+ cells becomes saturated, hence reducing the contribution of this  component to overall clearance. The linear clearance pathway is consistent with catabolism of  immunoglobulin G antibodies, and is therefore independent of CD20+ cells. These observations  support the need to minimise the time-varying clearance component quickly, and led to the proposed  obinutuzumab dose regimen of 1000 mg for both induction and extended treatment [13]. In addition to the non-compartmental PK analysis, a population PK assessment was performed to determine if data from GERSHWIN were in accordance with previously collected PK  data in mainly Caucasian patients for obinutuzumab. A population PK model comprising 961 patients  was used to simulate PK profiles in the current study. ',\n"," 'The results from this population PK analysis  support our main finding that observed obinutuzumab PK parameters are similar across Chinese and  non-Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL. The PK profile of obinutuzumab reported in the current study was similar to that reported in  two previous studies evaluating obinutuzumab PK in relapsed or refractory CLL and NHL patients  from Europe (GAUGUIN, Phase II) [9, 10, 14] and Japan (Phase I) [17] (Table 3). In a Phase II update  of the GAUGUIN study, 12 CLL and 47 NHL (relapsed/refractory) patients had PK data available at  Cycle 8. The NHL patients comprised 30 cases of indolent NHL (including FL) and 17 cases of  aggressive NHL (including DLBCL), and all patients were Caucasian except for one Asian patient with  CLL. The doses of obinutuzumab were 1000 mg for CLL and 400/800 mg for NHL. Notably, the  primary PK parameters for obinutuzumab at Cycle 8, i.e. geometric mean dose-adjusted Cmax, Ctrough  and AUC21d, were similar between GAUGUIN and the current study for both NHL and CLL (Cmax/dose  0.75–0.94 vs. 0.87–1.05 μg/ml/mg; Ctrough/dose 0.40–0.52 vs. 0.35–0.46 μg/ml/mg; AUC21d/dose 11.0– 14.7 vs. 11.3–13.0 day•µg/ml/mg) (Table 3). In the Phase I Japanese study, PK data were available  This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. for 10 patients with NHL across four dose cohorts at Cycle 8. Each cohort received a lower initial  obinutuzumab dose, which was then increased for the second and subsequent doses (i.e. 200/400  mg, 400/800 mg, 800/1200 mg, and 1200/2000 mg). All patients were Japanese and the majority had  FL. Despite the small sample size, the dose-adjusted PK data for obinutuzumab (Cmax/dose 0.87–1.50  μg/ml/mg; Ctrough/dose 0.36–1.05 μg/ml/mg; AUC21d/dose 9.0–14.9 day•µg/ml/mg) were comparable  with the data reported in the current study, which also had a relatively small sample size (n = 48). Notably, our finding that the PK profile of obinutuzumab is similar in Chinese vs. non-Chinese  patients is consistent with the similar PK profiles observed for other mAbs across ethnic populations. ',\n"," 'Both intrinsic (e.g. genetic and physiological differences) and extrinsic ethnic factors (e.g. cultural and  environmental differences) can impact on drug disposition, safety and efficacy; however, there is an  increasing body of evidence to suggest that ethnicity, after accounting for body weight differences,  may not influence the PK profile of biologics to the same degree that it does for small molecules [24]. Reasons for this include a lack of involvement of hepatic metabolism in the clearance and elimination  of mAbs and the fact that mAbs are administered parenterally, thereby avoiding any impact of dietary  factors on systemic exposure. This is also borne out by a recent review by Zhou et al. showing that  the dosing regimens of 12 mAbs approved in the USA and Japan are identical or very similar in both  countries [21]. In conclusion, we provide evidence that obinutuzumab exposure is comparable in Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL. Results indicate that PK characteristics in Chinese patients are  similar to those reported in non-Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, our population PK analysis confirms that the PK data observed are in agreement with  the previously established PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in non-Chinese patients with CLL,  DLBCL and FL.

Summary Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) detection is a promising monitoring tool for lymphoid malignan- cies. We evaluated whether the presence of ctDNA was associated with out- come after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in lymphoma patients. We studied 88 patients drawn from a phase 3 clinical trial of reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT in lymphoma. Conventional restaging and collection of peripheral blood samples occurred at pre-speci- fied time points before and after HSCT and were assayed for ctDNA by sequencing of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes. Tumour clonotypes were identified in 87% of patients with adequate tumour sam- ples. Sixteen of 19 (84%) patients with disease progression after HSCT had detectable ctDNA prior to progression at a median of 3 7 months prior to relapse/progression. Patients with detectable ctDNA 3 months after HSCT had inferior progression-free survival (PFS) (2-year PFS 58% vs. 84% in ctDNA-negative patients, P = 0 033). In multivariate models, detectable ctDNA was associated with increased risk of progression/death (Hazard ratio 3 9, P = 0 003) and increased risk of relapse/progression (Hazard ratio 10 8, P = 0 0006). ',\n"," 'Detectable ctDNA is associated with an increased risk of relapse/progression, but further validation studies are necessary to confirm these findings and determine the clinical utility of NGS-based min- imal residual disease monitoring in lymphoma patients after HSCT. Keywords: lymphomas, minimal residual disease, stem cell transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Relapse is a main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with lymphoma (Armand et al, 2008; Devetten et al, 2009; Bacher et al, 2012; Robinson et al, 2013; Smith et al, 2013; Fenske et al, 2014). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), which is associated with a lower risk of transplant-related mortality, has extended the availability of HSCT to older and frailer populations, but carries an increased risk of relapse (Khouri et al, 1998; Armand et al, 2008; Sorror et al, 2008; Thomson et al, 2009). Early detection of relapse after HSCT could potentially be used to guide pre-emptive intervention, but post-HSCT disease monitoring methods in patients with lymphoma are typically restricted to radiological and bone marrow studies, which have limited sensitivity to detect low volume disease (Barrington et al, 2014). Monitoring for min- imal residual disease (MRD) in a range of haematological malignancies can identify patients at high risk of relapse after standard therapy and HSCT (Radich et al, 1995; Raff et al, 2007; Zhou et al, 2007; Ritgen et al, 2008; Bottcher et al, 2011, 2012; Ferrero et al, 2011; Walter et al, 2013). research paper ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology doi: 10.1111/bjh.14311 effective MRD assay that could identify lymphoma patients at increased risk for relapse after HSCT would be a powerful tool for developing relapse prevention strategies. However, MRD monitoring techniques are not available for most lym- phoma subtypes, particularly when there is no peripheral blood involvement or characteristic chromosomal rearrange- ment (Gribben et al, 1991, 1993; Corradini et al, 2004; Man- cuso et al, 2010). Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based MRD detection using the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes (Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp., South San Francisco, CA, USA) can identify circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma (cell-free) of patients with lymphoid malignancies. ',\n"," 'detect MRD not identified by multi-para- meter flow cytometry or allele-specific oligonucleotide poly- merase chain reaction testing (Faham et al, 2012; Logan et al, 2013; Ladetto et al, 2014). The NGS-based MRD detec- tion method can identify ctDNA at diagnosis in a range of lymphomas, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), subtypes in which MRD detection has previously been challenging (Armand et al, 2013; Kurtz et al, 2015; Oki et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). In addition, ctDNA levels track with treatment response in DLBCL, and the persistence or recur- rence of ctDNA during and after upfront therapy is associ- ated with subsequent DLBCL relapse (Kurtz et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). Following HSCT for acute lym- phoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukae- mia (CLL), ctDNA is associated with subsequent relapse and poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (Logan et al, 2013, 2014). In the present pilot study, we evaluated whether ctDNA detected by the NGS-based MRD assessment method is associated with relapse and survival in patients with lym- phoma undergoing RIC HSCT. Methods We performed a retrospective study using research samples collected as part of a prospective, multi-centre, open-label, phase III randomized clinical trial evaluating the addition of sirolimus to the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophy- laxis regimen of patients with lymphoma undergoing RIC allogeneic HSCT (Armand et al, 2016a). The clinical trial and this retrospective study were approved by the Institu- tional Review Board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/ Harvard Cancer Center. Informed consent was obtained at the time of clinical trial enrolment in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Cohort Adult patients aged 18–72 years old with HL, CLL, B- or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (excluding Burkitt lymphoma and MYC-rearranged DLBCL) undergoing their first allogeneic HSCT with an 8/8 human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated allogeneic donor were eligible for the clinical trial. Between June 2009 and Septem- ber 2012, 139 patients were enrolled to the clinical trial, including 118 participants enrolled at the Dana–Farber Can- cer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital who were eligible for this retrospective study. Details of the transplan- tation regimen are described elsewhere (Armand et al, 2016a). Participants underwent conventional restaging at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, as per protocol. Acute and chronic GVHD were graded by the treating physician according to the relevant guidelines (Shulman et al, 1980; Przepiorka et al, 1995). ',\n"," 'PBMC and plasma (2–3 6 ml) samples were prospec- tively collected and banked prior to HSCT and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after HSCT, or until relapse. Only patients who consented to optional research specimen collec- tion and use at the time of informed consent and who had available archival biopsy samples containing sufficient tumour for nucleic acid extraction and sequencing analysis (approximately ≥15 ng of DNA) were included in this retro- spective study. Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene sequencing Genomic tumour DNA was extracted from archival forma- lin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or bone marrow aspirate mononuclear cells and analysed as previously described (Faham et al, 2012). In brief, polymerase chain reaction amplification of IGH VDJ, IGH DJ, IGK, TRB (TCR-beta), TRD (TCR-delta) and/or TRG (TCR-gamma) regions was performed using universal consensus primers fol- lowed by next-generation sequencing to determine the tumour clonotype(s) (Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp.). tumour clonotype was defined as a clone with a frequency of >5% in the tumour specimen. DNA from banked plasma and PBMC samples was extracted using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) for cell- free DNA and the AllPrep kit (Qiagen) for cell-based DNA. DNA was amplified using universal consensus primers and sequenced. The abundance of ctDNA was quantified relative to the total number of sequencing reads in a specimen – the number of lymphoma molecules per diploid genome sequenced. Both plasma and PBMCs were evaluated in all patients at all time points when specimens were available. Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics were reported descriptively. Fisher’s exact test or a Chi-square test was used for group compar- ison of categorical variables. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for group comparison of continuous variables. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were calculated using the Kaplan– Meier method. OS was defined as the time from stem cell infusion until death from any cause. Patients who were alive Herrera et al 2 ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology or lost to follow-up were censored at the time last seen alive. PFS was defined as the time from stem cell infusion until progression of disease or death from any cause. Patients who were alive without disease relapse or progres- sion were censored at the time last seen alive and progres- sion-free. ',\n"," 'Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse/progression (CIR) were calculated reflecting time to non-relapse death and time to relapse, respectively, as competing risks. The log-rank test was used to compare OS and PFS between subgroups, while the Gray test (Gray, 1988) was used to compare NRM and CIR inci- dences. A sample was considered positive for ctDNA if there were ANY detectable lymphoma molecules in the specimen. A patient was considered ctDNA positive at a given time point if ctDNA was detected in at least one sample tested from that time point, i.e. PBMC and/or plasma. The end- points of interest for this study were CIR and PFS. Univari- ate and multivariate analyses for CIR and PFS were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model treating ctDNA positivity as a time-dependent covariate along with disease status at HSCT and lymphoma histology. All tests were two-sided at the significance level of 0 05. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9 3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results Patients and HSCT outcomes Among the 139 patients enrolled on the clinical trial, 88 had paired tumour and blood samples available for analyses. Ten patients did not have sufficient tumour DNA for clonotype analysis and were not included in the study. Among the remaining 78, identification of a tumour clonotype was suc- cessful in 68 patients: 63 of 69 (91%) patients with NHL or CLL and 5 of 9 (55%) HL patients. Compared to the 71 patients who were not evaluable for ctDNA, these 68 patients were on average older and more commonly received stem cells from an unrelated donor (data not shown); despite those differences, their outcomes were similar [2-year PFS 61% in evaluable ctDNA cohort versus 58% (P = 0 5), and 2-year OS 71% vs. 68% (P = 0 4)]. The baseline characteris- tics of the 68 patients with identifiable tumour clonotypes and paired blood samples for ctDNA analysis are listed in Table I. There were 37 patients (54%) with B-cell NHL, 10 (15%) with T-cell NHL, 5 (7%) with HL and 16 (24%) with CLL. A summary of the clonotype identification rate by lym- phoma subtype is included in Table II. The median follow-up time for survivors was 33 months (3–60 months). Estimated 2-year PFS and OS in the cohort of 68 patients were 62% and 71%, respectively. ',\n"," 'Nineteen patients relapsed during the course of the study, at a median time of 3 9 months (range 1–28 months) from HSCT. The 2-year CIR was 25% and the 2-year incidence of NRM was 13%. PBMCs versus plasma results Cryopreserved peripheral blood samples (n = 797) were eval- uated for ctDNA, including 399 PBMC and 398 plasma sam- ples. The median concentration of cells in PBMC samples was 10 8 9106 mononuclear cells (range, 1–24 8 9 106 cells), and a median of 710 018 PBMC genomes (range, 9 146– 3 915 959) and 1 418 plasma genomes (range, 33–237 509) were analysed in each type of specimen. ctDNA was detected in 33% of PBMC and 25% of plasma specimens tested. Dis- cordance between PBMC and plasma samples, defined as detection of ctDNA in one type of specimen but not in the other, occurred at 85 of 386 (22%) time points in which both types of sample were tested.

PBMC /plasma+ discordance usually occurred in aggressive lymphoma subtypes: 86% of occurrences were in patients with DLBCL, HL or trans- formed indolent B-NHL. ctDNA positivity and outcome ctDNA analysis was performed at ≥1 time point in all 68 patients (Fig 1). Prior to HSCT, ctDNA was present in PBMCs or plasma in 55% of patients tested, including 9 of 23 (39%) patients in complete response (CR), 14 of 20 (70%) patients in partial response, 2 of 3 (67%) of patients with stable disease, and 1 (100%) patient with progressive disease. Using conventional staging methods as the gold stan- dard, the sensitivity of the assay was 71% for the detection of residual disease prior to HSCT. Baseline ctDNA status was not significantly associated with outcome: 2-year estimated CIR was 35% in ctDNA-positive versus 20% in ctDNA-nega- tive patients (p = 0 4) and 2-year PFS was 50% vs. 71% (P = 0 19). ctDNA was detectable in 60% of patients at 1 month, 55% at 2 months and 52% at 3 months. The proportion of patients with detectable ctDNA declined at time points fur- ther from HSCT: 36% at 6 months, 21% at 1 year and 10% at 2 years. Receipt of sirolimus did not impact the rates of ctDNA-positivity at baseline (50% ctDNA-positive in siroli- mus-receiving patients vs. 61% in control, P = 0 6) or 3 months after HSCT (48% sirolimus vs. 56% control, P = 0 8). At 1, 2 and 3 months after HSCT, detectable ctDNA had a sensitivity of 69%, 73% and 73%, respectively, for subsequent relapse/disease progression and a specificity of 45%, 55% and 55%, respectively. Among the 52 patients evaluated for ctDNA at 3 months after HSCT, the 2-year estimated CIR was 27% in patients who were ctDNA-positive versus 8% in ctDNA-negative patients (P = 0 12); 2-year NRM was 15% vs. 8% (P = 0 3); and 2-year PFS was 58% vs. 84% (P = 0 033), respectively (Fig 2). Overall, among the 19 patients who had progression or relapse after HSCT, ctDNA was detected prior to or at the time of relapse/progression in 17 (89%) patients. ',\n"," 'One patient with HL was ctDNA-negative prior to relapse, but had detectable ctDNA at the time of relapse. Thus, ctDNA was detected overall in 16 of 19 (84%) patients prior to docu- mented relapse or progression (Fig 1). In patients with detectable ctDNA prior to relapse, ctDNA was detected at a median of 3 7 months (range, 1–26 months) prior to relapse/progression. We examined the concordance between ctDNA and con- ventional restaging in patients who relapsed/progressed (Fig 1). Seven patients had detectable ctDNA in the setting of negative imaging at ≥1 time point prior to the docu- mented relapse/progression event. One of these patients later had imaging confirmation of isolated central nervous system relapse of DLBCL and negative ctDNA at that time. Only one patient had imaging consistent with relapsed systemic lymphoma but undetectable ctDNA. Another patient was ctDNA-negative at the only time point evaluated (1 month), but did not have a sample evaluable for ctDNA when imag- ing demonstrated relapse 3 5 months after HSCT. In the remaining 10 patients, detectable ctDNA either occurred between disease reassessment time points (i.e. 1, 2 or 9 months after HSCT) prior to subsequent concordant ctDNA-positive documented relapse (n = 6) or ctDNA-posi- tivity was concordant with active, stable or relapsed disease determined by conventional restaging methods (n = 4). Kinetic patterns of ctDNA after HSCT In patients with more than one ctDNA sampling time point prior to relapse, death or data censoring (n = 64), we observed kinetic patterns to describe the presence or absence of ctDNA before and after HSCT. Thirteen patients had detectable ctDNA at all time points tested, and nine (69%) of these patients had relapse/progression after HSCT. Two persistently ctDNA-positive CLL patients did not have dis- ease progression but actually had evidence of persistent active disease after HSCT and had detectable ctDNA at all time points tested. These patients were not formally considered as having relapse/progression because there was no overt Table II. Clonotype identification summary.

Eighteen patients were ctDNA-negative at all time points measured, and only 2 (11%) of these per- sistently ctDNA-negative patients relapsed. Eight patients had a mixed ctDNA pattern, with alternating periods of ctDNA- positivity and ctDNA clearance, among whom 2 relapsed. Three patients who were initially ctDNA-negative subse- quently became ctDNA-positive after HSCT without subse- quent ctDNA clearance. Two of these were DLBCL patients (Fig 1, patients 40 and 43) who became ctDNA-positive late after HSCT, at 9 months and 18 months, and subsequently relapsed at 10 and 24 months, respectively. An HL patient (Fig 1, patient 65) was ctDNA-negative prior to HSCT and then became ctDNA positive 1 month after HSCT and remained ctDNA-positive until relapse 3 months after HSCT. Twenty-two patients were consistently ctDNA-positive at ≥1 time point followed by permanent clearance of ctDNA. No patient with delayed, permanent ctDNA clearance had relapse or progression.

In 68% of patients with delayed ctDNA clear- ance, the onset of GVHD occurred before or within 3 months after the transition from ctDNA-positive to ctDNA-negative (Fig 1). All 21 patients with permanent ctDNA clearance who had GVHD remained free from relapse. ',\n"," 'The proportions of patients who had delayed ctDNA clearance, or were persistently ctDNA positive or negative, were similar among patients who received sirolimus as GVHD prophylaxis compared to patients in the control group (P = 0 2). Multivariate analysis A multivariate model was constructed with histology and dis- ease status at HSCT as covariates, and ctDNA-positivity included as a time-dependent covariate. ctDNA-positivity was associated with an increased risk of progression or death, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3 9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1 6–9 5; P = 0 003], as well as an increased risk of dis- ease relapse/progression (HR 10 8, 95% CI 2 8–42 2, P = 0 0006). Histology and disease status were not signifi- cantly associated with either outcome in the model. When acute and chronic GVHD were entered into the proportional hazards model as time-dependent covariates, along with remission status and ctDNA-positivity; chronic GVHD was associated with a lower risk of disease relapse/progression (HR 0 2, 95% CI 0 05–0 96, P = 0 045), while ctDNA-posi- tivity remained associated with an increased risk of disease relapse/progression (HR 8 2, 95% CI 2 5–26 6, P = 0 0004). ctDNA and chimerism In surviving patients with available chimerism, the median total and T-cell donor chimerism at 3 months after HSCT were 97% (n = 60, range, 32–100%) and 90% (n = 49, range, 8–100), respectively. Bivariate landmark analyses at 3 months after HSCT with ctDNA-positivity and total or T-cell chimerism as covariates showed that the presence of ctDNA was independently associated with an increased risk of progression or death (HR 2 9, 95% CI 1 02–8 4, P = 0 046), as was total donor chimerism <90% (HR 3 6, 95% CI 1 13–11 4, p = 0 030). T-cell chimerism was not sig- nificantly associated with outcome in the model when ctDNA-positivity was considered. Discussion NGS-based MRD assessment by immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene sequencing is highly sensitive and has shown promise in a range of lymphoid malignancies (Faham et al, 2012; Gawad et al, 2012; Armand et al, 2013, 2016b; Logan et al, 2013, 2014; Ladetto et al, 2014; Kurtz et al, 2015; Oki et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). ',\n"," 'In the present study, we report the first use of NGS-based MRD detection of lym- phoma after allogeneic RIC HSCT in a cohort of patients with a large variety of histologies, including HL, CLL, B-cell NHL and T-cell NHL. With a successful clonotype identifica- tion rate of 91% in NHL and CLL patients with adequate archival tumour samples, this technique is readily applicable to the majority of lymphoma patients undergoing HSCT. The exception was the clonotype identification rate (55%) in HL patients with adequate tumour samples, which is lower than was observed in a previous report (Oki et al, 2015). This may be explained by the histological characteristics of HL, in which there are few malignant cells among many reactive, inflammatory cells. Thus, in some patients with HL and the small proportion of patients with NHL and CLL in whom no clonotype can be identified, this technique may not be applicable. Overall, ctDNA was detected in 55% of patients prior to HSCT, including 39% of patients considered to be in CR at the time of HSCT. Some patients with persistent disease prior to HSCT by conventional restaging did not have detectable ctDNA, which may reflect limitations of the assay but also probably reflects the common occurrence of false positive fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) after standard therapy (Moskowitz et al, 2010). Some degree of discordance between conventional restaging and this technique is expected, as other studies have reported a ctDNA-positivity rate of 81–92% at the time of diagnosis in patients with DLBCL (Armand et al, 2013; Kurtz et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). Therefore, in a small propor- tion of patients in whom a clonotype can be identified, the assay may not be useful for tracking disease. In addition to discordance between conventional restaging methods and ctDNA assessment, discordance between the presence of ctDNA in PBMC versus plasma samples from the same patient assessed at the same time point was common. aggressive lymphomas, evaluation of plasma appeared more sensitive for the detection of ctDNA, which may reflect higher cell turnover and shedding of cell-free ctDNA in these subtypes. Furthermore, testing for ctDNA in the PBMC com- partment may be impacted by persistent leucopenia after HSCT, which could potentially limit sensitivity. This may be especially true in patients who receive more intensive condi- tioning or grafts from alternative donors, in whom engraft- ment may be slower. ',\n"," 'Therefore, in future studies, evaluation of both PBMC and plasma should be performed when possi- ble to maximize the sensitivity of the assay. In parallel to the high rates of MRD-positivity observed early after HSCT in other studies of MRD monitoring after RIC HSCT, many patients had detectable ctDNA in the early post-HSCT period (Dreger et al, 2010; Logan et al, 2013). The proportion of patients with detectable ctDNA remained relatively stable until 3 months after HSCT then declined steadily. The decreasing proportion of ctDNA-positive patients was partially due to drop out of patients with relapse/progression. However, approximately one-third of patients had permanent clearance of ctDNA after initial ctDNA-positivity. This kinetic pattern of ctDNA clearance Herrera et al 6 ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology was associated with freedom from relapse (no relapses in our cohort) and similar patterns of delayed MRD clearance have been observed in studies of MRD monitoring after HSCT in other diseases (Miglino et al, 2002; Moreno et al, 2006; Rit- gen et al, 2008; Farina et al, 2009; Dreger et al, 2010). Delayed ctDNA clearance may have been temporally related with immunosuppression taper, which started at day +100 per protocol. Most patients (68%) with delayed ctDNA clear- ance developed GVHD prior to or around the time of the transition between ctDNA-positive to ctDNA-negative. Fur- thermore, in some patients with a mixed ctDNA pattern, periods of ctDNA clearance were immediately preceded by the onset of GVHD. In other studies of MRD monitoring after RIC HSCT, clearance of MRD was often associated with the onset of GVHD or immunosuppression taper (Moreno et al, 2006; Ritgen et al, 2008; Farina et al, 2009; Dreger et al, 2010) The relationship between GVHD and disappear- ance of ctDNA observed in this study is evidence of a graft- versus-lymphoma effect. In our study, nearly all (89%) patients with relapse or progression of disease after HSCT had detectable ctDNA prior to or at the time of relapse/progression. Eighty-four per cent of patients had detectable ctDNA at 1 or more time point prior to relapse/progression, and the median lead-time of ctDNA-positivity prior to relapse/progression was more than 3 months. Many relapses were detected radiographically as part of the protocol-specified disease reassessments rather than clinically-detected relapses; therefore, the lead-time interval we observed was partly a function of the protocol- driven timing of blood draws and disease reassessments. ',\n"," 'Notably, prior to the time point of confirmed relapse, several patients who ultimately relapsed had detectable ctDNA in the setting of negative imaging, while ctDNA-negativity with positive imaging occurred less frequently. Our findings sug- gest that NGS-based assessment of ctDNA after HSCT is very sensitive for relapse. This high sensitivity could possibly allow more judicious use of routine restaging scans, which are associated with significant costs and radiation expo- sure. (Brenner & Hall, 2007; Berrington de Gonzalez et al, 2009) Because we evaluated the assay as a method of predict- ing future relapse/progression, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the assay to be reflective of subsequent relapse, rather than active disease at a particular time point. Therefore, the calculated sensitivity at early post-HSCT time points was relatively lower, as there were patients who had no detectable ctDNA and negative imaging early after HSCT but later became ctDNA positive at least 1 time point prior to subsequent relapse/progression, which has been observed in other studies using this technique (Roschewski et al, 2015). Although NGS-based ctDNA detection appeared sensitive for relapse, there were patients who had detectable ctDNA after HSCT who did not relapse. This apparent lack of speci- ficity of the assay is at least partly explained by the distinc- tion between residual disease and relapse/progression in the clinical trial. Some patients enrolled in the clinical trial had residual disease prior to and after HSCT but were never clas- sified as having frank relapse or progression. As a result, there were patients with evidence of active, stable disease by conventional restaging methods after HSCT in whom the assay appropriately detected ctDNA, but appeared to have falsely positive MRD status because they did not relapse or progress. More generally, this high early “false positive” rate reflects the realities of RIC HSCT – less intensive condition- ing therapy results in more macro- or microscopic residual disease in the early post-HSCT period, with graft-versus- tumour effects developing over time. Thus, the presence of ctDNA after HSCT in many patients who do not ultimately relapse or progress would be expected. Nevertheless, ctDNA positivity at 3 months after HSCT was significantly associ- ated with inferior PFS. In addition, multivariate analyses confirmed that detectable ctDNA was independently associ- ated with an increased risk of relapse/progression and pro- gression/death, even when GVHD and total or T-cell donor chimerism were taken into account. ',\n"," 'If these findings can be validated in other studies and the specificity for subsequent relapse could be improved, detectable ctDNA after HSCT may provide an actionable result for therapeutic intervention to forestall clinically overt relapse. One of the strengths of this study – the variety of histolo- gies included – is also a limitation. The heterogeneous mix- ture of patients with different subtypes of NHL and HL limits our ability to draw conclusions about the assay’s per- formance in individual lymphoma subtypes. In addition, although we started with a possible study population of 118 patients, only 88 patients had archival tissue available for tumour clonotype identification, only 78 had sufficient tumour DNA for evaluation, and 68 patients with an ade- quate tumour sample had a tumour clonotype successfully identified. Differing tissue fixation techniques utilized at the various institutions from which tumour tissue was obtained and originally processed may have impacted tumour clono- type identification. Even among patients with an identifiable clonotype, there were missing blood samples despite the prospectively planned sample collection within the context of a clinical trial. The missing time points decrease the power of the study, particularly in patients with early relapse and few opportunities to detect ctDNA prior to progression. More generally, these issues highlight the importance of prospectively archiving tumour samples and of routinely and frequently collecting PBMC and plasma samples whenever possible in patients in whom MRD measurement may become desirable at some point in their treatment course. Finally, as this study only examined patients who underwent RIC HSCT using fully HLA-matched or single mismatched donors, we are unable to comment about the assay’s utility in patients who receive more intensive conditioning or a graft from other donor types. In this pilot study of NGS-based ctDNA detection in patients with lymphoma undergoing HSCT, we observed that NGS-Based ctDNA Detection After HSCT for Lymphoma ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology 7 the presence of ctDNA after HSCT was associated with an increased risk of relapse and inferior PFS. Although our find- ings are promising, validation studies with pre-defined end- points are necessary. With further validation, the detection of ctDNA in the setting of radiographic disease progression could also potentially serve to confirm disease recurrence without the need for a tissue biopsy. ',\n"," 'Further studies are required to establish the clinical utility of NGS-based ctDNA detection after HSCT, including how best to prospectively incorporate this assay into post-HSCT monitoring, the utility of the test in specific lymphoma subtypes, and whether the test is sufficiently specific to justify MRD-based intervention. We have identified specific situations that appear to be promising targets for further exploration, including ctDNA status in conjunction with GVHD status and ctDNA-positiv- ity 3 months after HSCT. As interest grows in novel approaches for preventing relapse after HSCT, NGS-based MRD detection should be incorporated into prospective clin- ical trials to further study and optimize the use of this poten- tially promising technique in this patient population.

The nerve involvement was the only CG- related clinical manifestation in four patients; three of whom had confounding factors, such as alcoholism and/or vitamin B deficiency. These three patients had moderate symptoms and did not receive any specific treatment. Six patients had central neurological manifestations: four presented isolated ischaemic strokes and two had impaired consciousness associated with convulsions in the context of a systemic presentation with multivisceral manifestations, fever and polyarthralgia. Miscellaneous Five patients presented with systemic symptoms (fever >38°C, asthenia and weight loss) that were associated with cutaneous manifestations, particularly necrotic purpura of the extremities, and polyarthralgia in four.

Summary This retrospective analysis was conducted in 64 patients diagnosed with type I cryoglobulinaemia (CG) followed at two French centres. Median fol- low-up was 6 75 years. CG was IgG in 60% and IgM in 40% of all cases and was asymptomatic in 16 patients (25%). Cold-triggered ischaemic skin manifestations were observed in 33 patients (51%). Neurological manifesta- tions were observed in 15 patients and renal manifestations in 13. ',\n"," 'Most of the patients with necrotic purpura (14/16, P = 0 009) and renal manifesta- tions (11/13, P = 0 057) had IgG CG. IgG CG was associated with mono- clonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma in 18, 13, 5 and 2 patients, respectively. IgM CG was associated with MGUS and Waldenstr€om macroglobulinaemia in 8 and 18 cases, respectively. One third of patients did not receive any specific treatment. Various treatments, including rituximab, were administered to 25/31 patients with IgG CG and 6/25 patients with IgM CG due to CG-related symptoms. Rituximab was ineffective in all cases associated with a predominantly plasmacytic prolifer- ation. To conclude, type I CG has specific clinico-biological characteristics compared to type II CG. Furthermore, there are differences in terms of related manifestations between type I IgG and type I IgM CG. Keywords: monoclonal gammopathy, cryoglobulinaemia. The medical condition cryoglobulinaemia (CG) is character- ized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the serum. Cryo- globulins are immunoglobulins (Ig) that precipitate when the serum drops to a temperature lower than 37°C and dissolve again once the serum is heated. Three types of CG have been described (Brouet et al, 1974): type I, or monoclonal CG, is composed of a monoclonal Ig (mIg); type II, ‘mixed’ CG, is composed of an mIg (usually an IgMj with rheumatoid fac- tor (RF) activity) associated with polyclonal Igs; and type III, which is also known as polyclonal CG. Both type I and II CG are characterized by an mIg and, accordingly, by the presence of an underlying B-cell clone. This can result in an overt lymphoid proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstr€om macroglobulinaemia (WM) or a type of lym- phoma, or be silent corresponding to the definition of a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (Retamozo et al, 2013). In contrast to the numerous works that have been con- ducted on type II CG, particularly since the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been identified as its major cause (Ramos-Casals et al, 2012), there are only a few publications specifically reporting data on type I CG. We report a well-defined series of patients with this type of CG, providing further evidence that type I and type II CGs are distinct entities from clinical, histological and physico-pathological points of view. ',\n"," 'Patients and methods Our series of patients was retrospectively composed by com- bining a random approach with an oriented approach. The random series constituted all cases of type I CG identified by routine laboratory tests in patients presenting at a multidisci- plinary hospital, Strasbourg University Hospital, over a 4-year period (15 May 2006 to 31 May 2010). This series was combined with an oriented series composed of all patients diagnosed with type I CG that were followed in a specialized haematology centre: the Immuno-Haematology Unit of Paris-Saint-Louis Hospital. research paper ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology doi: 10.1111/bjh.13196 In all cases, CG was detected on a blood sample that was collected and transported at 37°C. The blood sample was left to clot at the same temperature and the centrifuged serum was then placed at 2–4°C for 7–8 days. At this time, if a pre- cipitate was discernible, it was washed three times at 4°C to remove any contaminating serum components. The CG was then semi-quantified (either using a pyrogallol red method or by evaluating a cryocrite), re-dissolved at 37°C and char- acterized by immunofixation. Patients were classified according to Brouet et al (1974). Only cases where the CG could be classified without any ambi- guity were included. Patients presenting with a low amount of IgM were carefully checked, particularly if they were HCV- positive and/or had mIgM RF activity, suggesting that they were more likely to have type II rather than type I CG. Available medical files and biological results of all patients with type I CG were retrospectively reviewed. All patients who were alive at the time of the study gave their informed consent. The results were compared to data from a literature review that was performed using the PubMed database with the terms ‘monoclonal cryoglobulinaemia’ and ‘cryoglobuli- naemia’. Results Out of the 6428 sera tested for CG in Strasbourg Hospital during the 4-year study period, 300 (4 7%) were positive. Thirty-one of these (10 3%) were characterized as type I CG. Four of these cases could not be included because of incom- plete or questionable data. In Paris Saint-Louis Hospital, 41 patients with a validated diagnosis of type I CG were identi- fied. Four cases could not be included because of incomplete data. Overall, 64 patients were analysed. ',\n"," 'Cutaneous symptoms were the only manifesta- tion of the CG in 12 patients. In five patients, symptoms were considered as too discrete to require any specific ther- apy, except avoiding exposure to the cold. In contrast, three patients had to undergo amputation of fingers or toes due to severe necrosis. When available (n = 9), histological examination of cuta- neous lesions usually showed a thrombotic vasculopathy, with capillary thromboses of the upper dermis and non- inflammatory purpura (Figs 1B and C). A significant perivas- cular cell infiltrate was reported in only one case. Vessel thrombosis was due to intravascular amorphous eosinophilic periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) positive material. It was associated with endothelial proliferation corresponding to glomeruloid reactive angioendotheliomatosis in two cases (Fig 2). In the only case with interpretable immunofluorescence (IF) data, the intravascular thrombi were stained only by the antisera specific for the light and heavy chain isotype of the CG. Renal manifestations Nine of the 13 patients who had had renal symptoms at some point were biopsied. The patient with salivary gland AL amyloidosis and pure nephrotic syndrome was not con- sidered as having renal complications due to CG. All of these 13 patients had high-grade proteinuria pre- dominantly consisting of albumin, including eight who had a nephrotic syndrome. It was pure in one case, whereas three had renal failure and four had hypertension and/or haematu- ria. Five patients had recurrent flares characterized by nephritic syndrome, acute renal failure and severe hyperten- sion. Renal involvement was isolated, associated with cutane- ous symptoms or with systemic symptoms in seven, three and three patients, respectively. It was present at diagnosis in seven patients and occurred during disease progression in the other six. Eleven of the 38 patients with IgG CG had renal involve- ment, as compared to two of the 26 patients with IgM CG (P = 0 057 by Fisher’s test). Histologically, the disease was characterized by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with glomerular thrombi and micro-tubular deposits in seven Table II. Clinical manifestations according to type I CG isotype. ',\n"," 'The mean age at diagnosis was 62 years, there were 33 women and 31 men, and median follow-up was 6 75 years. In nearly half of the patients, the CG was incidentally dis- covered during the work-up for a monoclonal gammapathy or a lymphoid disorder. In these cases, CG was diagnosed following a cold-induced serum precipitate that alerted the pathologist. In 32 patients (50%), the patients were tested for CG because of cutaneous symptoms. Otherwise, the CG was discovered because of renal (n = 7) or neurological (n = 8) complications. Five patients had systemic disease (see below). Biological characteristics The 64 monoclonal CG were of the IgM or IgG isotype in 26 (40%) and 38 (60%) cases, respectively. There were 19 IgMj, 7 IgMk, 22 IgGj and 16 IgGk. In four cases, a second mIg was detected by serum immunofixation but only one of these was cryoprecipitating. The two IgG that were subclassified belonged to IgG1 and IgG3 isotype. At diagnosis, the CG amount was low (≤0 1 g/l or cryocrite ≤1%, n = 17), medium (≤1 g/l or cryocrite ≤2%, n = 19), high (≤5 g/l or cryocrite ≤10%, n = 14), very high (≤20 g/l or cryocrite ≤50%, n = 10) or massive (>20 g/l or cryocrite >50%, n = 4). As assessed by serum electrophoresis, the serum level of the mIg was not always correlated with the estimated amount of the CG. Two patients had mIg of 30 g/l or more, contrast- ing with a low (<2%) cryocrite (1 IgMj, 1 IgGj). Serum complement levels (CH50, C3 and C4) were in normal ranges in 26 of the 48 evaluable patients. A decrease in CH50 and/or C4 levels was observed in 22 patients, nine of whom also had a low C3 serum level. There was no corre- lation between complement status and clinical symptoms. Forty-one patients were tested for serum RF and 37 for anti- nuclear antibodies and were positive in two and five cases, respectively. Associated disorders In all but four patients the work-up included at least one bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. All patients with an IgG CG had a complete bone survey (Table I). All patients with an IgM CG had a thoraco-abdominal computerized tomogra- phy-scan or at least an ultrasound examination of the abdo- men. A lymph node biopsy was performed in all of the six patients with sizeable peripheral lymphadenopathy. ',\n"," 'Twenty-six patients (40%) were considered to have a MGUS whereas 38 patients (60%) had an overt lymphopro- liferative disorder. The 38 patients with an IgG CG were ini- tially diagnosed with MGUS (n = 18), MM (n = 13, including 11 indolent MM), lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma (LPL) (n = 2) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 5, including one case with auto-immune haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia). During follow-up, one MGUS patient and two with indolent MM developed a symptomatic MM. In one case, an IgGj MGUS was associ- ated with a necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Among the 26 patients with an IgM CG, 18 presented with WM that was asymptomatic in seven cases, symptomatic Table I. Associated disorders at diagnosis.

In two patients, a cryoprecipitating IgM MGUS featured a cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Two patients with an IgM CG were also diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, on a salivary gland biopsy in one case (performed because of a pure nephrotic syndrome) and on a lymph node biopsy in the other. One patient with an IgMj MGUS also had type 1 Gaucher disease. CG-related manifestations Cutaneous symptoms. At diagnosis and during follow-up, 33 patients (51%) – 23 with an IgG CG and 10 with an IgM – had cutaneous involvement attributable to CG (Table II). variably combined the following: Raynaud phenomenon (n = 12), livedo reticularis (n = 11), recurrent episodes of cold-induced necrotic purpura of the extremities (n = 16) and urticaria, either cold-related (n = 5) or not (n = 3) (Fig 1A). Of the 16 patients with necrotic purpura, 14 had an IgG CG whereas only two had an IgM CG (P = 0 009 by Fisher test). ',\n"," 'In addition, two had a peripheral sensorimotorneuropathyandthreedisplayedischaemicvisceral manifestations including cerebral manifestations and mesen- teric ischaemia. Three patients presented with acute kidney fail- ure and one of these also had heart failure. Three of these patients had an IgG CG and two an IgM CG. Microscopical examinationof the cryoprecipitate showed the presenceofcrys- tals with thin needles in one case with an IgG3 CG. In three cases, the CG serum level was high, one was medium and the onewithcrystalshadalowlevel. Apart from the patients with systemic presentation, eight patients had articular manifestations, namely inflammatory poly- or oligo-arthralgia. These were never isolated and usu- ally associated with cutaneous symptoms. No joint aspira- tions or synovial biopsies were performed. Arterial ischaemic manifestations occurred in three patients [spleen infarction (n = 1), suspicion of mesenteric ischaemia (n = 1) and acute ischaemia of the leg (n = 1)] and thrombo-embolic events were observed in eight patients, four of whom had detectable serum antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment. Eighteen patients (28%) did not receive any spe- cific treatment at any time, including 11 of the 38 patients with IgG CG and seven of the 26 patients with IgM CG. Among these untreated patients, 11 had an MGUS (seven IgG, four IgM), four had CLL and three had indolent WM. Two haemodialysed patients did not receive any specific treatment because they had no other organ failure and were too frail. Forty-six patients received chemotherapy. Indications to treat were linked to the underlying haemopathy in 15 patients, because of high tumour mass (MM, n = 2; WM, n = 9 including two with Richter syndrome) or of associated manifestations such as CAD, AL amyloidosis and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (Fig 3). Treatment was initiated because of CG-related symptoms in 31 patients, including 25 of the 38 patients with IgG CG (66%) and six of the 26 patients with IgM CG (24%). Patients with IgG CG and MGUS or MM received various standard dose chemotherapeutic regimens either based on al- kylating agents (n = 13, 42%), anthracycline (n = 1, 3%), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (n = 9, 29%) or bortezo- mib (n = 10, 32%). Four (10%) were treated by high dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Seven others received repeated injections of ritux- imab. The three patients with IgG CG and CLL or LPL received a combination of rituximab and cyclophosphamide. ',\n"," 'Patients with IgM CG were treated by an alkylating agent- based regimen (n = 6) or rituximab alone (n = 1) (Table III). In all cases, there was a good correlation between the improvement of CG-related symptoms and variation in the mIg level. All CG-related symptoms disappeared in the two patients who achieved an apparent complete remission post-ASCT. In contrast, two other transplanted patients did not achieve a good haematological response and remained clinically symptomatic. Patients with a predominantly Fig 2.

Rituximab alone was also ineffective in the patient with IgM CG who received this treatment although there was no evidence of disease exacerbation. Repeated complete plasmatic exchanges (PE) were per- formed in 12 patients, two with an IgM CG and 10 with an IgG. Indications were severe skin necrosis in eight cases, renal manifestations in two cases and systemic presentation in another two. PE, usually performed three times a week during the first week and then progressively spaced, was used in combination with various chemo- and steroid-based regi- mens. In all cases, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical improvement, including in the two patients who pre- sented with acute kidney failure. Disease progression and complications. At diagnosis, 28 patients were not treated because they only had a few symptoms and an MGUS or indolent lymphoid disorder. With a median of follow up of 6 75 years (range: 1–20 years), the situation remained stable for 18 of these patients whereas a symptomatic MM (n = 1) or WM (n = 2) occurred in three patients. CG-related symptoms worsened in seven other patients who experienced painful necrotic pur- pura (n = 5), renal manifestations (n = 1) or both (n = 1). Fifteen patients died during follow-up. Death was a direct consequence of the underlying haemopathy in six patients including one patient who died because of cerebral vascular complications resistant to PE, corticosteroids and cyclophos- phamide. Five patients died because of infection and three as a result of lung, uterine or bladder cancers. ',\n"," 'Two, 5 and 10-year estimated overall survivals were 87% [75–93], 83% [69–90] and 68% [49–81], respectively (Fig 4). Discussion In our series, which included only cases with unambiguous typing of the CG, type I CG represented about 10% of all cases of CG that were detected in the central laboratory of a general multidisciplinary hospital. Similar rates are reported in the literature, but with large variations of between 4 6% and 38% (Brouet et al, 1974; Monti et al, 1995; Trejo et al, 2001; Rieu et al, 2002; N eel et al, 2014). Forty percent of type I CG in our series was of IgM isotype and 60% of IgG isotype. Previous series have reported a roughly similar distribution (Brouet et al, 1974; Monti et al, 1995; Trejo et al, 2001; Rieu et al, 2002; Terrier et al, 2013). Only three cases of mIgA and one of isolated LC CG have been published (Brouet et al, 1974; Gorevic et al, 1980). One of the two IgG CG that were sub-classified in the present series was IgG3, in accordance with the unexpected proportion of IgG3 that has been reported (Abraham et al, 1979) together with the tendency of this isotype to self-associate and cryoprecipitate, as confirmed in an experimental mouse model (Abdelmoula et al, 1989).

Overall survival. Type I Monoclonal Cryoglobulinaemia ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology 5 symptoms located on the extremities including Raynaud phe- nomenon, retiform or stellar purpura and skin necrosis (Bro- uet et al, 1974; Cohen et al, 1991; Trejo et al, 2001; Lipsker & Boeckler, 2007; Terrier et al, 2013). Palpable purpura related to leucocytoclastic vasculitis, which is the hallmark of mixed type II CG, is rarely observed, if ever. Painful leg ulcers, usually located in the distal part of the legs, are also frequent. Cold urticaria, observed in five of our patients, is also suggestive of CG (Rongioletti et al, 2008). Skin biopsy characteristically reveals dilated small vessels occluded by an eosinophilic, PAS positive material, associ- ated with extravasation of erythrocytes and absent or moder- ate mononuclear perivascular infiltrate. The infiltrate is taken to reflect true leucocytoclastic vasculitis in up to one-third of cases (Auzerie et al, 2003). Reactive proliferation of endothe- lial cells resembling glomeruloid reactive angioendothelioma- tosis may be observed (Fig 2), similar to patients with POEMS (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy or Oedema, M-protein and Skin abnormalities) or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes (Creamer et al, 2000). Thus, type I CG-related cutaneous symptoms are likely to be due to intravascular precipitation of the mIg triggered by cold exposure, thrombotic obstruction of the vessels and ischae- mia of the underlying skin (Della Rossa et al, 2003). This physiopathology is different from that of type II mixed CG, which is consecutive to immune complex deposits in the vas- cular walls, consumption of the main complement pathway and chemo-attraction of cells forming the peri-vascular infil- trate characteristic of true leucocytoclastic vasculitis (Feiner, 1983). Serum complement levels were abnormal in about half of our cases, probably because of complement activation by Ig aggregates rather than immune complex formation. note, however, some mIg may cryoprecipitate only when binding their specific antigen, as exemplified by one anti- ganglioside IgM (Yeni et al, 1984). Kidney involvement was reported in 20% of our patients as compared to 25% and 40% in two other series (Brouet et al, 1974; Trejo et al, 2001; N eel et al, 2014). ',\n"," 'Remarkably, renal manifestations complicate IgG type I CG much more often than IgM type I CG, which have only been previously reported in the chapter of a textbook (Koda et al, 1978). Renal lesions typically manifest as chronic glomerular disease with flares characterized by nephritic syndrome and acute kidney failure. Renal pathology shows membrano-prolifera- tive glomerulonephritis with glomerular thrombi made of the monoclonal CG (Hent et al, 1997; Galea et al, 2002; Karras et al, 2002). The presence of monotypic Ig deposits is highly suggestive of a cryoglobulinaemic kidney and their absence should put into question the diagnosis of CG. Typical glo- merular deposits made of IgM and IgG (and C3) point towards a diagnosis of type II rather than type I CG. This underlines the crucial importance of IF analysis. In addition, electron microscopy studies may be required especially when an atypical pattern is observed or when CG is undetectable in the serum (Santostefano et al, 2005). The incidence of neurological and joint manifestations varies between 5% and 30% from one series to another prob- ably because of differences in selection criteria. If performed, a nerve biopsy may show cryoglobulin deposits in the endo- neurium (Vital & Vital, 1993) or in the vasa nervorum with- out the true vasculitic perivascular cellular infiltrate that characterizes type II mixed CG-related neuropathy. Central nervous system involvement is rare (Ballouch et al, 2007; Alt- unay et al, 2012) in contrast to the ischaemic stroke that can complicate mixed type II CG due to HCV. Joint manifesta- tions may be associated with fever, impaired general condi- tion and necrotic skin lesions and patients presenting with these symptoms should be tested for crystal-CG, which usu- ally involves an mIgG3 (Rengers et al, 2000). Interestingly, CG crystals are identified in the synovium of involved joints demonstrating that joint involvement is consecutive to gout- like micro-crystalline arthropathy (Aarset et al, 2002). In contrast to the sometimes life-threatening manifestations, type I CG can also be asymptomatic. Of note, six of our asymp- tomatic or nearly asymptomatic patients had very high or mas- sive serum cryoglobulinlevels and, conversely,five patients with seriouscomplicationshadlowcryoglobulin.Theclinicalseverity of type I CG is more likely to be linked to the temperature at which precipitation occurs, which is not the case in type II CG where symptoms are more orthostatic rather than cold-related (Gorevic et al, 1980). ',\n"," 'In our asymptomatic patients, type I CG was sometimes discovered because of the incidental finding of a precipitate in a serum sample or of amorphous crystals in a bloodsmear,aspreviouslyreported(Shiratoet al,2009).Intwo cases it was discovered during the work-up for a CAD, where the monoclonal cold agglutinin IgM can also precipitate at a lowtemperature(Pujolet al,1998;Ciejkaet al,1999). Regardless of how type I CG is initially detected, the implications are the same as for any mIg, i.e. exploration should be conducted for an underlying haematological disor- der, which may be characterized sometimes years after dis- covering the CG. There are only a few publications regarding the manage- ment of type I CG. All patients should carefully avoid expo- sure to the cold and take appropriate protective measures. Aspirin antiplatelet, or even anticoagulation therapy, could be administered if cutaneous necrosis or livedo reticularis is present, although it has not been proved to be effective. However, most investigators would agree that regular moni- toring alone is sufficient for patients with few CG-related symptoms. The risk of developing an overt lympho€ıd disor- der or cryo-related complications outlines the importance of regular follow-up and may argue in favour of incorporating routine CG screening in the case of any mIg or of B-cell lymphoid proliferation. When CG-related symptoms are severe, complete PE is indicated, even though no prospective studies have established their efficacy or optimal use (Shaw et al, 1985; Della Rossa et al, 2003; Vila et al, 2004; Rockx & Clark, 2010). Otherwise, in patients with symptomatic and/or pro- Harel et al 6 ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology gressive disease, targeting the underlying B-cell clone is the main therapeutic option. Here, the key point is to adapt treatment modalities to the nature of the underlying gamm- opathy. If it is plasmacytic (i.e. mainly composed of CD20 negative cells and usually secreting an mIgG), the treatment should be based on anti-myeloma agents (Sampson & Callen, 2006; Talamo et al, 2008; Spizzo et al, 2010; Calabrese et al, 2011) including, in selected young patients with severe dis- ease, HDM with ASCT. If the underlying B-cell disorder is lympho-plasmacytic, usually associated with an mIgM, the treatment should be as for WM (Dimopoulos et al, 2009). As renal function is frequently altered in symptomatic patients, a combination of high dose steroids and cyclophos- phamide was previously the reference treatment of type I CG. ',\n"," 'Therapeutic options now include bortezomib, IMiDs (particularly thalidomide, which is not eliminated by the kid- ney) and bendamustine. Rituximab, the therapeutic interest of which is well-established in mixed type II CG (Zaja et al, 2003; Terrier et al, 2010), was effective in five of the seven reported patients with type I CG (Nehme-Schuster et al, 2005; Pandrangi et al, 2008; Shaikh et al, 2008; Akiyama et al, 2011; Wink et al, 2011). Only one of these responders had an IgG CG. Similarly, rituximab was effective in only one of our five IgG MM or MGUS patients who received this treatment. Thus, patients with a predominantly plasmacytic underlying B-cell proliferation do not appear to benefit from a treatment that might be thought to act on plasma cell pre- cursors. Rituximab should therefore only be used when the secreting B-cell clone is demonstrated to be CD20-positive or is likely to be so. Of note, its administration may be followed by a transient disease exacerbation (Nehme-Schuster et al, 2005), similar to the so-called flare that may occur in WM or in hepatitis C-associated type II CG (S ene et al, 2009). In conclusion, the present series confirms that the distinc- tion between type I and type II CG, that was made nearly 40 years ago, remains fully relevant. Indeed, both situations are different from clinical, histological and physico-patholog- ical points of view and require different therapeutic approaches. In addition, the present series shows that type I IgG and IgM CG are associated with different clinical mani- festations and require ‘personalized’ treatment according to the disease characteristics and based on the underlying hae- matological disorder.

This international phase 3 study compared the  effi cacy and tolerance of the standard therapy with a potentially less toxic combination consisting of bendamustine  and rituximab. Methods Treatment-naive fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (aged 33–81 years) without del(17p) were  enrolled after undergoing a central screening process. ',\n"," 'Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a computer-generated  randomisation list using randomly permuted blocks with a block size of eight and were stratifi ed according to  participating country and Binet stage. Patients were allocated to receive six cycles of intravenous fl udarabine (25 mg/m²  per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m² per day) for the fi rst 3 days or to intravenous bendamustine (90 mg/m²  per day) for the fi rst 2 days of each cycle. Rituximab 375 mg/m² was given intravenously in both groups on day 0 of  cycle 1 and subsequently was given at 500 mg/m² during the next fi ve cycles on day 1. The primary endpoint was  progression-free survival with the objective to assess non-inferiority of bendamustine and rituximab to the standard  therapy. We aimed to show that the 2-year progression-free survival with bendamustine and rituximab was not 67·5%  or less with a corresponding non-inferiority margin of 1·388 for the hazard ratio (HR) based on the 90·4% CI. The fi nal  analysis was done by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00769522. Findings 688 patients were recruited between Oct 2, 2008, and July 11, 2011, of which 564 patients who met inclusion  criteria were  randomly assigned. 561 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population: 282 patients in the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group and 279 in the bendamustine and rituximab group. After a median  observation time of 37·1 months (IQR 31·0–45·5) median progression-free survival was 41·7 months (95% CI  34·9–45·3) with bendamustine and rituximab and 55·2 months (95% CI not evaluable) with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (HR 1·643, 90·4% CI 1·308–2·064). As the upper limit of the 90·4% CI was greater  than 1·388 the null hypothesis for the corresponding non-inferiority hypothesis was not rejected. Severe neutropenia  and infections were more frequently observed with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (235 [84%] of 279 vs  164 [59%] of 278, and 109 [39%] vs 69 [25%], respectively) during the study. The increased frequency of infectious  complications with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab was more pronounced in patients older than 65 years. ',\n"," 'in patients older than 65 years. Interpretation The combination of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the standard front-line  therapy in fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but bendamustine and rituximab is associated with less  toxic eff ects.

Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the most common  leukaemia in high-income countries, had been considered  as incurable by conventional therapies.1 In general,  younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  have a reduced life expectancy.1 The introduction of  antibody-based chemo immunotherapy has improved the  outcome of younger patients by inducing long-lasting and  possibly durable remissions with a median progression- free survival of up to 80 months in subgroups of patients.2–4  Following the results of a phase 2 study by the MD  Anderson Cancer Center2 and a phase 3 study by the  German CLL Group, the CLL8 study,5 fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab have become the  Articles 2 www.thelancet.com/oncology Published online May 20, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30051-1 Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark  (T Plesner MD); First  Department of Medicine,  Charles University General  Hospital, Prague, Czech  Republic (Prof M Trneny MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine III, University of Ulm,  Ulm, Germany  (Prof H Döhner MD,  Prof S Stilgenbauer MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine II, University Hospital  of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus  Kiel, Kiel, Germany  (Prof M Kneba MD,  S Böttcher MD); Department I  of Internal Medicine, Klinikum  Schwabing, Munich, Germany  (Prof C-M Wendtner MD);  Haematopathology Section  and Lymph Node Registry,  Department of Pathology,  University of Kiel, Kiel,  Germany (Prof W Klapper MD);  and Cluster of Excellence on  Cellular Stress Responses in  Aging (CECAD), University of  Cologne, Cologne, Germany  (Prof M Hallek) Correspondence to: Dr Barbara Eichhorst, Department  I of Internal Medicine and Center  of Integrated Oncology Köln  Bonn, University of Cologne,  Cologne, Germany barbara.eichhorst@uk-koeln.de standard front-line therapy for physically fi t patients with  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, this regimen is  associated with substantial toxic eff ects, most importantly  severe haematotoxicity in 56% of patients and severe  infections in 25% of patients during treatment. ',\n"," 'A long- term follow-up of patients treated with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab showed prolonged  neutropenia in 17–35% and an elevated risk of secondary  neoplasia.4,6,7 The combination of the alkylating agent bendamustine  and rituximab has shown promising results in a phase 2  study in front-line therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  with overall responses in 103 (88%) of 117 patients and  complete responses in 27 (23%) of 117 patients.8 Event-free  survival of 34 months and low incidence of severe  neutropenia (20%) and infections (8%) led to the hypothesis  that front-line treatment with bendamustine and rituximab  might be similarly eff ective but less toxic compared with the  standard treatment. Therefore, the German CLL Study Group did an  international phase 3 study to test the non-inferiority of  bendamustine and rituximab versus fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in front-line therapy of  fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but  without del(17p). Methods  Study design and participants We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority  study in previously untreated fi t patients aged 33–81 years  with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who  required treatment according to the International  Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)  criteria9 and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) status of 0–2. Treatment-naive patients diagnosed with chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia were registered for central  screening, which was done by the German CLL Study  Group central study offi ce (Cologne, Germany) and  included immunophenotyping for confi rmation of the  diagnosis, fl uorescence-in-situ hybridisation (FISH) to  determine del(17p) status, evaluation of the comorbidity  burden, and renal function. Samples for central  immunophenotyping and FISH were assessed at the  reference laboratories (Department I for Internal  Medicine, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany and  the Department of Internal Medicine III, University of  Ulm, Germany, respectively). Patients with del(17p) as  detected by FISH were excluded. Patients had to have an  advanced clinical stage (Binet C) or confi rmed active  disease requiring treatment.9 Moreover, a low comorbidity  burden as defi ned by a Cumulative Illness Rating Scale  (CIRS)10 score up to 6, a normal creatinine clearance of at  least 70 mL/min, and an ECOG performance status of  0–2 were required for inclusion. ',\n"," 'Patients with impaired  renal function due to an abdominal lymph node mass  were eligible after central review. The main exclusion  criteria were impaired renal function other than that  caused by abdominal lymph node mass, CIRS score less  than 6, previous therapy for chronic lymphocytic  Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed between April 1, 2007, and Jan 31, 2008  for reports with the search terms “CLL”, and “clinical trial” and  “chemotherapy” and “antibody” without date or language  restrictions. Publications showed promising results for  chemoimmunotherapy regimens based on purine analogues  with or without CD20 antibodies or with the CD52 antibody  alemtuzumab. First data from the CLL8 study of the German CLL  Study Group presented at the American Society of Hematology  Meeting in December, 2007, showed the superiority of the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab regimen over  chemotherapy alone. On the other hand, all purine  analogue-based combinations were associated with toxic  eff ects. First data from a phase 2 trial evaluating bendamustine  and rituximab had favourable results with regard to toxic eff ects  and good effi cacy. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health  registry for clinical trials listed no clinical trials with a head-to- head comparison of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab with bendamustine and rituximab in chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia. Added value of this study The CLL10 study is the fi rst trial directly comparing  bendamustine-based chemoimmunotherapy with fl udarabine  and cyclophosphamide-based chemoimmunotherapy. The data  confi rm data from a meta-analysis suggesting the superiority  of fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide-based  chemoimmunotherapy over bendamustine-based  chemoimmunotherapy. Implications of all the available evidence In a head-to-head comparison bendamustine and rituximab is  less eff ective than the standard therapy, but can be considered  in patients older than 65 years with chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia. Higher incidence of adverse events observed with  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in patients  older than 65 years and good effi cacy with bendamustine and  rituximab in this group might support the use of  bendamustine and rituximab in fi t elderly patients. Moreover,  our data show that immunosuppressive eff ects are long  lasting with fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide-based  therapy.

All patients provided written informed consent  before central screening was begun. The study was done  according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Randomisation and masking After the central screening process, eligible patients  were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer- generated randomisation list (Institute for Medical  Statistics and Epidemiology, Technical University of  Munich, Germany). The randomisation was balanced by  the use of randomly permuted blocks with a block size  of eight and was stratifi ed according to participating  country and Binet stage at pre-therapeutic staging (A vs  B vs C). The assigned treatment group was provided to  the German CLL Study Group central study offi ce, and  the screening result together with the confi rmation of  patient randomisation, and allocation to treatment were  sent through the German CLL Study Group central  study offi ce to the investigators. Investigators and  patients were not masked to the treatment assignment. Procedures Within the two-group parallel design of this investigator- initiated trial, six cycles of rituximab-based chemo- immunotherapy with fl udarabine and cyclo phosphamide  were compared with six cycles of bendamustine and  rituximab. The standard treatment consisted of  six 28-day cycles of intravenous fl udarabine (25 mg/m²  per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m²  per day)  on the fi rst 3 days of each cycle. The treatment  with bendamustine (90 mg/m² per day) was given  intravenously on the fi rst 2 days of each of the six 28-day  cycles. Rituximab 375 mg/m² was given to both groups  intravenously on day 0 of cycle 1 and subsequently  during the next fi ve cycles rituximab 500 mg/m² was  given on day 1 of each cycle. According to the protocol,  prophylactic use of antibiotics or growth factors was  not generally recommended. In cases of severe  leukocytopenia with a duration of more than 7 days,  prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with  co-trimoxazole was recommended. ',\n"," 'In patients whose blood counts had not recovered  adequately within 28 days or still showed signs of an  active infection, the next treatment was postponed and  further cycles of therapy continued with a 25% dose  reduction. After two dose reductions to a total dose  reduction of 50%, treatment was stopped in case there  was any further treatment delay due to adverse events. Baseline disease assessment included physical  examination, ECOG performance status, and imaging  with CT scans or ultrasound. IGHV mutation status  was analysed by DNA sequencing at the reference  laboratory (Department of Internal Medicine III,  University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). During treatment,  blood counts (leucocytes, haemoglobin, thrombocytes,  and diff erential blood count of leucocytes) were  measured on a weekly basis, and serum chemistry  (creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, AST, and  ALT) at least once before the next treatment cycle. Response to treatment was classifi ed according to the  IWCLL response criteria.9 Radiographic imaging and  blood counts were done at fi nal restaging (ie, 3 months  after the beginning of the last treatment cycle). Response  and disease progression were assessed by the study  investigators and confi rmed by a central, investigator- independent medical review. Minimal residual disease  status was examined centrally in the reference laboratory  (Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital  of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany), as  previously described.11 For minimal residual disease  status samples of peripheral blood were assessed by  four-colour minimal residual disease status fl ow  cytometry with a sensitivity of at least 10–4 at study entry,  at interim staging, and for fi nal staging in all patients. Infections of any grade and all severe adverse events  were reported up to 5 years after treatment. Each adverse  event was reported with severity rated in accordance with  the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) criteria (version 3) grades. An interim assessment was done after three cycles of  treatment. Patients who achieved a complete response,  partial response, or stable disease, and in whom toxic  eff ects were acceptable, continued treatment for three  additional cycles. Patients with progressive disease  stopped treatment and were treated outside the study  protocol at the discretion of the treating physician. ',\n"," 'Patients with progressive disease were assessed as non- responders. An assessment of initial response was done  1 month (within 7 days) after the beginning of the last  cycle of treatment. The results were confi rmed 2 months  later by fi nal restaging, which had to be done in all  patients receiving at least two treatment cycles. Subsequently, patients completed follow-up examination  every 3 months for the fi rst 2 years and every 6 months  for the next 3 years. Thereafter, the disease status was  assessed annually. Measurement for the presence of  minimal residual disease cells in the bone marrow  during fi nal restaging was planned for all patients who  achieved a clinical complete remission at the initial  response assessment. For patients with clinical complete  response at fi nal restaging, a peripheral blood minimal  residual disease status analysis at 12 and 18 months after  fi nal restaging was done. Outcomes The primary objective of this study was to show non- inferiority of bendamustine and rituximab compared  with the standard treatment of fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab with regard to a  primary endpoint of progression-free survival, defi ned  as time from randomisation until progression or death  Articles 4 www.thelancet.com/oncology Published online May 20, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30051-1 from any cause. ',\n"," 'Progression was assessed by the  site investigators and had a systematic investigator- independent medical review based on the IWCLL  criteria (progression had to be centrally confi rmed  before being accepted).9 Secondary endpoints were:  overall survival (defi ned as time between randomisation  until death from any cause); the proportion of patients  who achieved an overall response (defi ned as proportion  of patients having achieved a complete remission,  complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery,  or partial remission as response to study treatment with  respect to the intention-to-treat population); minimal  residual disease status assessment; the proportion of  patients achieving a response in biologically defi ned  risk groups (according to age, sex, Binet stage, IGHV  status, and cytogenetic subgroup according to the  hierarchical model); safety; event-free survival (defi ned  as time from fi rst study treatment to date of the  beginning of a new treatment for any haematological  maliganancy, disease progression, or death from any  cause); duration of remission (defi ned as the time  between date of fi rst response until progression or  death from any cause); and quality of life assessment  using the EORTC-C30, including the fatigue module. Statistical analysis The primary endpoint of progression-free survival was  used to calculate the sample size of the study. The non- inferiority hypothesis of bendamustine and rituximab  compared with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab was tested by assessing whether the 90·4% CI  of the hazard ratio (HR) excluded a predefi ned  non-inferiority margin including the adjustment for  one interim analysis using the O’Brien and Fleming  method. Based on results from the CLL8 trial5 and the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab trial of the  MD Anderson Cancer Center2 it was assumed that  treatment with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab would lead to a 75·0% progression-free survival  at 2 years. We aimed to show that the 2-year progression- free survival with bendamustine and rituximab was not  67·5% or less with a corresponding non-inferiority  margin of 1·388 for the HR. 198 progression-free survival  events were required to have 80% power (alpha was  0·048, one sided). 511 patients needed to be enrolled with  these assumptions. Due to an expected drop-out rate of  10%, we aimed to recruit 550 patients. ',\n"," 'The interim  analysis was done after two-thirds (ie, 132) of the required  progression-free survival events. For the primary  endpoint analysis the HR including the 90·4% CI was  calculated with a multivariable Cox regression analysis  under the assumption of proportional hazards adjusted  for the stratifi cation factors Binet stage and country. In a  second step, a Cox proportional-hazards model with both  stepwise forward and backward selection procedures was  applied to progression-free survival, including treatment,  country, Binet stage, and other prognostic factors, such as  Figure 1: Trial profi le CLL=chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Further sensitivity  analyses were not done for the primary endpoint analysis. Time-to-event endpoints including 95% CIs were  estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and  survival curves were compared using two-sided non- stratifi ed log-rank tests. For comparison of the treatment  groups, Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s χ² test  (categorical variables) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test  (continuous variables) were used. Exploratory post hoc  subgroup analyses for progression-free survival and  response were done considering the factors age, Binet  stage, cytogenetic categories, IGHV mutation status,  and sex. Methods included two-sided non-stratifi ed log- rank tests and the calculation of HRs including 95% CIs. Additionally, the interaction with study treatment was  explored for each factor; a term for the interaction  between the factor and the study treatment was included  in a Cox regression model. Post hoc matched paired  analysis was done for IGHV mutation status and  progression-free survvial (appendix). All statistical tests were two-sided and a p value of less  than 0·05 was considered signifi cant. Adjustments for  multiple comparisons were not considered for analysing  secondary endpoints and exploratory subgroup analyses. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat  population. The results of minimal residual disease  status at follow-up were calculated based on the intention- to-treat population and based on those patients for whom  a sample at follow-up month 12 and month 18 was  available. Safety analyses were restricted to patients from the  intention-to-treat population who received at least one  dose of one component of the study treatment.

After central screening, 124 patients  were not eligible for trial participation. 564 patients  (aged 33–81 years) who met the inclusion criteria were  randomly assigned to the treatment groups (fi gure 1). Three patients were excluded immediately after allocation  due to major violation of the inclusion and exclusion  criteria resulting in 282 patients included in the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group  and 279 in the bendamustine and rituximab group  (the intention-to-treat population; fi gure 1). Both treatment  groups were well balanced with respect to disease stage,  median age, sex, time from initial diagnosis, physical  fi tness (CIRS, ECOG status), creatinine clearance,  presence of B-symptoms, serum concentration of  β2-microglobulin and thymidine kinase, and genomic  aberrations according to the hierarchical model and  detected by FISH (table 1). However, there was an  imbalance in the distribution of patients with unmutated  IGHV status with a higher proportion in the bendamustine  and rituximab group. Moreover, the proportion of patients  older than 70 years was higher in the bendamustine and  rituximab group than the fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab group. Among female patients there was an  imbalance in the distribuation of del(11q) between both  groups (triple combination, 21 [26%] of 81 had del(11q),  double combination, 11 [15%] of 72). The median follow-up  for the fl udarabine, cyclophos phamide, and rituximab  group was 37·4 months (IQR 31·7–46·4) and for the  bendamustine and rituximab group was 36·0 months  (30·6–44·7) (for all patients 37·1 months [IQR 31·0–45·5]). The median number of treatment cycles was  six (triple combination IQR 5–6, double combination 6–6)  for both groups (mean number for fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab 5·27 [SD 1·33], for  bendamustine and rituximab 5·41 [1·35]; p=0·02).  83 (29%) of 282 patients in the fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab group compared with  54 (19%) of 279 patients in the bendamustine and  rituximab group received less than the planned six cycles  of treatment (p=0·005).

Reasons for early treatment discontinuation in  the triple combination group were toxic eff ects in  26 patients, progressive disease in two patients, patient  decision for six patients, and three patients went off study  before start of treatment, and in the double combination  group, toxic eff ects in 24 patients, progressive disease in  two patients, patient decision for four patients, one patient  achieved a complete response, and one patient went off  study before start of treatment. For any of the three drugs a dose reduction of more  than 10% was done during at least one treatment cycle in  148 (52%) of 282 patients of the fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab group and in 145 (52%) of  279 patients of the bendamustine and rituximab group  (p=0·904). ',\n"," 'No signifi cant diff erence for dose reduction  was observed between the two age groups. Of the patients  aged 65 years or younger, 108 (55%) received at least one  cycle of a dose-reduced fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab regimen and 85 (50%) at least one cycle of  a dose-reduced bendamustine and rituximab regimen  (p=0·302). In patients older than 65 years, bendamustine  and rituximab was dose reduced in 60 (56%) patients  and fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in  40 (47%; p=0·211). Overall, a signifi cantly higher  proportion of treatment cycles with bendamustine and  rituximab were dose reduced by more than 10% (423 [28%]  of 1510 cycles) than with fl udarabine, cyclo phosphamide,  and rituximab (363 [24%] of 1487 cycles; p=0·025). No diff erences in dose reductions were observed between  male and female patients in the fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group (41 [51%] of  81 female patients and 107 [53%] of 201 male patients;  p=0·69) or the bendamustine and rituximab groups  (34 [47%] of 72 female patients and 111 (54%) of 207 male  patients; p=0·35). Progression-free survival was signifi cantly shorter for  bendamustine and rituximab in comparison with  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (median  41·7 months [95% CI 34·9–45·3] vs 55·2 months [not  evaluable], HR 1·643 [90·4% CI 1·308–2·064] p=0·0003;  fi gure 2). As the upper limit of the 90·4% CI was greater  than 1·388 the null hypothesis for the corresponding non- inferiority hypothesis was not rejected. Treatment with  bendamustine and rituximab, elevated serum thymidine  kinase, del(11q), and unmutated IGHV status were  independently associated with a higher risk of progression  in multivariate analysis (table 2). The results of the  univariate analysis are in the appendix. In younger patients (≤65 years) median progression- free survival was signifi cantly longer with the triple  combination (53·6 months [95% CI not evaluable]) than  with the double combination (38·5 months [33·1–44·8],  p=0·0004; fi gures 2, 3). There was no signifi cant  diff erence in progression-free survival in elderly  (>65 years) patients in the fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab treated group compared with the  bendamustine and rituximab group (median not reached  [95% CI not evaluable] vs 48·5 months [34·6–52·0];  p=0·172; fi gure 2). ',\n"," 'There was no signifi cant interaction  between study treatment and age (p=0·413). Post-hoc  assessment of progression-free survival according to  IGHV status showed a median time to progression of  42·7 months (95% CI 36·2–55·2) in the fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab therapy group versus  33·6 months (30·3–38·4) in the bendamustine and  rituximab group for patients with unmutated IGHV  status (p=0·017; fi gures 2, 3).

Post-hoc  subgroup analysis according to sex showed no diff erence  in progression-free survival between treatment groups  for women (fi gure 3). In female patients median  progression-free survival was 51·5 months (95% CI not  evaluable) with the triple combination therapy and  52·0 months (not evaluable) with the bendamustine and  rituximab therapy (p=0·916), by contrast with male  patients, in whom progression-free survival was not  reached (95% CI not evaluable) versus 35·3 months  (33·5–42·6, p<0·0001; fi gure 3, appendix). Moreover,  there was a signifi cant interaction between study  treatment and sex (p=0·034). Post-hoc anlaysis showed  that fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  treatment resulted in a signifi cantly longer progression- free survival in the genetic subgroup of patients with  del(11q) (37·8 months [95% CI 31·5–45·5] vs 25·3 months  [23·5–30·3], p=0·0002; fi gure 3). In all other genetic  subgroups the diff erence in progression-free survival  was not signifi cant and did not have any interactions  with study treatment (fi gure 3, appendix).

Signifi cantly more patients treated with  the triple combination had negative minimal residual  disease (137 [49%, 74% referring to available samples  only]) in comparison with patients treated with  bendamustine and rituximab (107 [38%, 63% referring  to available samples only]; p=0·041, and p=0·029 for  available samples, respectively). ',\n"," 'Bone marrow samples  were evaluated in 129 (46%) patients after fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab treatment and  98 (35%) patients after bendamustine and rituximab  treatment. Negative minimal residual disease in bone  marrow was achieved in 75 patients (27%, 58% referring  to available samples only) after fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab and 31 patients (11%, 32%  referring to available samples only; both comparisons  p<0·0001) after bendamustine and rituximab. During  follow-up at month 12, 80 patients (67 patients at month  18) after fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  therapy and 78 patients (59 patients at month 18) after  bendamustine and rituximab therapy were assessed for  minimal residual disease in peripheral blood. Minimal  residual disease was not detected in a signifi cantly  higher proportion of patients treated with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab compared with those  treated with bendamustine and rituximab after  12 months (referring to available samples 47 [59%] vs  20 [26%], p<0·0001; referring to all patients 17% vs 7%,  p=0·0001) and after 18 months (37 [55%] vs 16 [27%],  p=0·002; 13% vs 6%, p=0·005, respectively). No diff erence in overall survival was observed between  treatment groups. After 3 years, 91% (95% CI 87·0–94·2)  of the patients treated with fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab and 92% [88·7–95·6] of  those treated with bendamustine and rituximab were  still alive (HR 1·034 [95% CI 0·620–1·724], p=0·897;  fi gure 4). 30 patients assigned to triple combination  therapy and 29 patients assigned to bendamustine and  rituximab therapy had died as of January, 2014. In most  patients, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was the  cause of death (ten [33%] of 30 with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab and 12 [41%] of  29 with bendamustine and rituximab). Secondary  cancers (seven [23%] with fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab and fi ve [17%] with  bendamustine and rituximab) were the second most  frequent cause followed by death due to other  diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (fi ve [17%]  with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  and seven [24%] with bendamustine and rituximab). ',\n"," 'Other causes of death included: in the fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group, one liver  failure due to cirrhosis, one death due to graft-versus- host disease, one death due to intra-abdominal bleeding  with anticoagulants, one death with no autopsy  performed; and in the bendamustine and rituximab  group, one lung embolism. Due to the low number of  deaths, subgroup analyses were not done. Event-free survival analysis and duration of response  data are shown in the appendix. Duration of response was  signifi cantly longer with the triple combination than with  the double combination (52·7 months [95% CI not  evaluable] vs 38·9 months [34·2–43·6]; HR 1·657  [95% CI 1·256–2·185]; p=0·001). Median event- free survival was 55·2 months (95% CI not evaluable) with  the triple combination and 38·5 months (32·4–44·6)  with bendamustine and rituximab (HR 1·626  [95% CI 1·255–2·108]; p=0·001). As of data cutoff , 12 (4%)  patients in the fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab group and 18 (6%) patients in the bendamustine  and rituximab group only have received treatment for  relapse (appendix). Four patients from each group had an  allogeneic stem cell transplant. All 557 patients who received at least one dose of study  treatment were included in the safety analysis. Severe,  CTCAE grade 3 and 4, adverse events occurred more  frequently in the fl udarabine, cyclo phosphamide, and  rituximab group compared with the bendamustine and  rituximab group (table 4). Neutropenia, leukocytopenia,  thrombocytopenia, and the incidence of severe infec- tions were more frequent with the triple combination  therapy.

(Blood.2016;127(2):208-215) Introduction Currently,thereremainsageneralconsensusthatnocurativetreatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exists with the exception of allogeneicstemcelltransplantation. Chemoimmunotherapyachieves disease control and survival prolongation and is therefore the current standardtreatmentinpatientswithpreviouslyuntreatedCLL. 2-5 Inthe last 5 years, 2 new drugs, ibrutinib and idelalisib, targeting B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, have been studied and approved. They are less toxic in the short term than chemotherapeutic agents and yielded promisingresponsesinpatientswithrelapsed/refractoryCLLincluding those with a TP53 aberration. 6-11 Furthermore, the selective BCL-2 inhibitorvenetoclaxiscurrentlybeinginvestigatedinongoingclinical trials. Given these results, it is likely that the place of first-line chemoimmunotherapy may be challenged in the future. ',\n"," 'Importantly, the experience with these new drugs remains limited, and the current treatment model requires continuous indefinite treatment. Moreover,thereisalackofprospective,controlledtrialswiththese agents in the first-line setting. Additionally, although the out- come following chemoimmunotherapy may be highly variable, important subgroups of patients show an excellent outcome, cor- roboratingitsuseasstandardfirst-linetherapy.Ontheotherhand, secondary malignancies are one of the most concerning unwanted effects following chemoimmunotherapy, and the true long-term incidence needs to be better defined.

On the basis of these findings, FCR has becomethestandardtherapyforphysicallyfitpatientswithpreviously untreated CLL. In this report, we present the results of an extended observation time with a median follow-up of 5.9 years of the randomized phase 3 CLL8 trial of the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), with particular emphasis on long-term follow-up for survival and adverse events. Methods Study design Thestudydesign hasbeenreportedpreviously. Inshort, the CLL8trialwasa prospective, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study conducted at 190 centers across11countries.TheInstitutionalReviewBoardand/orethicscommitteeof each institution approved the study protocol. Each patient provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Study treatment consisted of 6 courses (28days/course)ofintravenousF(25mg/m perday)andC(250mg/m perday) for the first 3 days of each treatment course, with or without the addition of rituximab. Rituximab (Mabthera/Rituxan; F.

Methods Treatment-naive, physically fi t patients (aged 30–81 years) with CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fl udarabine (25 mg/m2 per day)  and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2 per day) for the fi rst 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without  rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 0 of fi rst course, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of second to sixth courses) in 190 centres in  11 countries. Investigators and patients were not masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The  primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00281918. Findings 408 patients were assigned to fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy group)  and 409 to fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy group); all patients were analysed. At 3 years after  randomisation, 65% of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were free of progression compared with 45% in  the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·56 [95% CI 0·46–0·69], p<0·0001); 87% were alive versus 83%, respectively  (0·67 [0·48–0·92]; p=0·01). Chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia  (136 [34%] of 404 vs 83 [21%] of 396; p<0·0001) and leucocytopenia (97 [24%] vs 48 [12%]; p<0·0001). Other side- eff ects, including severe infections, were not increased. There were eight (2%) treatment-related deaths in the  chemoimmunotherapy group compared with ten (3%) in the chemotherapy group. Interpretation Chemoimmunotherapy with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab improves progression- free survival and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Moreover, the results suggest that  the choice of a specifi c fi rst-line treatment changes the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Funding F Hoff mann-La Roche. Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common  adult lymphoid malignant disease in western countries,  aff ecting about fi ve in 100 000 of the population per  year.1,2 Its clinical course is highly variable and can be  predicted by use of various criteria,3 including clinical  staging,4,5 chromosomal abnormalities,6 or mutations  of the immunoglobulin heavy variable chain  (IGHV) gene.7,8 For more than 40 years, chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia has been treated with various chemotherapies. ',\n"," 'Chlorambucil, an alkylating drug, was the main drug  for three decades.9,10 Combinations of alkylating drugs  with vinca alkaloids or anthracycline drugs did not  improve outcomes.11 In the 1990s, purine analogues  were a new class of drugs that were active against  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.12,13 In the past decade,  the combination of purine analogues with alkylating  drugs, particularly fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide,  improved the rates of clinical response, complete  remission, and progression-free survival (PFS).14–16 Until  now, however, none of these drug combinations have  shown an improvement in overall survival in  clinical studies. Chemoimmunotherapy—the addition of monoclonal  antibodies to chemotherapy—was created for the  treatment of indolent and aggressive lymphoma. ',\n"," 'Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed  against the CD20 antigen,17 became the standard drug  for use with chemotherapy for various B-cell  lymphomas.18,19 In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,  however, the low expression of the CD20 antigen on  leukaemic cells,20,21 and poor response rates with  standard-dose rituximab led to the initial expectation  that rituximab might not generate suffi cient clinical  benefi t in this disease.22 However, higher doses of  Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 376 October 2, 2010 1165 and University of Melbourne,  Melbourne, VIC, Australia  (Prof J F Seymour MD);  Haematology Institute, Kaplan  Medical Centre, Rehovot, Israel  (Prof A Berrebi MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine I, Division of  Haematology and  Haemostaseology, Medical  University of Vienna, Vienna,  Austria (Prof U Jäger MD);  Service des Maladies du Sang,  Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille,  France (B Cazin MD); First  Department of Medicine,  Charles University General  Hospital, Prague, Czech  Republic (M Trneny MD); Klinik  für Hämatologie und  Onkologie, St Antonius  Hospital, Eschweiler, Germany  (P Staib MD); Department of  Internal Medicine III, University  of Ulm, Ulm, Germany  (A Bühler MD, D Winkler MD,  T Zenz MD, Prof H Döhner MD,  Prof S Stilgenbauer MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine II, University Hospital  of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus  Kiel, Kiel, Germany  (S Böttcher MD, M Ritgen MD,  Prof M Kneba MD); and  rituximab used alone improved response rates.23  Moreover, the results of phase 2 trials suggested that  rituximab in combination with chemotherapy might  have additive or synergistic eff ects in pretreated and  treatment-naive patients.24–28 In these trials, the standard  dose of rituximab (375 mg/m2 per day) was increased to  500 mg/m2 per day.24 In a study of 300 treatment-naive  patients, the combination of fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab resulted in an overall  response rate of 95%, with 72% of patients achieving a  complete response.24,28 These response rates were among  the highest reported so far for fi rst-line treatments in  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. ',\n"," 'On the  basis of these promising results, the German Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukaemia Study Group initiated a phase 3  study to compare the effi cacy and safety of fl udarabine  and cyclophosphamide with fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab as fi rst-line treatment in  patients with advanced, symptomatic chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods Study design and patients A prospective, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study  was done in 190 centres in 11 countries. Treatment-naive  patients (aged 30–81 years) diagnosed with  immunophenotypically confi rmed chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia in Binet stage C,4 or with confi rmed active  disease in Binet stages A or B29 were enrolled  (webappendix p 1). Additional inclusion criteria were an  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)  performance status of 0–1 and a low comorbidity, which  was defi ned as a cumulative illness rating scale30 of up  to 6, and a creatinine clearance of at least 1·17 mL/s  (webappendix p 1). The main exclusion criteria were the  absence of active disease in patients with Binet stage A  or B, and the presence of clinically apparent autoimmune  cytopenia or active second disease. The institutional review board or ethics committee of  each institution approved the study protocol. Each  patient provided written informed consent before  enrolment. Randomisation and masking After informed consent was obtained from the patients,  investigators faxed the required registration sheets to  the central study offi ce in Cologne, Germany. Patients  were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio in a block  size of four to receive fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide  (chemotherapy) or fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy) up to July 27, 2004,  stratifi ed by centre, and then by country and Binet stage  since the fi rst amendment (July 27, 2004), using a  randomisation list that was computer generated at the  Institute for Medical Statistics and Epidemiology,  Technical University of Munich, Germany. Confi rmation  of patient randomisation and allocation to treatment  group was sent through the Central Study Offi ce in  Cologne, Germany, to the investigators. Patients were  enrolled by the investigators, and assignment to  treatment was done centrally at the Institute for Medical  Statistics and Epidemiology, Technical University of  Munich. Thus, patient allocation was done independently  of the study investigators. ',\n"," 'Investigators and patients  were not masked to the treatment assignment. Procedures Treatment consisted of six 28-day courses of intravenous  fl udarabine (25 mg/m2 per day) and cyclophosphamide  (250 mg/m2 per day) for the fi rst 3 days of each treatment  course, with or without rituximab (Mabthera or Rituxan,  Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on day 0 of the fi rst course, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of  the second to sixth courses. Prophylaxis with antiviral  drugs or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor were not  recommended in this study (webappendix p 1). Prophylaxis of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis  jirovecii was recommended for severe leucocytopenia  that lasted for more than 7 days. An interim response assessment was done after three  courses of treatment. Patients who achieved at least a  partial response or complete remission continued  treatment as planned in the protocol.

Subsequently, patients  completed follow-up examinations every 3 months for  the following years 1–3, every 6 months for years 4–5,  and every year up to year 8. Assessments of clinical disease were completed at  baseline, including assessments of tumour, cumulative  illness rating scale, ECOG performance status, and  immunophenotyping of circulating lymphocytes. ',\n"," 'Analyses of genomic aberrations by use of fl uorescent  in-situ hybridisation (FISH),6 and IGHV mutation  status7,8 by use of DNA sequencing were done in the  central reference laboratory (Ulm, Germany). Response to treatment and disease progression were  classifi ed according to the National Cancer Institute’s  working group criteria of 1996.29 Responses and disease  progression were assessed by the study investigators  and verifi ed by a central, investigator-independent  medical review. Adverse events and serious adverse  events were documented according to the Common  Toxicity Criteria (version 2). In January, 2008, the preplanned interim analysis  showed a signifi cant diff erence in the primary effi cacy  analysis (PFS) in favour of the group assigned to  chemoimmunotherapy. Since the signifi cance exceeded  the threshold for early closure, the study was formally  ended after a recommendation by the data safety  monitoring board. At this point, all patients had been  enrolled and completed treatment. Statistical analysis The primary endpoint was PFS, defi ned as the time  between randomisation and the date of fi rst documented  disease progression or death from any cause. Secondary  endpoints were event-free survival; overall survival;  disease-free survival; duration of remission; time to new  treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or death;  rates of molecular, complete, and partial remission;  response rates and survival times in biological subgroups;  rates of treatment-related adverse eff ects; pharmaco- economic eff ect; and quality of life. PFS and results of  safety and the major secondary endpoints (overall survival  and response rates) for the entire study cohort and  biological subgroups are reported here (fi gure 1). The planned sample size was calculated on the basis  of the primary endpoint, PFS. Data that were reported  before the initiation of the study indicated that the  median PFS was expected to be 40 months in the  chemotherapy group (corresponding to a 66% PFS rate  at 2 years), and 54 months in the chemoimmunotherapy  group (corresponding to a 74% PFS rate at 2 years).15 the assumption that the hazard ratio (HR) was 0·741,  using a two-sided log-rank test at the 5% level with a  power of 80%, and accounting for one interim analysis,  a minimum of 357 events were required.

To confi rm the primary analysis, a two-sided  log-rank test stratifi ed by Binet stage was done before  treatment. Exploratory analyses for the secondary  endpoints were done with two-sided stratifi ed and non- stratifi ed log-rank tests for time-to-event outcomes,  Fisher’s exact test and χ2 test for categorical variables,  and Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables.

Role of the funding source This trial was planned and initiated in 2003 as an  investigator-initiated trial by the German Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukaemia Study Group. Since 2004,  F Hoff mann-La Roche assumed the sponsorship for this  trial, because it intended to use the trial for the approval  of rituximab at regulatory agencies. The sponsor was  subsequently involved in the fi rst and second  amendments of the study protocol. The sponsor of the  study was responsible for data gathering, and shared  responsibility for medical review of the data with the  corresponding author. The corresponding author was  responsible for data analysis, data interpretation, writing  of the report, had full access to all the data in the study,  and had the fi nal responsibility for the decision to  submit for publication. Results Previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia were enrolled between July, 2003, and March,  2006. Figure 1 shows the trial profi le. Patients were  randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with  fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide, or chemo- immunotherapy with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab. Both groups were well balanced with  respect to age, sex, disease stage, physical fi tness  (cumulative illness rating scale, ECOG), creatinine  clearance, serum concentrations of β2 microglobulin  and thymidine kinase, genomic aberrations, and IGHV  mutational status (table 1). Patients in the chemotherapy  group had B symptoms more often than did those in the  chemoimmunotherapy group. Genomic profi ling data  (FISH and IGHV mutational status) were available for  624 (76%) patients.

These dose reductions were mostly because of treatment- related haematological toxicity, particularly neutropenia  and leucocytopenia (117 [62%] of 189 patients in the  chemoimmunotherapy group vs 69 [64%] of 108 in the  chemotherapy group; webappendix p 2). Signifi cantly more patients were in complete  remission in the chemoimmunotherapy group than in  the chemotherapy group (table 2). More patients  responded to treatment and more achieved a complete  remission in all Binet stages (table 2). The proportion of  patients who did not respond to treatment was lower in  the chemoimmunotherapy group than in the  chemotherapy group (39 [10%] vs 81 [20%]; p<0·0001). PFS was longer in the chemoimmunotherapy group  than in the chemotherapy group (median 51·8 months  [95% CI 46·2–57·6] vs 32·8 months [29·6–36·0];  p<0·0001; fi gure 2A). At 3 years after randomisation,  more patients remained progression free in the  chemoimmunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy  group (fi gure 2A; table 3). The risk of progression was  reduced by 44% in the chemoimmunotherapy group  compared with the chemotherapy group (HR 0·56  [95% CI 0·46–0·69]). An improvement in PFS was  noted in all stages. Patients with disease in Binet stages  B and C showed similar median PFS of 32·5 months  (28·4–36·6) and 33·0 months (25·0–41·2), respectively,  when treated with chemotherapy (fi gure 2B). Treatment  with chemoimmunotherapy improved the median PFS  to 51·8 months (47·8–56·0) in 522 patients with Binet  stage B disease (HR 0·50 [95% CI 0·39–0·65]; p<0·0001)  and to 40·7 months (0·73 [0·51–1·04]; p=0·081) in  252 patients with Binet stage C disease (fi gure 2B).

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab also  resulted in a signifi cant benefi t with respect to overall  survival. More deaths were noted after treatment with  fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide (86 [21%] of 409)  than after treatment with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab (65 [16%] of 408). In most cases, the  underlying cause of death was progressive disease  (chemotherapy 48 [56%] of 86, chemoimmunotherapy  33 [51%] of 65). ',\n"," 'Other fatal events were secondary  cancers (chemotherapy 13 [15%], chemoimmunotherapy  fi ve [8%]) and causes unrelated to chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia, such as myocardial infarction (15 [17%] and  17 [26%], respectively). At 3 years after randomisation,  more patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were  alive than in the chemotherapy group (table 4). The time  to 25% of patients dying was 62·5 months in the  chemoimmunotherapy group and 46·8 months in the  chemotherapy group (p=0·012; fi gure 3A). The risk of  death was reduced by 33% in the chemoimmunotherapy  group (n=355) compared with the chemotherapy group  (HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·48–0·92], p=0·012). The benefi t of chemoimmunotherapy was noted in  patients younger than 65 years and in those 65 years or  older with respect to the response rates and time to  progression, but not survival time (tables 2–4). Moreover,  in Cox regression analyses, age was not an independent  predictor of PFS or overall survival (table 5). Analyses of  secondary endpoints such as event-free survival, duration  of remission, and time to new treatment confi rmed  the clinical benefi t with chemoimmunotherapy  (webappendix p 1). More patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group had  a complete remission in most genetic subgroups as  defi ned by use of the hierarchical model,6 except for  patients with del(17p) or with no abnormalities (table 2). In patients with del(11q), trisomy 12, and unmutated  IGHV, chemoimmunotherapy improved rates of  complete remission by 3·5, 3·7, and 2·2 times,  respectively (table 2). At 3 years after randomisation, 76%  of 268 patients who achieved a complete remission  remained progression free compared with 45% of 549  who achieved only a partial response or a non-response  (p<0·0001); 95% of 268 patients who achieved complete  remission were alive compared with 82% of 549 who  achieved a partial response or non-response (p<0·0001). Chemoimmunotherapy resulted in signifi cantly higher  PFS in most genetic subgroups, including del(17p),  del(11q), del(13q), and trisomy 12 (table 3). The del(17p)  subgroup had the shortest median PFS (chemo- immunotherapy 11·3 months [range 10·3–12·2] vs  chemotherapy 6·5 months [0·8–12·2]; HR 0·47 [95% CI  0·24–0·90]; p=0·019). An unmutated IGHV was  predictive of a shorter PFS (table 5). ',\n"," 'Chemo- immunotherapy also improved overall survival in most  subgroups of patients, including Binet stages A and B  (but not stage C), del(13q), del(11q), and unmutated  IGHV (table 4). Del(17p), chemotherapy, unmutated IGHV status,  β2 microglobulin serum concentrations of at least  3·5 mg/L, and white blood cell count of 50×109 per L  were predictive of a reduced PFS (table 5). Variables that  were predictive of a reduced overall survival were  treatment with chemotherapy, del(17p), β2 microglobulin  serum concentrations of at least 3·5 mg/L, serum  thymidine kinase concentration of at least 10 U/L, and an  ECOG performance status of at least 1. The presence of del(17p) was the strongest negative  prognostic indicator of PFS and overall survival (table 5). Patients with this genetic abnormality showed a  signifi cantly shorter overall survival than did those in all  the other cytogenetic subgroups (p<0·0001), irrespective  of the treatment given (fi gure 3B and C). Preliminary  data about secondline treatment in patients with del(17p)  are described in the webappendix p 3. All patients who were given at least one dose of at least  one of the study drugs were included in the safety analysis. The total number of patients who had at least one grade 3  or 4 event during treatment was higher in the  chemoimmunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy  group (table 6). The frequency of side-eff ects  (eg, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, infections, tumour lysis  syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome) was not  signifi cantly diff erent in the two groups, with the exception  of neutropenia and leucocytopenia, which occurred more  often in the chemoimmunotherapy group (table 6).

More patients who were 65 years  or older than those who were younger than 65 years had  adverse events (table 6). Haematological toxicity was more  frequent in patients 65 years or older who were treated  with chemoimmunotherapy, without any increase of the  total rate of infections. Bacterial infections occurred more  frequently in patients 65 years or older than in younger  patients (table 6). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was administered  in 86 treatment cycles, for a median of 7 days in the  chemotherapy group and 6 days in the  chemoimmunotherapy group. It was given more  frequently in the chemoimmunotherapy group (n=75 vs  n=11). In 40 treatment cycles, granulocyte-colony  stimulating factor was given as prophylaxis without any  sign of neutropenia; in 46 cycles, it was administered to  treat an adverse event (neutropenia or leucocytopenia). Ten (3%) deaths were related to treatment in the  chemotherapy group, and eight (2%) in the chemo- immunotherapy group. Of these, six chemotherapy- treated patients and fi ve chemo immunotherapy-treated  patients died from infections (septicaemia [n=6],  pneumonia [n=3], hepatitis B [n=1], and cryptosporidium  gastroenteritis [n=1]). ',\n"," 'In seven patients (three in the  chemotherapy group and four in the chemo- immunotherapy group), death occurred before the third  treatment course (fatal septicaemia [n=6], sudden cardiac  death [n=1]). Discussion The combination of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab substantially increased the proportions of  patients achieving a complete remission and remaining  free of progression for 3 years. Most importantly, this  treatment also increased the likelihood of patients  surviving 3 years or more after randomisation (table 4)  and was an independent prognostic factor for overall  survival in the multivariate analysis. This result is  unexpected, because treatment of an indolent disease of  recurrent nature such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  was not thought to require an effi cient fi rst-line treatment. Why was a survival benefi t not reported in previous trials  of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia? First,  our trial is one of the largest done so far for fi rst-line  treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Therefore,  the statistical power needed to show eff ects on survival  might not have been achieved in some of the previous  studies. Second, the addition of the monoclonal antibody  rituximab to chemotherapy was shown to be more  eff ective for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  than was initially expected. Improvements in PFS and overall survival were much  greater in Binet stages A or B than in stage C, although  chemoimmunotherapy also resulted in signifi cantly  higher rates of complete remission in patients with  Binet stage C disease (table 2). This smaller benefi t in  Binet stage C might be attributable to a combined  imbalance of unfavourable prognostic factors. Since  dose reductions for prevention of haematological  toxicity needed to be maintained for the rest of the  treatment according to the protocol recommendations,  we believe that dose reductions required during early  courses of chemoimmunotherapy led to persistently  lower doses of all three drugs in patients with Binet  stage C disease. B symptoms and trisomy 12 were present slightly  more often in the chemotherapy group. To test for  potentially relevant imbalances in the study, both these  variables were included as potential covariates in the  Cox proportional hazard model.

With the exception of neutropenia and leucocytopenia,  the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, including  severe or opportunistic infections, was not increased  with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Initial reports about the use of rituximab in patients  with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had stressed the  possibility of early infusion reactions, cytokine release  syndromes, or tumour cell agglutination.32,33 However,  these side-eff ects did not arise often (<1%) in this trial. ',\n"," 'Moreover, patients older than 65 years with good  physical fi tness (defi ned by use of the cumulative illness  rating scale30 and creatinine clearance) tolerated both  treatment regimens quite well, and showed improved  outcome and survival time that were similar to those in  patients younger than 65 years (tables 2 and 4). However,  the patients’ median age of 61 years was much younger  than that of the average population of patients with  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (with a median age at  disease onset of about 70 years). Therefore, the  population in this trial represents a selection of fairly  young and physically fi t patients.

What remains to be established  is how patients given fi rst-line fl udarabine and  cyclophosphamide, or fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab will fare with second-line treatments. Data are being gathered to create a database to address  this important question. The analysis of various clinical and genetic variables  showed that the presence of del(17p) was the strongest  negative prognostic factor. Del(17p) is associated with a  dysfunction of the p53 tumour suppressor34 and a very  poor outcome after fl udarabine-based chemo- therapies.34,35 In our trial, the negative prognostic eff ect  of del(17p) was not abrogated with chemoimmuno- therapy. By contrast, the rate of complete remission in  patients with del(11q), an aberration previously  associated with a poor prognosis,36 was increased by  more than three times with chemoimmunotherapy  (table 2). ',\n"," 'Our results corroborate the results of a report  showing that this treatment might overcome the adverse  prognostic signifi cance of del(11q).37 Additional  subgroups that benefi ted greatly from treatment with  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were  patients with trisomy 12 and del(13q) (table 2). These results suggest that a molecularly guided  treatment approach could be useful for patients with  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; those with del(17p) might  not benefi t substantially from chemo immunotherapy  with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Therefore, allogeneic stem cell trans plantation should be  off ered to patients with del(17p) who are physically fi t, if  they achieve a remission with treatments such as the  chemoimmunotherapy we used, alemtuzumab, or similar  treatments.38–40 By contrast, the combination of fl udarabine,  cyclopho sphamide, and rituximab seems an excellent  treatment choice for patients with del(11q), trisomy 12, or  del(13q). The results of this trial lend support to the  recommendation that molecular genetics (FISH) should  be used to guide treatment of patients with chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia.41 Our fi ndings show that the combination of fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as fi rst-line  chemoimmunotherapy improves the outcome of physically  fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The  fi ndings of this randomised trial show an improvement of  overall survival after a specifi c fi rst-line treatment for  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These  results might help establish a new treatment model in  which the choice of a specifi c fi rst-line treatment improves  the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

In contrast, TP53 defects are not associated with resistance to the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab or methyl- prednisolone. In an attempt to improve the treatment of TP53-defective CLL, a multicenter phase II study was developed to evaluate alemtuzumab and methylprednisolone in combination. ',\n"," 'Patients and Methods Thirty-nine patients with TP53-deleted CLL (17 untreated and 22 previously treated) received up to 16 weeks of treatment with alemtuzumab 30 mg three times a week and methylprednisolone 1.0 g/m for five consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of cotrimoxa- zole, itraconazole, and aciclovir (or valganciclovir for asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia). The primary end point was response as assigned by an end-point review committee. Secondary end points were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results The overall response rate, complete response rate (including with incomplete marrow recovery), median PFS, and median OS were 85%, 36%, 11.8 months, and 23.5 months, respectively, in the entire cohort and 88%, 65%, 18.3 months, and 38.9 months, respectively, in previously untreated patients. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic and glucocorticoid-associated toxicity occurred in 67% and 23% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 infection occurred in 51% of the overall cohort and in 29% of patients less than 60 years of age. Treatment-related mortality was 5%. Conclusion Alemtuzumab plus methypredisolone is the most effective induction regimen hitherto reported in TP53-deleted CLL. The risk of infection is age related and, in younger patients, seems only marginally higher than that associated with rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide.

The disease runs a chronic relapsing course that requires multiple treatment episodes and is notable for its clinical diversity. Among the many biologic variables that correlate with clinical outcome, dele- tion of TP53 on chromosome 17p (17p ) is associ- ated with the worst prognosis. TP53 encodes the p53 protein, which is a tran- scription factor that is activated by DNA damage and coordinates the response to such damage by inducing the expression of genes that induce apo- ptosis or cell-cycle arrest or facilitate DNA repair. TP53 is the most frequently inactivated gene in hu- man cancer. In CLL, TP53 defects are found in approximately 10% to 15% of patients requiring frontline therapy 6-8 and almost 50% of patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease.

All rights reserved. one TP53 allele and mutation of the other, although in a minority of patients, the TP53 defect is monoallelic. 6-13 TP53 defects in CLL are strongly associated with low complete response (CR) rates after various chemotherapy regimens including chlorambucil, fludara- bine, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC), and FC plus mitoxantrone. 6-8,14-16 TP53 defects are also associated with a poor response to chemotherapy-based combinations that contain the anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R). Such regimens include R plus fludarabine, R plus FC (R-FC), R-FC plus mitoxantrone, R plus bendamustine, and R in combination with pentostatin and cyclophos- phamide. 17-21 These observations are entirely in keeping with the established importance of the wild-type p53 protein in mediating the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents including purine analogs. 22-24 Alemtuzumab is a humanized rat monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52, which is an antigen expressed on malignant and nonmalignant lymphocytes including CLL cells. 25,26 Alemtuzumab has useful therapeu- ticactivityinCLL 27-31 and,incontrasttochemotherapy,isnolesseffective in patients with TP53 defects. 14,32-34 However, in previously treated pa- tients with TP53 defects, alemtuzumab produced overall response (OR) rates of only 33% to 55%, with few CRs and a median PFS of only 4.7 to 7.7 months. 32-34 Similarly, the median PFS after frontline alem- tuzumab in patients with TP53 defects was only 11 months. We speculated that the effectiveness of alemtuzumab might be enhanced by combining it with a glucocorticoid (GC). Our hy- pothesis was based on 3 considerations. First, in keeping with the p53-independent action of GCs, 23,24 high-dose methylpred- nisolone (HDMP) has established activity in TP53-defective CLL. Second, alemtuzumab preferentially targets the blood and bone marrow, whereas GCs are particularly effective at reducing lymphadenopathy. Third, GC treatment may redistribute CLL cells from tissues into the bloodstream where they should be more susceptible to killing by alemtuzumab. The feasibility of combining alemtuzumab with methylprednisolone was illustrated by a small ret- rospective study in which three of five patients with TP53-defective CLL achieved a CR. In this article, we present the results of a pro- spective multicenter phase II clinical trial to formally evaluate the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab plus methylprednisolone in pa- tients with CLL and deletion of TP53. ',\n"," 'PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Design The study was designed as a single-arm, open-label trial with the primary purpose of detecting an OR rate of at least 20%. This was the expected response rate in patients with previously untreated 17p CLL after chlorambucil or fludarabine monotherapy (the standard of care in the United Kingdom when the trial was designed). Patients The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by a multicenter research ethics committee before recruitment. Patients were eligible for the study if they met all of the following criteria: were at least 18 years old, had a diagnosis of CLL that required treatment according to National Cancer Institute guidelines; had a TP53 deletion (17p ) detected by FISH in at least 20% of CLL cells, and had a WHO performance status of 0 to 2. Both untreated and previously treated patients were eligible for the study. Patients were excluded if they had severe cytopenias that were not due to CLL, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or hypertension, active peptic ulcer disease, severe renal or hepatic impairment, or any other severe medical disorder. Treatment Schedule Treatment consisted of administration of alemtuzumab three times a week for 16 weeks in combination with methylprednisolone 1.0 g/m /d for 5 consecutive days, which was repeated every 28 days for 4 cycles. Alemtuzumab was given via the intravenous route for the first 4 weeks and via the subcuta- neous route thereafter. 31,34 At the start of treatment, alemtuzumab was in- creased on successive doses from 3 to 10 mg to a final dose of 30 mg if the previous dose was well tolerated. Premedication consisted of paracetamol, chlorphenamine, and, if required, hydrocortisone. Patients received allopuri- nol, lansoprazole, and antimicrobial prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole 960 mg twiceperdaythreetimesaweek,aciclovir400mgfourtimesperday,anditracona- zole suspension 200 mg twice per day. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and ciprofloxacin were administered whenever the neutrophil count fell below 1.0  /L. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed every week. Patients with CMV viremia received oral valganciclovir instead of aciclovir. In the event of CMV reactivation associated with symptoms or end-organ damage, patients received intravenous ganciclovir, and the study treatment was interrupted until recovery. The study treatment was also inter- rupted in the event of grade 3 or 4 infection or grade 4 hematologic toxicity and discontinued in the event of disease progression. Assessments The primary end point was response. ',\n"," 'Secondary end points were safety, PFS, and overall survival (OS). Assessment of response and disease progression was based on the updated National Cancer Institute Working Group Guide- lines and included computed tomography scanning and analysis of bone marrow for minimal residual disease (MRD) by using multicolor flow cytom- etry (sensitivity 10 Full assessments were performed after 8 weeks, at completion of therapy, and at 6-month intervals thereafter until disease pro- gression. The final response of each patient after completion of therapy was assigned by an end-point review committee that consisted of 3 expert clini- cians. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Adverse events were reported until disease pro- gression or the initiation of additional treatment. Statistical Analysis PFS was defined as the time from the first drug administration until the earliest evidence of disease progression or death that resulted from any cause. Data were censored if a patient had no disease progression at the end of the trial follow-up or was given subsequent treatment before disease progression. was calculated as the time from first drug administration to death as a result of any cause. Median PFS and OS were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare OS and PFS across biologic groups. Hazard ratios were calculated along with 95% CIs. Analysis was carried out by using the statistical software environment R (version 12, http://www.R-project.org). The OR rate was defined as the number of patients who attained CR, CR with incomplete marrow recovery, or partial remission (PR) status for at least 2 months. The CR rate was defined as the number of patients who attained a full CR or CR with incomplete marrow recovery. The CR rate was compared in biologically defined subgroups by using exact logistic regression methods. Odds ratios were calculated along with 95% CI. These analyses were carried out by using STATA 11 software (STATA, College Station, TX; Computing Resource Center, Santa Monica, CA). Continuous variables were converted into two categories by taking the median or some other standard quantity as a cutoff value. Lymphadenopathy was quantified as the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of the six largest lymph nodes. For clinical staging, Binet stages A and B were combined because only four patients were at Binet stage A. ',\n"," 'A comparison of the infection rate in different patient subgroups was carried out by using Fisher’s exact test.

We conducted an international, open-label, randomized phase  3 trial to compare two oral agents, ibrutinib and chlorambucil, in previously un- treated older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS We randomly assigned 269 previously untreated patients who were 65 years of age or older and had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive ibrutinib or chlo- rambucil. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review committee. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 73 years. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than  did chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months), with a risk of progression or death that was 84% lower with ibrutinib than that with chlorambucil (hazard  ratio, 0.16; P<0.001). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival; the estimated survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death that was 84% lower in the ibrutinib group than in the  chlorambucil group (hazard ratio, 0.16; P = 0.001). The overall response rate was higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%, P<0.001). The rates of sustained increases from baseline values in the hemoglobin and platelet levels were higher with ibrutinib. Adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 20% the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea; ad- verse events occurring in at least 20% of those receiving chlorambucil included nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting. ',\n"," 'In the ibrutinib group, four patients had a grade 3 hemorrhage and one had a grade 4 hemorrhage. A total of  87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group are continuing to take ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS Ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as assessed by progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables.

Abstract BACKGROUND—Data regarding the efficacy of treatment with ibrutinib–rituximab, as compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been  limited. METHODS—In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients 70 years of age or  younger with previously untreated CLL to receive either ibrutinib and rituximab for six cycles  (after a single cycle of ibrutinib alone), followed by ibrutinib until disease progression, or six  cycles of chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. The primary  end point was progression-free survival, and overall survival was a secondary end point. We report  the results of a planned interim analysis. RESULTS—A total of 529 patients underwent randomization (354 patients to the ibrutinib– rituximab group, and 175 to the chemoimmunotherapy group).

CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid  cancers, accounting for approximately 11% of hematologic neoplasms. A marked  improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with CLL has  been realized with the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies to purine nucleoside analogue or alkylator-based chemotherapy.1,2 Phase 3 trials have established the chemoimmunotherapy regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as the standard first-line treatment for patients with CLL who are 70 years of age or younger and  who are suitable candidates for such therapy after consideration of organ function and side- effect risks.1,3 The fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab combination appears to be  particularly effective in patients with immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV)–  mutated CLL, with roughly half the patients in that subgroup remaining free from progression up to 8 years after initial treatment.4–7 Although fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab therapy is efficacious, it is associated with substantial toxic  effects, including severe myelosup-pression, a small risk of treatment-related  myelodysplasia, and infectious complications, including opportunistic infections due to T- cell immunosuppression.8 In parallel with advances in chemoimmunotherapy, elucidation of CLL B-cell biology has  identified new therapeutic targets.9 The interruption of leukemia proliferative signals  mediated through the B-cell receptor appears to be one of the most promising approaches. ',\n"," '10–12 Major effects have been seen with ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a B-cell signaling protein involved in B-cell development, differentiation, proliferation, and survival.10,13 Shanafelt et al. Page 2 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. Ibrutinib was initially found to have durable efficacy in patients who had relapsed refractory CLL.13,14 Subsequent phase 3 trials involving previously untreated patients with  progressive CLL who were too frail to receive aggressive therapy showed superior progression-free survival and overall survival with ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil, which led to approval of the drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a first-line  treatment option.15 However, data regarding the efficacy of ibrutinib as a first-line treatment  for patients 70 years of age or younger with CLL, as compared with the efficacious chemoimmunotherapy regimen of fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab, have been limited. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial (E1912) through  the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment  with ibrutinib in combination with six cycles of rituximab, as compared with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab, in previously untreated patients with CLL who were 70 years  of age or younger. Methods Trial Participants Eligible participants were previously untreated patients with CLL or the small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) subtype of CLL who were 70 years of age or younger and who would appropriate candidates for treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Working Group criteria (see the Supplementary  Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).16 Comprehensive eligibility criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients with chromosome 17p13 deletion were excluded from the trial because of the poor response of CLL in these  patients to fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab therapy.1,3,17 Trial Oversight This trial was designed and coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group– American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG– ACRIN) Cancer Research  Group in collaboration with the other NCTN Cooperative Groups. The trial protocol (available at NEJM.org) was approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) central institutional review board and local institutional review boards as required by participating  institutions. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration Helsinki. ',\n"," 'Data that were gathered and analyzed by trial investigators were entered into an  electronic database maintained by the ECOG– ACRIN Biostatistical and Operations Office. The trial was monitored twice annually by a standing data and safety monitoring board that  included persons from both within and outside ECOG– ACRIN. The authors reviewed and  approved the manuscript for submission for publication and vouch for the accuracy and  completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. Ibrutinib was  provided by Pharmacyclics (a subsidiary of AbbVie) under a cooperative research and  development agreement with the NCI. Randomization and Treatment After providing written informed consent, eligible participants underwent randomization, which was stratified according to the age of the patients (<60 years vs. 60 to 70 years),  Shanafelt et al. Page 3 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. ≥2; scores are on a 5-point scale, with higher  numbers indicating greater disability), Rai stage (0 to II [low or intermediate risk] vs. III or  IV [high risk]), and the presence or absence of chromosome 11q22.3 deletion on  fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to  receive either ibrutinib–rituximab or chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab. Patients who were randomly assigned to the ibrutinib–rituximab group received ibrutinib (at  a dose of 420 mg per day until disease progression or an unacceptable level of side effects  occurred) and rituximab (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 1 of cycle 2;  325 mg per square meter on day 2 of cycle 2; and 500 mg per square meter on day 1 of  cycles 3 through 7); each cycle was 28 days. Patients who were randomly assigned to the  chemoimmunotherapy group received six cycles of intravenous fludarabine (at a dose of 25  mg per square meter) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg per square meter) on days 1 through with rituximab (50 mg per square meter on day 1 of cycle 1; 325 mg per square meter day 2 of cycle 1; and 500 mg per square meter on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6) every days. Full treatment information, including instructions regarding dose delays and modifications, is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. ',\n"," 'Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii (tri-methoprim–sulfamethoxazole or alternative) and herpes zoster (valacyclovir or alternative) was given to patients in each group for 1 year  after treatment initiation. All patients received allopurinol (300 mg orally once daily) on  days 1 through 14 of cycle 1. Patients treated with ibrutinib–rituximab also received allopurinol with treatment cycle 2 (the first cycle that included rituximab). Growth factor  support was permitted per guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (see the  Supplementary Appendix).18 Assessments of Safety and Response All adverse events were graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version For the purposes of dose modification, adverse events involving platelet count and hemoglobin level were graded according to the IWCLL CLL Working Group grading scale (see the Supplementary Appendix).16 Responses were graded according to the 2008 IWCLL Working Group criteria that were effect at the start of the trial16 along with the 2018 modification that included the category of  complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery19 (see the Supplementary Appendix). Isolated treatment-related lymphocytosis in the absence of disease progression according to other criteria was not considered to indicate progression until a nadir lymphocyte count was achieved.19,20 Bone marrow biopsies were performed at enrollment and at 12 months to assess response, with central review by an expert hematopathologist (see  the Supplementary Appendix). Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in all patients at enrollment and at the evaluation for response at  12 months. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by means of peripheral-blood flow cytometry with a sensitivity greater than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (see the  Supplementary Appendix). MRD assays were performed at the time of the 12-month  response evaluation and at 24 and 36 months after randomization. Shanafelt et al. Page 4 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. Statistical Analysis The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was defined as the time from  randomization to documented CLL progression or death without documented progression. Patients alive without documented progression had their data censored at the last disease  assessment. ',\n"," 'The trial was designed to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio for progression or death (in the analysis of progression-free survival) of 0.67 (ibrutinib– rituximab vs. chemoimmunotherapy) or less with the use of a stratified log-rank test at the  one-sided alpha level of 2.5%. The planned enrollment was 519 patients, to be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ibrutinib–rituximab or chemoimmunotherapy. With input from the FDA, interim analyses for progression-free survival were planned start at 24 to 27 months after full enrollment and annually until either the efficacy boundary  was crossed or full information (203 events of progression or death) was reached. The  prespecified boundary for the first interim analysis of progression-free survival was 2.807 on  the z-statistic scale, which corresponded to a one-sided P value of 0.0025. A truncated version of the O’Brien–Fleming boundary was to be used subsequently.21 Futility rules for  harm and inefficacy were included (see the Supplementary Appendix). Overall survival, which was defined as time from randomization to death from any cause,  was a secondary end point and was to be tested only if the result in the progression-free survival analysis crossed the efficacy boundary. Patients who were alive had their data  censored at the last date of contact. Interim analyses for overall survival were to start when  the efficacy boundary for progression-free survival was crossed and to continue annually  until early stopping criteria were met or full information (125 deaths) was reached. Critical  values at each interim analysis were to be determined with the use of the truncated O’Brien– Fleming boundary. Stratified log-rank tests22 were used to compare time-to-event distributions. Hazard ratios  were estimated with the use of stratified Cox proportional-hazards models.23 The frequency  of response and the incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups with  the use of Fisher’s exact test. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the characteristics of the patients. Time-to-event distributions were estimated with the use of the  Kaplan–Meier method. The primary analysis was conducted in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had undergone randomization, regardless eligibility or treatment status. P values are two-sided, and 95% confidence intervals are  presented. Results Patients From March 2014 through June 2016, the trial enrolled 529 patients (Table 1). ',\n"," 'total of 354  patients were assigned to the ibrutinib–rituximab group, and 175 to the  chemoimmunotherapy group. A total of 19 patients did not start the protocol-specified therapy (Fig. 1). Shanafelt et al. Page 5 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. At a median follow-up of 33.6 months, 279 of the 354 patients (78.8%) who had been randomly assigned to receive ibrutinib–rituximab continued ibrutinib therapy, and 132 of the  175 patients (75.4%) who had been randomly assigned to receive chemoimmunotherapy continued to be monitored. The mean number of treatment cycles among all the patients the chemoimmunotherapy group who started therapy was five; 67.1% of these patients (106  of 158 patients) received six cycles. At the interim analysis, the median duration treatment in the ibrutinib– rituximab group was 33.0 months (range, 1.0 to 54.0); 16.8% of  the patients discontinued therapy for reasons other than disease progression or death (Table  S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). Efficacy The first interim analysis was performed in September 2018. There were 77 events progression or death and 14 deaths (8 without progression). The Kaplan–Meier estimates progression-free survival and overall survival are shown in Figures 2A and 3, respectively. At 3 years, the percentage of patients with progression-free survival was 89.4% (95%  confidence interval [CI], 86.0 to 93.0) in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, as compared with  72.9% (95% CI, 65.3 to 81.3) in the chemoimmunotherapy group. The difference in progression-free survival crossed the prespecified boundary (hazard ratio for progression death, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.56; P<0.001). Overall survival was higher in the ibrutinib–rituximab group than in the  chemoimmunotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.54; P<0.001). Overall survival at 3 years was 98.8% (95% CI, 97.6 to 100) in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, as compared with 91.5% (95% CI, 86.2 to 97.0) in the chemoimmunotherapy group. Data regarding progression-free survival and overall survival among eligible patients who  started the assigned treatment are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. In prespecified subgroup analyses of progression-free survival, ibrutinib–rituximab was  superior to chemoimmunotherapy independent of age, sex, or Rai stage and was also superior to chemoimmunotherapy in the subgroup of patients with chromosome 11q22.3 deletion (Fig. 2C). ',\n"," 'Ibrutinib–rituximab resulted in superior progression-free survival, compared with chemoimmunotherapy, at 3 years among patients with IGHV-unmutated CLL (90.7% vs. 62.5%; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.50)  (Fig. 2B). At the interim analysis, the difference in progression-free survival at 3 years  among patients with IGHV-mutated CLL was not significant (87.7% in the ibrutinib– rituximab group and 88.0% in the chemoimmunotherapy group; hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI,  0.14 to 1.36) (Fig. S3A in the Supplementary Appendix). The percentage of patients with an overall response as determined by physical examination was higher in the ibrutinib–rituximab group (95.8%; 95% CI, 93.1 to 97.6) than in the  chemoimmunotherapy group (81.1%; 95% CI, 74.5 to 86.6). With the inclusion of CT scan  results and central bone marrow review (when possible), the incidence of complete response  with or without blood count normalization was lower in the ibrutinib–rituximab group (17.2%; 95% CI, 13.4 to 21.6) than in the chemoimmunotherapy group (30.3%; 95% CI, 23.6 to 37.7). Shanafelt et al. Page 6 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. MRD in the peripheral blood at the 12-month response assessment was evaluated in 276 of  354 patients (78.0%) who were treated with ibrutinib–rituximab and in 103 of 175 patients  (58.9%) who received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide– rituximab. A lower percentage of patients who were treated with ibrutinib–rituximab (8.3%;  95% CI, 5.4 to 12.2) than with chemoimmunotherapy (59.2%; 95% CI, 49.1 to 68.8) were  MRD-negative at cycle 12 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Safety All adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were reported in more than 2% of the patients in  either group are summarized in Table 2. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or  higher, independent of attribution, was similar in the two groups (in 282 of 352 patients  [80.1%] treated with ibrutinib–rituximab and in 126 of 158 patients [79.7%] who received  chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide– rituximab, P = 0.91). There was a lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in the ibrutinib– rituximab group than in  the chemoimmunotherapy group (90 patients [25.6%] vs. 71 [44.9%], P<0.001), as well as a  lower incidence of infectious complications, including neutropenic fever (37 patients [10.5%] vs. 32 [20.3%], P = 0.005). ',\n"," 'There was a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 hypertension in the ibrutinib–rituximab group than in the chemoimmunotherapy group (66  patients [18.8%] vs. 13 [8.2%], P = 0.002). Hemorrhagic events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 4 patients (1.1%) in the ibrutinib–rituximab group (all grade 3 events) but in no  patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group (P = 0.32). Cardiac toxic effects of grade 3 or higher occurred in 23 patients (6.5%) treated with  ibrutinib–rituximab, including 13 cases of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, 3 cases of  cardiac chest pain, 2 cases of supraventricular tachycardia, 2 cases of heart failure (nonfatal),  2 cases of pericardial effusion, 1 case of sinus bradycardia, 1 case of ventricular tachycardia,  1 case of cardiac arrest (nonfatal), and 1 case of myocardial infarction. Cardiac toxic effects  of grade 3 or higher occurred in 3 patients who received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab, including 2 cases of atrial fibrillation and 1 case  of acute coronary syndrome. Atrial fibrillation of any grade occurred in 26 patients (7.4%)  receiving ibrutinib–rituximab and in 5 patients (3.2%) receiving chemoimmunotherapy. One  patient in the ibrutinib– rituximab group had atrial fibrillation at enrollment, which was  exacerbated by ibrutinib during cycle 1; the patient had sudden death 21 days after the start  of cycle 2 of ibrutinib–rituximab therapy. A detailed summary of all adverse events of grade  3 or higher that were attributed by the treating physician to trial treatment is provided in  Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix. Causes of death are listed in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. Among the 10 deaths  in the chemoimmunotherapy group, the cause was CLL or therapy-related in the majority patients (4 deaths due to CLL, 2 due to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, 1 due to  lung cancer, 1 due to metastatic colon cancer, 1 due to drug overdose, and 1 due infection). Among the 4 deaths in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, the cause was CLL in the  minority of patients (1 death due to CLL, 1 due to lung adenocarcinoma with respiratory failure, 1 due to acute respiratory failure, and 1 sudden death in a patient with history of  atrial fibrillation).

',\n"," 'Discussion In this randomized trial involving patients 70 years of age or younger who had previously untreated CLL or SLL and did not have chromosome 17p13 deletion, ibrutinib–rituximab treatment was superior to chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide– rituximab with respect to progression-free survival and overall survival. Chemoimmunotherapy led to a higher frequency of complete response and rendered more patients MRD-negative than did ibrutinib– rituximab therapy. Nonetheless, the risk progression or death was 65% lower and the risk of death was 83% lower with ibrutinib– rituximab than with chemoimmunotherapy. The proportion of patients who had an adverse event of grade 3 or higher was similar in the two groups. Since fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab is widely accepted as an effective  chemoimmunotherapy regimen for patients with CLL, the improvements in both  progression-free survival and overall survival that were observed with six cycles ibrutinib–rituximab followed by continuous ibrutinib therapy, as compared with the 6-month  course of chemoimmunotherapy, are notable.1,3–7 Three previous trials have shown survival advantage with one therapy over another among patients with previously untreated  CLL.1,2,15 The advantage of six cycles of ibrutinib–rituximab followed by continuous ibrutinib therapy with regard to these end points exceeded the prespecified thresholds for  superiority at the time of the first interim analysis, despite the fact that the progression-free  survival and overall survival observed among patients treated with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab was similar to or better than that anticipated on the basis of  historical studies (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).1,3 Since the current advantage  with regard to overall survival was based on a limited number of events, the long-term follow-up for survival among the patients in this trial, as well as for the incidence myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia, second cancers, and infectious complications, will be important. Ibrutinib–rituximab resulted in superior progression-free survival in high-risk subgroups, including patients with Rai stage III or IV disease, chromosome 11q22.3 deletion, and  unmutated IGHV. Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab has proved to be particularly effective in patients with IGHV-mutated CLL,5,6 with roughly  half the patients in this lower-risk subgroup remaining in remission 8 to 10 years after the  initiation of treatment.7 Longer follow-up in this subgroup of patients will provide additional  clinical insights. ',\n"," 'The safety results regarding ibrutinib–rituximab therapy in the E1912 trial were consistent  with the results of previous trials of ibrutinib-based therapy.13–15 The risk of atrial  fibrillation of any grade was 7.4% in the ibrutinib–rituximab group. The recently reported  Alliance 041202 trial, which tested first-line ibrutinib–rituximab therapy and ibrutinib monotherapy, showed that the incidence of atrial fibrillation in these two groups was 14%  and 17%, respectively, among patients with CLL who were 65 years of age or older (median  age, 71 years).24 An age of 65 years or older, history of hypertension, and history of atrial  fibrillation are risk factors for the development of atrial fibrillation during ibrutinib  treatment,25 which suggests that the lower incidence of cardiac complications in the E1912  Shanafelt et al. Page 8 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. trial may be due to the younger patient population (median age, 58 years) relative to a  pooled analysis of patients participating in other trials (median age, 67 years).25 Unexplained or unwitnessed death, which can be due to cardiac arrhythmias, was observed in only 1 patient in the E1912 trial, as compared with 11 of 361 patients (3%) treated with  ibrutinib in the Alliance 041202 trial.24 Grade 3 or 4 hypertension in patients who were  treated with ibrutinib–rituximab in the E1912 trial also occurred at a lower frequency than  that seen among patients in the Alliance 041202 trial (18.8% vs. 34%).24 Major hemorrhagic events (all grade 3) occurred in 1.1% of the patients in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, with  no fatal events. As of the interim analysis, one case of nonfatal cardiac arrest has been  observed in the E1912 trial. Given the long-term, indefinite use of ibrutinib, we continue to  monitor this end point closely. The superior overall survival with ibrutinib-based therapy that was observed in the E1912  trial but not in the Alliance 041202 trial is notable because the chemoimmunotherapy that  was used in the E1912 trial is more efficacious than the chemoimmunotherapy used in the  Alliance trial.3 Several possible factors may contribute to these findings. First, more  efficacious therapy may contribute more to survival prospects in younger patients with CLL  with fewer coexisting conditions, who are less likely than older patients to die from  unrelated causes. ',\n"," 'Second, more severe treatment-related toxic effects, including an increased  risk of sudden death among older patients, may offset decreases in disease-related mortality  among older patients. The higher mortality among patients receiving active treatment in the  Alliance trial (7% of patients treated with ibrutinib–rituximab) relative to the participants in  the E1912 trial (1%) and reported outcomes in a study in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtypes support this notion.26 Although all the ibrutinib-treated patients in the E1912 trial also received rituximab, the  benefits of combining rituximab with ibrutinib are unclear. No differences in progression- free survival or overall survival between the ibrutinib-alone group and the ibrutinib– rituximab group in the Alliance 041202 trial have been observed to date,24 a finding that is  consistent with the results of a randomized comparison of ibrutinib alone and ibrutinib– rituximab in a trial predominantly involving patients with relapsed CLL.27 It is unclear  whether these findings can be extrapolated to patients 70 years of age or younger with  previously untreated CLL. In conclusion, among patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL,  the combination of six cycles of ibrutinib–rituximab therapy followed by ibrutinib given  continuously until relapse resulted in progression-free survival and overall survival that were  superior to those with 6 months of chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab. However, indefinite use of ibrutinib therapy has been associated with substantial expense28 and the potential for long-term toxic effects and may  increase the risk of clonal selection leading to drug resistance.29,30 Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.

Patients who are refractory or relapse after  ibrutinib experience poor outcomes. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of  BCL-2 that has activity in heavily-pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. This phase  two, multicentre, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax  for patients with CLL refractory to or who relapsed during or after ibrutinib. Methods—Patients at least 18 years of age were eligible for study enrollment if they required  therapy according to criteria from the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL), had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of ≤2,  adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μL irrespective of growth factor  support, platelet count ≥30,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL), and creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min. At study entry, all patients were screened for Richter’s transformation by positron emission  tomography and were excluded if Richter’s transformation was confirmed on biopsy. Patients  received venetoclax starting at 20mg daily with stepwise dose ramp-up over five weeks to the  target 400mg daily dose. For patients with rapidly-progressing disease, an accelerated schedule of  administration was utilized. Treatment continued until disease progression or discontinuation due  to other reasons. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  venetoclax monotherapy. Efficacy was measured by overall response rate, defined as the  proportion of patients with an overall response based on the investigator’s assessment per iwCLL  criteria. Safety was evaluated via adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments. ',\n"," 'adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments. This study  is ongoing and data for this interim analysis per regulatory agency request were collected as of  June 30, 2017 and included all patients who received at least one dose of venetoclax. This trial was  registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02141282. Findings—Patients were recruited from 15 sites across the United States between September 2014 and November 2016. The study enrolled 91 patients who previously received ibrutinib, 43 in  the main cohort and 48 in the expansion cohort. At the time of analysis, the median time on study  (ie, follow up) was 14 months (range: 0·1–31; IQR: 8–18) for all 91 patients, 19 months (range:  0·1–26; IQR: 9–27) for 43 patients in the main cohort, and 12 months (0·1–18; IQR: 8–15) for 48  patients in the expansion cohort. An objective response was achieved in 59 (65%) of 91 patients  (95% CI: 53%, 74%. Main cohort: 30 [70%] of43, 95% CI: 54%; 83%; expansion cohort: [60%] of 48, 95% CI: 43%, 72%). Eight (9%) of 91 patients achieved complete remission.

Interpretation—Venetoclax showed durable clinical activity and favourable tolerability patients with CLL whose disease progressed during or after prior treatment with ibrutinib. INTRODUCTION Small molecule inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCRi) signaling target an essential biology in  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and have rapidly supplanted cytotoxic chemotherapy for both untreated and relapsed disease.1,2 The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has demonstrated high rates of durable response and prolonged survival and is  approved for the treatment of previously-untreated or relapsed CLL.3–6 Although many patients achieve sustained disease control with continuous ibrutinib, few  effective options are currently available for CLL progressing during or after therapy. ',\n"," 'Relapse  in high-risk patients (ie, 17p deletion [del(17)(p13·1)] and/or complex abnormal karyotype)  is more frequently observed, with a 30-month estimated progression-free survival (PFS) for  patients with del(17)(p13·1) of 48% vs 87% for patients without del(17)(p13·1) or del(11) (q22·3).4,7,8 Adverse events (AEs) can further lead to discontinuation.9 Optimal therapy for patients with CLL progressing after ibrutinib has yet to be determined in prospective studies. Outcomes after discontinuing ibrutinib are poor and progression can  occur rapidly, in part due to the limited efficacy of available therapies in this setting.7–9  Recent investigations have identified acquired resistance mutations in the ibrutinib binding  site C481 of BTK and/or phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCG2) in the majority of patients who progressed while receiving ibrutinib.7,10 New therapies in the setting of disease progression  following ibrutinib are critical. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor that approved in the United States for patients with del(17)(p13·1) CLL who have received least one prior therapy and in the EU and other countries for patients who are unsuitable for  Jones et al.

Additionally, the ability of venetoclax to eliminate ibrutinib- resistant clones bearing BTK C481S or PLCG2 mutations has not been evaluated. Given the promising activity of venetoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL13,14 and poor outcomes in patients who relapsed after or are refractory to ibrutinib, we conducted the  present study to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax in this population. METHODS Study Design and Participants This phase two, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter trial enrolled patients with CLL  relapsed after or refractory to ibrutinib (includes discontinuation of prior ibrutinib due to  AEs followed by progression off therapy). Patients were enrolled initially in the main cohort  of the study and a subsequent study amendment permitted enrollment expansion to further  establish the activity of venetoclax in patients with CLL relapsed/refractory to BCRi therapy  (expansion cohort). ',\n"," 'Patients were enrolled in study arms based on the last BCRi received  (Figure 1). Accrual of approximately 40 patients was planned initially (main cohort) and a  subsequent study amendment permitted accrual of up to 60 additional patients to collect  additional data and further establish the activity of venetoclax in patients with CLL relapsed/ refractory to BCRi therapy (expansion cohort) (Figure 1). A separate cohort of patients with  CLL relapsed/refractory to idelalisib (n=36) was also included in this study and will be  reported in a separate publication. Ten patients who were previously treated with idelalisib  were included in the analysis reported here because ibrutinib was the last BCRi they  received prior to enrollment in this study. Patients were recruited from academic, public, and  private hospitals and clinics in the United States. The washout period for prior BCRi was  seven days in the main cohort and reduced to three days for the expansion cohort. The  primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax monotherapy. Efficacy was measured by objective response rate (ORR) and safety was evaluated via adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments. Patients at least 18 years of age with relapsed/refractory CLL who required therapy according to the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria were enrolled if their disease was refractory to treatment or progressed after  discontinuation of ibrutinib.15 Per protocol, the definitions of relapse and refractory were  based on iwCLL 2008 criteria.15 Relapse was defined as a patient who had previously achieved a response to treatment, but after a period of 6 or more months, demonstrated evidence of disease progression and refractory was defined as treatment failure or disease  progression within 6 months to the last anti-leukemic therapy.15 Patients were evaluated for  Richter’s transformation at study entry by positron emission tomography, mandatory biopsy  for lesions with high standardized uptake value, and excluded if confirmed on biopsy. Patients with active and uncontrolled autoimmune cytopenias, unresolved toxicity from prior  Jones et al. Page 4 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. therapy, or a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation within one year of study entry  were also excluded. There was no minimum estimated life expectancy mandated for study  entry, provided all protocol inclusion criteria were met. ',\n"," 'Karyotype was not assessed at the  time of screening for the study and therefore data for complex karyotype are not available. Other mutational data (ie, TP53 mutation status, chromosomal abnormalities) were reported  by investigators. All molecular subtypes of CLL were included in the study. All patients  provided written informed consent. Complete enrollment criteria provided in the appendix  (p.4). The institutional review board at each participating site approved the study protocol. The  study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Procedures Venetoclax was administered orally, once daily. Patients received venetoclax 20mg daily for  one week, followed by weekly ramp up to 50mg, 100mg, 200mg, and then to the final daily  dose of 400mg by week five (appendix p.7); in the expansion cohort, an accelerated dose  ramp up over three weeks was permitted for patients who had high tumor burden with clinical signs of progression during screening (appendix p.8). Additionally, dose escalation  of venetoclax to 600mg was allowed in the expansion cohort for patients who had not  achieved an adequate response after assessment at week 12. The on-target effects venetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumour size (debulking) and may pose a risk tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) during initial dosing. To mitigate this risk, prophylaxis and  monitoring procedures were implemented, which are described in the appendix (p.8). Safety was monitored through 30 days post treatment. Laboratory assessments and AE monitoring were done throughout the study and into the 30-day post-treatment period. AEs  were graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, version 4·0.16 Laboratory monitoring for TLS was conducted during the 5-week dose ramp-up and TLS was assessed based on criteria established by Howard and colleagues.17 Dose adjustments were recommended for patients with grade 3 or 4 AEs. At the time of the  first event, venetoclax could be interrupted and dosing resumed at the target dose following  resolution of the AE. If subsequent AEs required dose interruptions, dosing could resume at  a lower dose following resolution of the AE. For neutropenia, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) could be administered concurrently with venetoclax as needed  and was strongly recommended for patients with grade 4 events (absolute neutrophil count  <500/μL). ',\n"," 'If the patient developed febrile neutropenia or grade 4 neutropenia persisted for  more than one week despite growth factor support, then venetoclax dosing was interrupted until recovery of neutrophil count >500/μL. Following dose interruption, venetoclax could  then be re-initiated at a lower dose. For blood chemistry changes or symptoms suggestive TLS, dosing on the next day was withheld unless there was resolution of changes/symptoms within 24–48 hours of the last dose; subsequently dosing resumed at the same dose. changes or symptoms resolved more than 48 hours after the last dose, dosing was resumed at  a lower dose (see also appendix p.9).

Treatment continued until disease progression or discontinuation due to other reasons and  patients were removed from the study at the time of disease progression and/or  discontinuation of venetoclax for other reasons. Outcomes The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with overall response based on the investigator’s assessment.15 Response was assessed by the  investigator based on physical exam, laboratory results, computed tomography or magnetic  resonance imaging, and bone marrow evaluation according to iwCLL criteria.15  Assessments were performed at screening and subsequent responses for patients in the main  cohort were assessed by investigators at weeks eight, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter, to one year. For patients in the main cohort, response data upon completion of 24 weeks on  venetoclax were also reviewed by an independent review committee (IRC). Patients in the  expansion cohort underwent response assessments at weeks 12 and 36. Responses were confirmed by a second assessment at least two months after first assessed. Bone marrow  aspiration and biopsy were performed at screening and within two months after other criteria  for complete remission (CR) were observed. All patients, including those identified having stable disease, received venetoclax until disease progression or discontinuation due to  other reasons. This open-label phase 2 trial was a proof-of-concept study that was designed  to assess the efficacy of venetoclax in ibrutinib-treated patients at earlier time points (weeks  8 and 24) in the main cohort. Responses improved over time in patients from the main  cohort as they have been evaluated every 12 weeks after week 24 for up to one year. ',\n"," 'Once  established that there was efficacy in this population, the expansion cohort had an increased  duration of efficacy assessment to keep consistent with the pivotal trial of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with del(17)(p13·1) CLL and to allow for pooled analyses across  venetoclax monotherapy trials in the future.13 Secondary endpoints included time-to-event analyses. Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the number of days from the date of first response to the earliest recurrence disease progression. If a patient was still responding, then the patient’s data were censored at  the date of the patient’s last available disease assessment. Patients who never had a response  had censored data on the date of enrollment. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the  number of days from the date of first dose or enrollment if not dosed to the date of earliest  disease progression. All events of disease progression were included regardless of whether  progression occurred while the patient was taking venetoclax or had previously  discontinued. If the patient did not experience disease progression, then the data were  censored at the date of the last available disease assessment. PFS was defined as the number  of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression or death. Data  were censored at the time of last tumor assessment for patients without an event or at the  time of data cutoff if the assessment was done after the cutoff date. Overall survival (OS)  was defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death for all  dosed patients. For patients who did not die, data were censored at the date of last study visit  or the last known date to be alive, whichever was later. Jones et al. Page 6 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was an exploratory endpoint. Six-color flow cytometry (sensitivity: 10–4) performed according to ERIC protocol18,19 was used to evaluate MRD in  peripheral blood for all patients beginning at week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter for  those achieving partial remission (PR) or better. ',\n"," 'Exploratory identification of BTK and  PLCG2 mutations was performed for all patients enrolled to the main cohort according published methods.20 Health economic and patient-reported outcome measures (eg, EORTC  QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 [measure of health related quality of life specific CLL] and EQ-5D-5L [measure of general health status with visual analogue scale]) were  also exploratory assessments that will be reported in a separate publication. Methods for  exploratory analyses of MRD evaluation and resistance mutation testing, as well pharmacokinetic assessments are in the appendix (p.12). Statistical Analysis This study is ongoing and data for this interim analysis per regulatory agency request were  collected as of June 30, 2017. Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who  received at least one dose of venetoclax. Exploratory MRD and resistance mutation analyses  are included for patients with available data. Analyses were performed by using SAS  software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Initial target enrollment for the main cohort of the study was approximately 60 patients, with  40 patients with ibrutinib-resistant/refractory CLL in one arm and 20 patients with idelalisib-resistant/refractory CLL in the second arm (reported in a separate publication). With the initial activity of venetoclax observed in patients in the main cohort, a subsequent  study amendment permitted additional enrollment of approximately 60 patients with either  ibrutinib- or idelalisib-resistant relapsed/refractory CLL in the expansion cohort, which was  similar to the number of patients targeted for the main cohort. Patients who had received  both agents and any additional interim therapy were enrolled into the corresponding arm on  the basis of their most recent BCRi treatment. There were no planned hypotheses testing on  the primary efficacy endpoint, ORR. ORR is presented by a point estimate and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. A sample size of 20 patients ensured that the  distance of true rate was within 23% of the observed rate, with 95% confidence interval (CI). A sample size of 40 patients would ensure that the distance of true rate was within 17% of  the observed rate, with 95% confidence. A sample size of 60 patients would ensure that the  distance of true rate was within 14% of the observed rate, with 95% confidence. ',\n"," 'ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with an overall response based on the investigator’s assessment and calculated for all patients based on iwCLL criteria.15 The 95%  confidence interval based on binomial distribution was constructed for calculated ORR. DOR, TTP, PFS, and OS were key secondary endpoints based on investigator assessment and were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology, with median time-to-event calculated along with the corresponding 95% CI.

RESULTS Patients Patients were recruited from 15 sites across the United States between September 2014 and  November 2016. A total of 91 patients were enrolled (main cohort, n=43; expansion cohort,  n=48), with all 91 patients included in demographics, efficacy and safety analyses described  below. Primary reasons for discontinuation of prior ibrutinib included disease progression (50 [55%] of 91 patients; based on iwCLL criteria15 with or without evidence of BTK or  PLCG2 mutation during treatment), and AEs (30 [33%] of 91 patients; these patients subsequently progressed after discontinuing ibrutinib). The remaining patients had achieved  maximal clinical benefit with ibrutinib (6 [7%] of 91 patients), completed a defined course  of treatment (3 [3%] of 91 patients), and/or discontinued for other unspecified reasons (2  [2%] of 91 patients) with subsequent CLL progression. ',\n"," 'Per iwCLL criteria definitions,15 (31%) of 91 patients relapsed during or after discontinuation of prior ibrutinib and 62 (68%)  of 91 patients were refractory to prior ibrutinib (Table 1). Screen failures occurred in 27  patients, six of whom were excluded based on biopsy-confirmed Richter’s transformation (see appendix p.14 for all reasons for screen failures). Disposition on Treatment As of June 30, 2017, median time on study (ie, follow up) was 14 months (range: 0·1–31;  IQR: 8–18); 19 months (range: 0·1–26; IQR: 9–27) for the main cohort and 12 months (range: 0·1–18; IQR: 8–15) for the expansion cohort. Forty-six (51%) of 91 patients continue venetoclax treatment (appendix p.14). The primary reason for discontinuation venetoclax was CLL progression in 22 (24%) of 91 patients and Richter’s transformation five (5%) of 91 patients (see appendix p.15). The remaining patients discontinued for AEs (6  [7%] of 91 patients), proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in remission (5 [6%]  of 91 patients), consent withdrawn (1 [1%] of 91 patients), investigator’s request (1 [1%] of  91 patients), and other reasons (5 [6%] of 91 patients). Seventeen (19%) of 91 patients died,  with seven due to CLL progression; seven deaths occurred within 30 days after the last dose  of venetoclax due to disease progression, Corynebacterium sepsis, multi-organ failure, septic  shock, possible cytokine release syndrome on subsequent therapy, mechanical asphyxia, and  one cause of death was unknown. None of these deaths were attributed to treatment with  venetoclax. Jones et al. Page 8 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. Efficacy The investigator-assessed ORR was 59 (65%) of 91 patients (95% CI: 53%, 74%) (Table and median time to first response was 2·5 months (range: 1·6–15) and median time to best  response was 7·9 months (range: 3·5–19). Fifty-one (56%) of 91 patients achieved PR or  nodular PR (nPR), and 8 (9%) of 91 patients achieved CR or CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi). Median time to first PR/nPR was 2·6 months (range: 1·6–16.4) and  to confirmatory second assessment per protocol (at least two months after first assessed) was  7·6 months (range: 5–17·7). Median time to CR/CRi was 8·2 months (range: 3·5–19). Twenty-two (24%) of 91 patients had stable disease as best response and five (6%) had CLL  progression. ',\n"," 'Nineteen (59%) of 32 patients with B symptoms at baseline reported resolution  of symptoms by week eight. For patients in the main cohort who had been treated for a median of 19 months, responses were observed for 30 (70%) of 43 patients (95% CI: 54%, 83%). Following a median time  on venetoclax of 12 months, the response rate for patients in the expansion cohort was 29  (60%) of 48 patients (95% CI: 43%, 72%), with 13 patients having stable disease and four  with progression. Two patients in the expansion cohort escalated to a daily dose of 600mg  venetoclax due to clinical progression, and neither had improvement at higher dose. seven patients in the expansion cohort who were scheduled to receive accelerated ramp up  due to rapidly progressive CLL, five were able to reach the target 400mg dose with four  achieving PR and one patient discontinued due to CLL progression. The two remaining patients discontinued due to CLL progression before reaching the 400mg dose. Response rates at 24 weeks reported by an IRC in the 43 patients in the main cohort were  similar to those assessed by the investigators (IRC, 30 [70%] of 43; investigator-assessed, [67%] of 43).21 Evaluations were discordant between investigators and IRC for ten patients;  two with CR by investigator assessment were deemed as PR by IRC, one with investigator- assessed CR was evaluated as CRi by IRC, two with investigator-assessed nPR were PR by  IRC, two with investigator-assessed PR were non-responders per IRC, and three patients with stable disease by investigator assessment were considered PR by IRC. Discrepancies were primarily due to differences in interpretation of splenomegaly by CT scan, the sum  product of the lymph nodes by radiographic assessment given different nodes chosen, and  timing of the CT scan. The investigator-assessed median TTP for all patients was 24·7 months (95% CI: 19·6, -),  with an estimated rate at 12 month of 80% (95% CI: 69%, 87%) (Figure 2A). Median PFS  was 24·7 months (95% CI: 19·2, -), with an estimated 12-month PFS rate of 75% (95% CI:  64%, 83%) (Figure 2B); the estimated 12-month OS was 91% (95% CI: 83%, 95%; Figure 2C). Among responding patients, median DOR has not yet been reached (95% CI: 17·6, Figure 2D), and estimated 12-month DOR was 88% (95% CI: 76%, 95%).

Among responding patients who discontinued prior ibrutinib due to AEs, median DOR had not yet been reached  (95% CI: 14·3, -), with an estimated 12-month of 89% (95% CI: 63%, 97%). For patients who discontinued prior ibrutinib due to disease progression, median DOR on venetoclax was  21·7 months (95% CI: 16·6, -), with an estimated 12-month rate of 88% (95% CI: 67%, 96%). Response rates were similar for patients with high-risk chromosomal abnormalities compared with patients without these factors. Of patients with known del(17)(p13·1) and/or  TP53 mutation, 28 (61%) of 46 patients (95% CI: 45%, 75%) achieved an objective response, including 4 CR or CRi and 23 nPR or PR. Of patients who did not have either del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation, 30 (67%) of 45 patients (95% CI: 51%, 80%) achieved an objective response, including 4 CR and 26 nPR or PR. Median PFS was 19·6  months (95% CI: 15·4, 24·7) for patients with known del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation, with a 12-month PFS estimate of 72% (95% CI: 56%, 83%). For patients without these chromosomal abnormalities, median PFS had not yet been reached (95% CI: 19·2, -) and 12- month estimate was 79% (95% CI: 64%, 89%). OS estimate at 12 months for both patients with or without known del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation was 91% (95% CI: 78%, 97%). For responders, median DOR was 21·9 months (95% CI: 17·6, -), with 12-month estimate 92% (95% CI: 73%, 98%) for patients with known del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation.

Efficacy analyses for patients with lymph nodes <5 cm as measured at baseline compared with ≥5 cm are described in the appendix (p.18). Fifty-seven patients were assessed for MRD in peripheral blood beginning at week 24, with  MRD being an exploratory endpoint of the study. Twenty-four (42%) of 57 patients assessed  achieved a MRD-negative result in peripheral blood (Figure 3A; 24 [26%] of all 91 patients  per intent-to-treat principles), with five of 13 patients assessed demonstrating subsequent  MRD-negativity in bone marrow. For the majority of patients who had an MRD-positive assessment in peripheral blood, the actual percentage of CLL cells present were low (Figure  3A). At the inception of the study, there was no plan to discontinue venetoclax so all five  patients who achieved MRD-negativity in both peripheral blood and bone marrow are currently active on study and continue venetoclax treatment. One patient who achieved MRD-negativity in peripheral blood at 5 months subsequently discontinued venetoclax due  to CLL progression at 13 months on therapy. Median PFS had not been reached for patients  with MRD negativity in blood and was 24·7 months (95% CI: 15·4, -) for patients who were  MRD positive (Figure 3B), and there was a significant difference in PFS between MRD- negative and MRD-positive patients (p=0·01 by log-rank test).

There was no difference in PFS for patients  with versus without mutations (median PFS for patients with mutations was 21·9 months and  was 15·4 months for patients without mutations; p=0·96 by log-rank test). In ten patients with BTK C481S mutations, samples were available at baseline and the end  of the first week of therapy, with allelic frequency shown in the appendix (p.19). Additionally, in eight patients from one institution with C481S mutations, samples were  available at baseline and the end of 24, 48, and 72 weeks of therapy (appendix, p.19). these eight patients, allelic frequency of C481S BTK decreased in all, and tended to re- emerge prior to progression (appendix, p.19). Safety Across all 91 patients, the most common AEs of any grade were neutropenia in 56 (62%)  patients, nausea in 51 (56%) patients, anaemia in 48 (53%) patients, diarrhoea in 47 (52%)  patients, and thrombocytopenia in 43(47%) patients (Table 3); the frequency of these AEs  was similar for the main and expansion cohorts. Treatment-emergent grade 3/4 events were  primarily hematologic and included neutropenia in 46 (51%) of 91 patients, anemia in 26  (29%) of 91 patients, thrombocytopenia in 26 (29%) of 91 patients, and lymphocytopenia 14 (15%) of 91 patients. Median time to the first grade 3/4 event was 21 days (range: 1–723)  for neutropenia and 21 days (range: 1–582) for thrombocytopenia. Twenty-four (26%) of 91  patients had pre-existing neutropenia and 54 (59%) of 91 patients had thrombocytopenia. Twenty-seven (30%) of 91 patients received G-CSF during the study for management neutropenia and/or infections. Forty-five (50%) of 91 patients experienced a serious AE,  with the most frequent serious AEs (in more than 2 patients) being febrile neutropenia in 10  (11%) and pneumonia in 5 (6%) of 91 patients. Serious AEs considered possibly related venetoclax treatment were febrile neutropenia (n=2), pneumonia (n=1), increased potassium  levels (n=1), hyperphosphatemia (n=1), and hyperkalemia (n=1). ',\n"," 'Thirty-two (35%) of 91  patients interrupted venetoclax because of AEs, with neutropenia being the most common  reason for dosing interruption in 9 patients. Fifteen (16%) of 91 patients required a dosage  reduction, most commonly due to nausea in 12 patients, neutropenia in 11 patients, and  diarrhoea in 9 patients. All dose adjustments for laboratory abnormalities occurred during  dose ramp up. Six patients discontinued venetoclax due to AEs of multi-organ failure, dysphagia and stomach ulcers, Corynebacterium sepsis, salivary gland cancer, and mechanical asphyxia. Four patients discontinued within 30 days of starting venetoclax and  two patients discontinued after one year of therapy with salivary gland cancer and asphyxia. Six deaths occurred within 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax due to AEs Corynebacterium sepsis (n=1), multi-organ failure (n=1), septic shock (n=1), possible Jones et al. Page 11 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. cytokine release syndrome on subsequent therapy (n=1), mechanical asphyxia (n=1), and  one cause of death was unknown (n=1) (Table 3). Electrolyte abnormalities  (hyperphosphatemia and hyperuricemia or hyperkalemia, respectively) meeting Howard criteria17 for laboratory TLS were only observed in two patients with high tumour burden;  both cases occurred during the 200mg dose of the standard ramp-up period. DISCUSSION Ibrutinib therapy has transformed the management of both untreated and relapsed CLL. However, acquired resistance to ibrutinib, most commonly observed in the setting previously treated and high-risk genomic disease, has been associated with poor outcomes. 8,10,26 Effective management and treatment for these patients represents an unmet need. Here, we report results of the first prospective study of any therapy for patients who were  previously treated with ibrutinib, of whom 50 (55%) of 91 patients discontinued ibrutinib  due to disease progression and 30 (33%) of 91 patients due to AEs. The rate of response venetoclax was high, with an investigator-assessed ORR of 59 (65%) of 91 patients (95%  CI: 53%, 74%). Responses were also observed for patients with historically poor outcomes,  including those who discontinued prior ibrutinib due to disease progression and those with  high-risk chromosomal abnormalities del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation. ',\n"," 'Safety data are  consistent with previous reports of single-agent venetoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL, with  the frequency of adverse events reported for this heavily pre-treated population of patients  with CLL refractory to or relapsed after ibrutinib being similar to that reported for  venetoclax in a broader relapsed/refractory CLL population.13,14 Despite observations highly proliferative disease in relapsed CLL upon discontinuation of ibrutinib, venetoclax  was not associated with an elevated risk for TLS when recommended dose ramp up, prophylaxis, and monitoring were applied. As expected in this heavily-pretreated population,  cytopenias and febrile neutropenia were commonly observed. All cases were effectively managed with dosage adjustment and/or supportive care and did not lead to discontinuation of venetoclax. Per secondary Kaplan-Meier analyses, responses have been durable. Additionally, four five patients who initiated venetoclax via accelerated dose ramp up due to high tumour  burden and signs of rapid progression at screening achieved PR on venetoclax. Across efficacy and safety results, the outcomes on venetoclax reported for these patients who were  previously treated with ibrutinib are similar to results with venetoclax monotherapy broader relapsed/refractory CLL patients.14 Venetoclax acts as a BH3-mimetic, targeting BCL-2 in mitochondria independent of BCR  signaling, and as such we hypothesized that BTK mutant clones would not confer resistance to venetoclax.26 In the subset of patients for whom available mutation data were available,  we observed responses with venetoclax in 12 (71%) of 17 of cases where known ibrutinib resistance mutations were present at study entry, which supports the hypothesis based on  mechanism of action. Furthermore, the allelic frequency of C481S BTK decreased for eight  patients with serial data available up to 72 weeks on venetoclax, suggesting the potential for  venetoclax to eradicate ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones. Jones et al. Page 12 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. A number of studies evaluating a broad range of therapeutic approaches have assessed the  relationship between MRD and outcomes, and available evidence suggests that patients with  MRD-negative status at the end of treatment have improved survival, independent of clinical  response.27 In the current study, patients achieving MRD-negative responses experienced superior PFS, despite the fact that most achieved an objective response no better than PR. The majority of these patients with MRD-negative PR had low-volume residual nodal disease by imaging criteria. ',\n"," 'This study has the following limitations including that this was a proof-of-concept study to  first evaluate the activity of venetoclax in this population so was designed to be an open- label study. Furthermore, the wide confidence intervals for the ORR reported due to the  number of patients in each cohort. Efficacy analyses were limited by mutational status (eg,  IGHV) and karyotype status as data collection was not uniform; data for complex karyotype  was not available and IGHV testing was incomplete as accessible historic data were reported  by investigators at study start. Additionally, longer follow up will be needed to better  establish the durability of response to venetoclax in this patient population. This publication only reports on the patients who received ibrutinib as their last BCRi prior  the enrollment on the study. As ibrutinib and idelalisib are approved for different indications  and in different regions, the patients who received idelalisib as their last BCRi prior the  enrollment will be reported in a separate publication to provide adequate attention to each  patient population. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes have not yet been fully analyzed  and will be reported at a later time. In conclusion, venetoclax achieved a high rate of response among patients progressing after  ibrutinib, including a subset with ibrutinib-resistance mutations, many of whom have heavily  pre-treated disease harboring high-risk genetic aberrations. Venetoclax has demonstrated durable clinical activity and favourable tolerability across high-risk patient groups, including  results from this prospective study of treatment for patients with CLL progression following  ibrutinib.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this study Evidence accumulated prior to the study suggested that signaling via B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway could play an important role in the development of CLL. The  advent of BCR inhibitors (BCRi) transformed treatment for chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia (CLL), though patients who are refractory or relapse after these therapies experience poor outcomes. We searched PubMed for clinical trial reports up to end 2014 (year of study start), to identify novel agents for treatment of CLL, using the terms:  “chronic lymphocytic leukemia” and “CLL” in addition to “targeted therapy” “novel” “agent.” For the timeframe searched, 42 articles were identified. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, demonstrated high rates of durable response and was approved for previously-treated patients with CLL. Though many patients can have sustained disease control on ibrutinib, patients with high-risk prognostic factors (eg, chromosome 17p deletion) often relapse and some developed resistance mutations even after achieving an initial response to therapy. Effective treatment options for patients who relapsed or were refractory to ibrutinib had not been  well characterized at the time of this study initiation. At the time of study initiation in 2014, optimal therapy for patients with CLL relapsed/ refractory to ibrutinib had yet to be determined in prospective studies and represented critical unmet need in CLL treatment. Venetoclax is an orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor, with a mechanism of action that is  independent of the BCR pathway. Added value of this study To the best of our knowledge, this phase 2 study was the first prospective trial to evaluate  treatment for patients progressing on or following ibrutinib. Based on prior data venetoclax monotherapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, we hypothesized that  venetoclax would be tolerable and achieve responses in patients with CLL relapsed/ refractory to ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Venetoclax had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with other  clinical studies of venetoclax monotherapy, and is highly active in patients with CLL  relapsed/refractory to ibrutinib. Moreover, responses to venetoclax were reported among  patients with baseline ibrutinib-resistance mutations, with allelic frequency of mutations  decreasing with time on therapy for patients with serial assessments, suggesting the  potential for venetoclax to eradicate ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones. Implications of all the available evidence Few effective options are currently available for CLL progressing during or after ibrutinib, and our data support the use of venetoclax monotherapy in this patient population. Importantly, data on ibrutinib resistance mutations indicate that venetoclax may potentially eradicate ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones, which has not yet been reported  in the context of a prospective clinical trial and represents an important advance in the  management of ibrutinib-resistant CLL.

Patients received rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil every four weeks for six cycles. Rituximab plus chlorambucil-treated patients without a complete response after Cycle 6 received chlorambu- cil monotherapy for at least six additional cycles or until complete response. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (confirmed by bone marrow biopsy) after Cycle 6 in first-line patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease, and safety. Overall, 357 patients were randomized (rit- uximab plus bendamustine, n=178; rituximab plus chlorambucil, n=179; intent-to-treat population), including 241 first-line patients (n=121 and n=120, respectively); 355 patients received treatment (n=177 and n=178, respectively; safety population). In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; P=0.002) and median progression-free survival (ritux- imab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil,  30 months; P=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall sur- vival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus ben- damustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% vs. 36%). Overall adverse event incidence was similar (rituximab plus bendamustine, 98%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 97%).

Chemotherapy options for these patients include bendamustine (B) and chlorambucil (Clb). In treatment-naïve CLL patients, phase II studies showed promising efficacy with rituximab plus B (R-B) Clb (R-Clb), 8,9  while the phase III CLL11 study demon- strated improved efficacy with R-Clb and obinutuzumab plus Clb (G-Clb) versus Clb monotherapy. 10,11 G-Clb also increased progression-free survival (PFS) and complete response (CR) rates versus R-Clb, 10,11 although infusion- related reactions and neutropenia were more common; infection rates were not increased, however. While a phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of CR and PFS with B versusClb in treatment-naïve CLL, 12,13 the activity of R-B versusR-Clb has not been directly com- pared. Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. ',\n"," 'Herein, we present results from the randomized, open- label, multicenter, phase IIIb MABLE study, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of R-B and R-Clb in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. Methods  Study design  Patients received rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m Day [D] 1, Cycle [C] 1 and 500 mg/m D1, C2-C6) plus B (intravenous 90 mg/m [1L] or 70 mg/m [2L] D1 and D2, C1-C6) or Clb (oral 10 mg/m D1-D7, C1-C6) every four weeks for six cycles. R-Clb patients without CR after C6 received Clb monotherapy for ≤6 additional cycles or until CR. After treatment completion, patients were followed every three months for one year, then every six months until data cut-off. Treatment was discontinued if the patient had progressive disease. MABLE was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local laws, and approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees at participating centers. All patients provided written informed con- sent. Patients Patients were aged ≥18 years, with confirmed CLL requiring treatment as per the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) cri- teria, Binet stage B/C disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, and investigator assess- ment of ineligibility for fludarabine-based treatment (Online Supplementary Information). Exclusion criteria included transforma- tion to aggressive B-cell malignancy and previous malignancy within five years of enrollment (unless treated with curative intent). For full inclusion and exclusion criteria see the Online Supplementary Information. During recruitment, the protocol was amended to permit inclu- sion of patients with progressive Binet stage A disease and to exclude 2L patients (due to slow recruitment). All 2L patients recruited before this amendment were included in the final analy- sis, as tumor response in this patient subpopulation was a second- ary study endpoint; however, as the number of 2L patients enrolled was relatively small, there was insufficient power to show statistically significant differences between study treat- ments in this patient subpopulation. Study endpoints The primary endpoint was CR rate (confirmed by bone marrow [BM] biopsy) after C6 in 1L patients. Secondary endpoints includ- ed CR rate after C6 in 2L patients, PFS, overall survival (OS), time to next leukemic treatment, minimal residual disease (MRD), and safety. Response was assessed after C3 and C6 as per iwCLL 2008 guidelines. Response was also assessed in the R-Clb arm at C12, with treatment being discontinued for patients showing evidence of CR during C7-C12. ',\n"," 'Assessments are detailed in the Online Supplementary Information. Safety Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs v4.0 and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v17.0. Statistical analysis Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients). The safety population included all randomized patients who received treatment. For 1L patients, the between-arm difference in response rates was tested using a one-sided continuity-corrected χ test. A two- sided continuity-corrected χ test assessed between-arm differ- ences in overall response rates (ORRs) and molecular responses. PFS and OS were summarized by Kaplan–Meier estimates and compared viathe log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con- fidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on the Cox propor- tional hazard model, with and without baseline Binet stage as a covariate. Results Patients The study was conducted between 23 February 2010 and 31 March 2014. Of the 357 patients in the ITT popu- lation, comprising 241 1L patients (R-B, n=121; R-Clb, n=120) and 116 2L patients (R-B, n=57; R-Clb, n=59), 355 received treatment (R-B, n=177; R-Clb, n=178). Ninety- five patients (27%) withdrew from treatment during the study (Figure 1). Overall, 92/120 (76.7%) 1L patients treated with R-B and 97/120 (80.8%) 1L patients treated with R-Clb received six cycles of rituximab; 92 (76.7%) and 57 (47.5%) received six cycles of B and Clb, respectively. Twelve (10.0%) patients treated with R-Clb received 12 cycles of Clb. The median number of R, B and Clb doses was six for each. The median (interquartile range) dose of rituximab was 4780.5 mg (4222.5-5346.5) in 1L patients treated with R-B and 5028.5 mg (4546.0-5349.0) in 1L patients treated with R-Clb. In total, 6/121 (5.0%) patients treated with R-B and 2/120 (1.7%) patients treated with R- Clb had a reduction or delay in their treatment schedule due to treatment-emergent toxicities. Baseline characteristics were balanced in the 1L popula- tion (Table 1; baseline characteristics for all patients are presented in Online Supplementary Table S1). Deletion of 17p was not an exclusion criterion due to a lack of efficacy data relating to 17p deletion for the treatment combina- tions used at the time of study design. Thus, 13 1L patients (R-B, 10; R-Clb, 3) with 17p deletion were includ- ed. Median follow-up was 23.5 months (R-B) and 23.3 months (R-Clb). ',\n"," 'Median age in 1L patients was 72 years in both treatment arms; the majority of patients were aged 65 years or more. The median number of comorbidities (active medical conditions) in 1L patients was three in both arms (Table 1); the most common comorbidities were vascular disorders and metabolism disorders affect- ing 49% and 37% of patients, respectively (Online Supplementary Table S2). The great majority of all patients in the study (including 2L patients) used concomitant medication during the study (R-B, 96%; R-Clb, 94%).

Colony-stimulating factors were taken more frequently by patients treated with R-B (111/178 [62.4%] vs. 71/179 [39.7%] for R-Clb). ECOG performance status scores were ≥1 in approximately half the study population. At base- line, 108/177 (61.0%), 56/177 (31.6%) and 4/177 (2.3%) patients treated with R-B, and 102/178 (57.3%), 60/178 (33.7%) and 3/178 (1.7%) patients treated with R-Clb had normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant; and abnor- mal clinically significant calculated creatinine clearance, respectively. Efficacy In 1L patients, the CR rate after C6 was higher with R- B versus R-Clb (24% [n=29/121] vs. 9% [n=11/120]; P=0.002; Table 2). Logistic regression analysis supported the R-B treatment effect after adjusting for baseline covari- ates (odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI 1.77-9.87; P=0.001). None of the covariates had a statistically significant impact on the CR rate.

During the study, 11/121 (9.1%) patients treated with R-B and 22/120 (18.3%) patients treated with R-Clb had a documented intake of any new leukemia treatment. Due to the low numbers, the median time to next leukemic treatment could not be calculated for either treatment arm (log-rank test for com- parison between treatment arms: P=0.037). MRD data were available for 45/50 patients (90%) who had a CR based on the investigator’s assessment and 182/241 patients (76%) overall. BM aspirates were avail- able for 42/45 patients (93%) and 145/182 patients (80%), respectively. MRD-negativity rates at the confirmation-of- response visit (ITT population) were higher for R-B than for R-Clb (41% vs. 13%; Table 3). In 1L patients with a CR after C6, MRD-negativity rates at the confirmation-of- response visit were higher in the R-B group than in the R- Clb group (66% vs. 36%). A similar pattern was seen in those with a CR or PR according to investigator’s assess- ment (53% vs. 18%). Efficacy results in 2L patients are presented in the Online Supplementary Information. Safety Safety results are presented for the pooled population (1L and 2L patients). AEs were similar between arms (R-B, 98%; R-Clb, 97%; Table 4). The most common AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) were ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ (R-B, 75%; R-Clb, 64%); the most com- monly reported AE was neutropenia (R-B, 56%; R-Clb, 49%). ',\n"," 'AEs in the SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue dis- orders’ were more frequent in the R-B versus R-Clb arm (36% vs. 23%), driven by a higher incidence of rash (16% vs. 5%). Grade ≥3 AEs were higher with R-B (75%) than R-Clb (64%), mainly due to a higher incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) of the SOC ‘infections and infestations’. The most common grade ≥3 AEs were of the SOC ‘blood and lym- phatic system disorders’ (R-B, 56%; R-Clb, 47%). SAEs were experienced by 41% (R-B) and 32% (R-Clb) of patients, and were most frequently of the SOC ‘infections and infestations’ (R-B, 19%; R-Clb, 8%; Table 4). Rituximab-related AEs were experienced by 81% (R-B) and 73% (R-Clb) of patients. B/Clb-related AEs were reported for 92% (R-B) and 80% (R-Clb) of patients. Drug- related AEs (rituximab, B, and Clb) were most commonly of the SOC ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’. AEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were experienced by 18% (R-B) and 11% (R-Clb) of patients. AEs leading to dis- continuation of B or Clb were reported for 19% and 18% of patients, respectively. In 1L patients, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were experienced by 22 R-B patients (18%) and 14 R-Clb patients (12%). Overall, 65 patients died (R-B, n=30, 17%; R-Clb, n=35, 20%) due to CLL (R-B, n=14, 8%; R-Clb, n=20, 11%) and AEs (R-B, n=16, 9%; R-Clb, n=14, 8%). Cause of death was missing for one patient (R-Clb arm). AEs leading to death were infection (n=4 per arm), acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1 per arm), other neoplasm (R-Clb, n=1), and other causes (R-B, n=11; R-Clb, n=8). Treatment-related AEs leading to death included thrombocytopenia, neutropenic sepsis and febrile neutropenia (n=1 each) in the 1L population and multi-organ failure, pneumonia, acute myeloid leukemia and sepsis (n=1 each) in the 2L population. Discussion R-FC is the standard 1L treatment for medically-fit patients with CLL. However, this regimen can cause sig- nificant myelosuppression and high rates of early and late infections, especially in elderly patients who may have comorbidities and be considered ineligible for fludarabine- based treatment. In MABLE, the efficacy and safety of R- B and R-Clb were investigated in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients. B is an established treatment for CLL, and a previous phase III study of B versusClb in treatment-naïve patients demonstrated improved CR rates and median PFS with B. ',\n"," '12,13 R combined with chemotherapeutic agents pro- longs OS in previously untreated, medically fit CLL patients. 16,17  In unfit patients, survival was improved by the addition of G to Clb. Among 1L patients in MABLE, the rates of CR and of CR with MRD-negativity were higher for R-B than for R- Clb. ORRs were similar in the two arms. Whereas the CR rate in 1L R-Clb patients in MABLE (9%) was comparable with that in R-Clb patients in the phase III CLL11 study (7%), the ORR for R-Clb-treated patients was higher in MABLE than in CLL11 (86% vs. 58%). Two explanations for this might be the different Clb doses used (MABLE, 10 -S. Michallet et al. 702 haematologica | 2018; 103(4) Table 3.

Earlier phase II studies in elderly CLL patients treated 1L with R-Clb reported CR rates of 10-17% and ORRs of 82-84%. ',\n"," '8,9 The CLL2M trial, a phase II study of CLL patients treated 1L with R-B, at the same B dosage as the current study, reported a CR rate of 23% and an ORR of 88%. In 1L patients in the study reported herein, the median PFS of 39.6 months in the R-B arm was significantly longer (by 10 months) than the value in the R-Clb arm. This result is similar to the median PFS of 43.2 months achieved in fit CLL patients treated with R-B in the CLL10 study, and is consistent with the findings of the CLL2M study, which enrolled fit and unfit 1L patients and report- ed a median event-free survival in R-B-treated patients of 33.9 months. The CLL2M study did not select patients by fitness, but a substantial proportion could be considered unfit based on age, Binet stage, and renal impairment. MABLE, 33% of the 1L patients were Binet stage C and the median age was 72 years. The PFS result in the R-Clb arm in MABLE was almost twice as long as that in CLL11 (29.9 vs. 15.4 months), however, as noted above, a direct comparison of these studies is limited by differences in Clb doses and patient fitness. In MABLE, 1L patients with CR had higher MRD-nega- tivity rates with R-B versus R-Clb, indicating a greater depth of response with R-B. Of note, MRD was assessed primarily in BM from patients with CR based on the investigator’s assessment, whereas in CLL11 and previous phase II studies, MRD was measured in peripheral blood ([PB] or BM) from all patients. 7,8,10 One phase II study reported a MRD-negativity rate of 12.5% (2/16 patients) using BM aspirates from R-Clb-treated patients who achieved a CR/unconfirmed CR. Median OS was not significantly different between treatment arms in 1L patients in MABLE and was not reached in previous phase II studies of R-B and R-Clb, 7-9  in the CLL11 and COMPLEMENT-1 studies. 11,19 At current follow-up reported for CLL11 and COMPLEMENT-1, no significant OS benefit was observed for G-Clb versus R-Clb or ofatumumab plus Clb (Ofa-Clb) versus Clb, respectively, 11,19 whereas a significant improvement was observed for G-Clb versusClb alone. Further observation is required to determine if there is an OS benefit with  G-Clb versusR-Clb or Ofa-Clb versusClb. ',\n"," 'Safety profiles (for pooled 1L and 2L patients) were sim- ilar for R-Clb and R-B, with no new or clinically relevant safety signals, and events were as expected for CLL patients receiving immunochemotherapy. 7-9  Incidences of all-grade AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs were sim- ilar across arms. Grade ≥3 AE incidence was slightly high- er with R-B versusR-Clb, driven by a higher incidence of Rituximab plus bendamustine or chlorambucil in CLL haematologica | 2018; 103(4) 703 Figure 2.

Few patients in either arm dis- continued therapy due to AEs. Treatment withdrawal due to AEs was reported for 18% of patients receiving 1L R-B and 12% receiving R-Clb. As previously noted, the results of the CLL11 study show that, in unfit CLL patients, G-Clb was associated with higher response rates and longer PFS than R-Clb, with more frequent MRD eradication and an acceptable toxicity profile. In addition, current guidelines, (European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network), recommend Clb in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody as standard 1L therapy in unfit CLL patients. 20,21 However, in MABLE and previous studies, R-B was associated with a good response rate and improved PFS compared with R-Clb. Currently, evidence to guide the choice between R-B and G-Clb in 1L unfit patients with CLL is limited, although a recent meta- analysis of PFS and OS results in five studies showed a trend towards better efficacy for G-Clb than R-B; how- ever, the difference was not significant despite a signifi- cant difference between G-Clb and other comparators such as R-Clb, Ofa-Clb, Clb, and fludarabine. A random- ized trial comparing these combinations could resolve this question. Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Since we relied only on investigator assessments of tumor response to evaluate efficacy, and did not include assess- ments by an independent review committee, this might have introduced a potential bias in the efficacy results. Comparison of our results with those of other studies in CLL patients is potentially complicated because the selec- tion of patients based on fitness was based on a judgment made by the investigator that the patients were not eligi- ble for fludarabine, according to a set of pre-defined crite- -S.

However, a recent randomized study comparing the efficacy of ibruti- nib with Clb used an age cut-off of 65 years as the only criterion for selecting “older” patients, and did not carry out any assessment of comorbidities.

Indeed, these agents have shown promising efficacy when combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (including rituximab) in the relapsed/refractory CLL setting, 24-29  and are now being evaluated in 1L. Furthermore, additional safety data for 1L B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors are required. In March 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration alerted healthcare pro- fessionals about safety concerns with idelalisib when used in combination with rituximab or R-B in CLL and follicu- lar lymphoma. This was related to a high rate of viral and fungal infections that led the sponsor to discontinue six trials. However, given the economic burden associated with new agents and the fact that BCR inhibitors are not yet available in many European countries, immunochemother- apy combinations are likely to continue to be valuable treat- ment options for 1L patients with CLL. In conclusion, in fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients, 1L R-B treatment significantly improved CR rates and medi- an PFS versusR-Clb, and increased MRD-negativity rates, with no new safety signals reported. R-B may be a valu- able 1L option for fludarabine-ineligible CLL patients and this combination continues to be widely used in clinical practice in Europe, reinforcing the interest of this large randomized study.

Despite  multiple treatment options available, responses in relapsed  disease are typically incomplete and are of relatively short  duration, and therapy is commonly complicated by cytope- nias and infections [1 – 3]. A more targeted approach in the  treatment of CLL could have the benefi t of high effi cacy with  low toxicity. Th e phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is  known to be a central mechanism by which CLL lymphocytes  survive and evade apoptosis. Constitutive activation of  AKT promotes CLL lymphocyte survival, while inhibition of  the AKT pathway induces CLL lymphocyte death [4]. Because  of these fi ndings, we sought to evaluate the eff ect of pharma- cologic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells. Perifosine is an alkylphospholipid that was shown to  inhibit phosphorylation of AKT by blocking the membrane  localization of AKT and thus interfering with the interac- tion of PI3K with AKT [5]. ',\n"," 'myeloma and Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia,  two B-cell malignancies [6 – 8]. In these B-cell lymphoprolif- erative disorders, effi cacy of perifosine was linked to its inhi- bition of signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because  CLL is a related B-cell malignancy that relies on the PI3K/ AKT pathway for viability, we hypothesized that perifosine  would have anti-CLL activity mediated through its inhibition  of AKT phosphorylation. Materials and methods  Clinical study design and subjects  Patients with histologically confi rmed relapsed or refrac- tory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who  required therapy were eligible for this phase II clinical trial  at Duke University Medical Center. Th e primary objective  was to evaluate the response rate of perifosine in patients  with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. Secondary objec- tives included assessing toxicity, evaluating overall survival  and event-free survival, and performing laboratory-based  correlates of clinical effi cacy. Eligibility criteria included age 18 years of age, Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  of 0 – 2, creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min, and aspartate  aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  and total bilirubin 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Abstract  Because of the importance of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase  (PI3K)/AKT pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we  evaluated in vitro cytotoxicity induced by perifosine, an AKT  inhibitor, in CLL lymphocytes and found that the mean 50%  eff ective dose (ED  ) was 313 nM. We then performed a phase  II trial of perifosine in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL  to assess response, outcomes, toxicity and ex vivo correlative  measures. After 3 months of treatment, six of eight patients  showed stable disease, one achieved a partial response and  one had progressive disease. Median event-free survival and  overall survival in all patients treated were 3.9 and 9.7 months. Adverse events included hematologic, infectious/fever, pain,  gastrointestinal and constitutional toxicities. Unexpectedly,  AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes from treated patients  was not correlated with response. Additionally, perifosine did  not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. Perifosine is cytotoxic to CLL cells in vitro , and largely induces  stabilized disease in vivo , with an AKT-independent mechanism.

Th ese included bone marrow  biopsy and aspirate, cross-sectional imaging of the neck,  chest, abdomen and pelvis, immunoglobulin heavy chain  variable (IGHV) gene mutation status determination, fl ow  cytometry for ZAP70 and CD38, interphase cytogenetics for  11q23, 12cen, 13q14 and 17p13 using fl uorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetics. Prog- nostic markers were determined by clinical laboratories at  Duke University [9], but in rare cases of missing data, some  prognostic markers were measured in the research labora- tory as described in the “ In vitro evaluation of perifosine ”  section below. Th e Duke University institutional review board (IRB)  approved the protocol and all study participants provided  written informed consent. Th e clinical study was registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00873457). Target accrual was  based on the estimated patient accrual rate at our single  institution as well as estimates for statistical confi dence. Th ere was no offi cial stopping rule or interim analysis,  although the protocol stipulated consideration of stopping  the clinical trial early if there were one or less responders  in the fi rst 12 accrued patients. Perifosine was supplied by  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Clinical study treatment plan  Perifosine was administered at 50 mg orally, twice daily on a  continuous treatment schedule, for up to six 28-day cycles. Patients were instructed to take perifosine with food. Dose  modifi cations were prescribed for persistent grade 2 and  for grade 3/4 adverse events. For persistent grade 2 adverse  events, perifosine was reduced to once daily dosing. ',\n"," 'For  grade 3/4 adverse events, perifosine was held for at least  1 week, and restarted once the toxicity improved to grade 1  or returned to baseline. Supportive care, including antibiotic  prophylaxis, antiemetic prophylaxis, diarrhea management  and hyperuricemia prophylaxis, were at the discretion of the  treating physician. Patients were followed monthly, with physical exami- nations, blood counts and manual leukocyte diff erential. Interim responses were evaluated after three cycles of  therapy with evaluation and comparison of blood counts  and cross-sectional imaging to those obtained prior to  therapy initiation. Final responses were evaluated after six  cycles of therapy. Response to therapy was classifi ed based  on the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic  Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria [10]. Toxicities were documented  according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version  3.0). Hematologic toxicities were also evaluated using the  iwCLL criteria [10]. Ex vivo correlative studies  Laboratory-based correlative studies were performed to  evaluate ex vivo CLL lymphocytes for biomarkers associ- ated with clinical response. For cytotoxicity, apoptosis and  immunoblot assays, CLL cells were isolated and purifi ed, as  described previously [11]. For fl ow cytometry assessment of  phosphorylated protein expression, we used whole blood. Plasma was used to measure perifosine concentration. Between 10 and 50 mL of blood was collected prior to initia- tion of therapy (cycle 1 day 1), on cycle 1 day 8, on cycle 4 day  1 and at completion of perifosine. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using the MTS [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2- (4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous  One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega). We evaluated  CLL cell apoptosis and death using a caspase-3 activity assay  (EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit #2 - Z-DEVD-R110 Substrate;  Life Technologies) and by fl ow cytometric measurement of  Annexin V – fl uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (BD Biosci- ences) expression and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion  (Sigma). Assays were performed as described previously [12]  and according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. We performed phospho-fl ow assays on whole blood col- lected from patients during the clinical study. Six hundred  microliters of whole blood was incubated with BD Lyse/Fix  Buff er, washed with phosphate buff ered saline (PBS) and  permeabilized with BD Perm Buff er III. ',\n"," 'Up to 1 10 6 cells  were combined with antibodies listed below for 30 min and  resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Flow cytom- etry was performed as described below. When adequate CLL lymphocytes were available, we  assessed total AKT and phosphorylated AKT using immu- noblots. Cells were lysed with RIPA buff er (Cell Signaling  Technology), cOmplete Mini ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied  Science) and Tyr and Ser/Th r phosphatase inhibitor cock- tail set (Millipore). Cell lysates (50 μ g for phospho-AKT and  20 μ g for AKT) were electorphoresed and blotted onto poly- vinylidene fl uoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were  blocked and incubated with phospho-AKT (S473) rabbit  polyclonal and AKT rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies  (Cell Signaling Technology). Th e immunoblots were then  incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG), horse- radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody (Cell  Signaling Technology) and SuperSignal (Th ermo Scien- tifi c). We used phospho- or non-phospho-AKT cell extracts  (Cell Signaling Technology) as a positive/normalization  control across immunoblots. Band density was quantifi ed  and expressed as a ratio of phospho-AKT band density to  total AKT band density, and normalized to the cell extract  control band density. Plasma perifosine concentration was determined at  the University of Wisconsin using a reversed-phase liquid  chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry method  described previously [13]. Perifosine in CLL 1069 In vitro evaluation of perifosine  CLL lymphocytes were obtained from patients followed at  the Duke University and the Durham VA Medical Center. Th ese patients were enrolled in IRB-approved research pro- tocols to collect clinical data and primary patient samples. Patients ’ charts were reviewed to collect and/or calculate  certain prognostic information, such as Rai stage at diagno- sis, lymphocyte doubling time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  and β  -microglobulin (B2M). Isolation and purifi cation of CLL lymphocytes and deter- mination of molecular prognostic markers were performed,  as described previously [11]. Perifosine was obtained from  Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Cytotoxicity was measured after  a 3-day incubation of primary CLL cells with serial dilutions  of perifosine in Hybridoma SFM medium (Gibco) using the  MTS assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Pro- liferation Assay, Promega) and fractional cytotoxicity was  determined, all as described before [14]. ',\n"," 'Th ereafter, dose – response curves and the concentration eff ective at killing  50% of CLL cells (ED  ) were calculated. Phospho-fl ow cytometry was performed to determine  the intracellular content of phosphorylated protein kinases  in purifi ed CLL lymphocytes. CLL cells were evaluated at  a 0 h time point and after 1 h of incubation in serum-free  medium with or without anti-IgM (20 μ g/mL goat anti- human IgM; Southern Biotech), perifosine (10 μ M) and/ or LY294002 (25 μ M; Invitrogen). Th e concentration of  perifosine was chosen based on in vitro testing in multiple  myeloma cells [7]. Th e anti-IgM was added for the last  10 min of incubation. One million cells per condition were  fi xed with BD Phosfl ow Lyse/Fix Buff er III (BD Biosciences)  and stored at 80 ° C. After thawing all replicate samples,  the cells were permeabilized with BD Phosfl ow Perm  Buff er (BD Biosciences) and were stained with antibod- ies to CD5, CD20, CD19 and a phosphoprotein, as out- lined in Supplementary Table I available online at http:// informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013. 824080. Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickin- son LSRII fl ow cytometer. Analysis of fl ow cytometry results  was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.). CLL cells were identifi ed based on forward and side scat- ter characteristics as well as co-expression of CD5, CD19 and  CD20. Phosphoprotein content was evaluated using a “ fl uo- rescence minus one ” (FMO) approach. For each experiment,  the mean fl uorescence intensity (MFI) in the PE channel  without the test antibody was subtracted from the MFI with  a test antibody. For in vitro experiments, the change in MFI  under each experimental condition was normalized to base- line MFI using the equation: normalized MFI [(test MFI  FMO MFI)/(test MFI at time 0 FMO MFI)]. Statistical analysis  Patients completing three and six cycles of perifosine were  evaluated for responses. Event-free survival (EFS) was  defi ned as the time from initiation of perifosine to disease  progression, subsequent treatment or death. Overall survival  (OS) was defi ned as the time from initiation of perifosine to  death [10]. All treated patients were evaluated for toxicity,  EFS and OS. ',\n"," 'Kaplan – Meier analyses and graphs of EFS and OS were  performed using the survival package in R [15]. Follow-up  time was defi ned as time from start of therapy to death or  the current time (if still living). Dose – response curves and  evaluation of ED  were performed using the drc pack- age in R [16]. Statistical comparison of phospho-AKT in  CLL lymphocytes was performed using the paired t -test. Pearson ’ s correlation was used to evaluate for associations  between continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum  test or Kruskal – Wallis test were used to assess for associa- tions between discrete variables and continuous variables,  respectively. A p -value of 0.05 was considered signifi cant. Th ese statistical analyses were performed in the statistical  environment R, version 2.11.1. Results  Perifosine induces in vitro CLL cell toxicity  Perifosine has previously been evaluated for its in vitro eff ect  on B-cell malignancies, such as multiple myeloma [6 – 8]. We evaluated the extent to which perifosine induces in vitro  cytotoxicity in purifi ed CLL lymphocytes, since activation  of the PI3K/AKT pathway is known to promote cell survival  in this malignancy [4]. Twenty-six primary CLL cell samples  obtained from patients not undergoing therapy were tested  for cell viability using the colorimetric MTS assay after  incubation with a range of concentrations of perifosine. the samples with evaluable data, 12 samples had mutated  IGHV, while 11 samples were unmutated. Twenty samples  had low CD38 ( 30%) expression and six samples had high  CD38 expression. Eleven samples had low ZAP70 ( 20%)  expression and 15 samples had high ZAP70 expression. Using the D ö hner classifi cation for interphase cytogenetics  [17], eight samples had 13q deletion, six had normal cyto- genetics, three had trisomy 12, four had 11q deletion and  two had 17p deletion. As seen in Figure 1, perifosine induces CLL lymphocyte  toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean ED  313 74 nM (standard error). ',\n"," 'Th e calculated in vitro ED  perifosine in these samples had no signifi cant correlation to  molecular prognostic markers or to other prognostic mark- ers such as Rai stage, lymphocyte doubling time, serum LDH  or serum B2M level (Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal – Wallis  test for discrete variables; Pearson ’ s correlation test for  continuous variables). Th us, perifosine appears to induce  cytotoxicity in vitro in CLL cells throughout the spectrum of  biologically aggressive or indolent markers. Patient characteristics in CLL perifosine clinical trial  Because of the encouraging results demonstrating that  sub-micromolar concentrations of perifosine induce cyto- toxicity in CLL lymphocytes in vitro , we initiated a phase  II clinical trial to evaluate the effi cacy and toxicity of 50 mg  of perifosine administered orally twice daily for 6 months  in relapsed and/or refractory CLL/SLL. Th is dosing sched- ule was selected based on results from a phase II study of  single agent perifosine in Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia  [6]. Our goal accrual was 30 evaluable patients. However,  we discontinued the study early because of low objective  1070 D. Friedman et al. patients treated with perifosine, four had normal interphase  FISH cytogenetics, one had 13q deletion, two had trisomy  12, one had 11q deletion and eight had 17p deletion (D ö hner  classifi cation). Of 14 patients ’ CLL cells that could be tested  for conventional cytogenetics, 11 had complex and/or addi- tional karyotypic abnormalities not detected by the FISH  assay. Th us, either by clinical history or by molecular prog- nostic markers, patients with CLL enrolled in the perifosine  clinical trial had high-risk and aggressive disease. Safety and dose reductions  All treated patients were evaluated for toxicity. Th e adverse  and serious adverse events are shown in Table II.

Nine patients were previously  treated on other clinical trials. Fourteen of the patients on  this study were refractory to prior purine analog based che- motherapy regimens, having not responded or progressed  within 6 months of completion of those therapies. Patients with CLL treated in this clinical trial also had  high-risk molecular prognostic markers.

Perifosine therapy was  associated with metabolic toxicities, such as hyperglycemia  (four events, one grade 3), hyperbilirubinemia (two events,  one grade 3) and hyponatremia (two events, one grade 4). Th ere were 10 episodes of musculoskeletal pain (all grades  1 and 2). ',\n"," 'With regard to hematologic toxicities, 12 patients  began the study with Rai stage 3 or 4 CLL, so baseline anemia  and thrombocytopenia were common. Using iwCLL criteria  to grade hematologic toxicity [10], eight events of grade 1 and  2 anemia occurred, and 16 events of grade 1 and 2 thrombo- cytopenia occurred. Eleven events of neutropenia occurred  (two grade 3 events). Nine episodes of grade 3 or 4 infection  or febrile neutropenia were documented, but there was only  one microbiologically confi rmed infection that began during  perifosine treatment ( Escherichia coli sepsis). Two patients required dose reductions and delays due to  toxicity. One patient developed neutropenia, and perifosine  was held for 1 week then restarted at daily dosing. Another  patient developed anemia and required transfusions, and  perifosine was held for 2 weeks, then restarted at daily  dosing. We noted other eff ects of perifosine. Th ese included an  improvement in thrombocytopenia (isolated from changes  in hemoglobin or leukocyte count) in three patients, rash in  two patients, and reduction in malignant pleural eff usions in  one patient. Patient response to perifosine therapy  At a median follow-up time of 290 days (range 19 – 1142  days), 15 patients had died and one remains alive. As seen  in Figure 2, by 1 year of initiation of the perifosine study, all  treated patients progressed, received subsequent therapy or  died. Median EFS was 119 days (3.9 months), and median OS  was 290 days (9.7 months). Responses are outlined in Table III. Eight patients did  not complete 3 months of therapy. Of the eight patients who  were evaluated at 3 months, six had stable disease, one had  a partial response and one had progression of disease. Only  one patient completed 6 months of therapy, and had stable  disease at the conclusion of therapy. Early discontinuation of  therapy was most often due to insuffi cient response (56%) or  disease progression/transformation (19%). Other clinical trials of novel agents that inhibit the PI3K/ AKT pathway in CLL have noted increasing lymphocyto- sis accompanied by a reduction of lymph node size [18],  thought to be due to redistribution from the lymph node  microenvironment to the blood [19]. ',\n"," 'In six patients, we also  saw a rise in circulating leukocyte count. Th is was accompa- nied by an initial reduction in palpable lymphadenopathy  in four patients, while the remaining two did not have pal- pable lymph nodes at the start of treatment. In one patient,  this initial increase in lymphocytosis was accompanied by  a fever, reduction in serum LDH and resolution of thrombo- cytopenia. By 3 months of therapy, this patient had progres- sion of lymphadenopathy on computed tomography (CT)  scan and a reduction in circulating CLL cells. Correlative studies in CLL perifosine clinical trial  As a secondary aim, we measured ex vivo apoptosis, cytotox- icity and phosphorylation of AKT in CLL cells obtained from  patients undergoing therapy with perifosine. We hypothe- sized that in patients responding to perifosine therapy, there  would be induction of CLL cell apoptosis and inhibition of  AKT phosphorylation. We found no consistent eff ect of therapy on perifosine- induced CLL cytotoxicity [Figure 3(A)] or on CLL apoptosis  [Figure 3(B)], measured by MTS assay, caspase-3 activity  and Annexin V/PI staining (data not shown).

',\n"," 'Perifosine in CLL 1073 Discussion  In the phase II trial assessing the effi cacy of perifosine as a  single agent for CLL therapy, we have found that perifosine  mainly stabilizes disease in a heavily pretreated and highly  refractory population of patients with CLL, and that this  eff ect is not associated with in vivo alterations in AKT phos- phorylation of CLL lymphocytes. In our laboratory-based  experiments, we demonstrated that perifosine has cytotoxic  activity against CLL lymphocytes in vitro that is independent  of inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Despite observing in vitro cytotoxicity of CLL cells with  perifosine in the nanomolar range, we did not fi nd signifi - cant in vivo clinical responses. Th is discrepancy could be  due to experimental conditions that may not fully represent  the in vivo setting. For example, when fetal bovine serum  (10%) was added to standard medium, the mean ED  rose  to 11 1.5 μ M (standard error; n 3), implying that protein  binding may diminish perifosine ’ s activity. Notably, the  plasma concentration reached after 1 week of therapy (4042  ng/mL) is equivalent to 8.75 μ M, a lower concentration than  this in vitro ED  result. Even if higher doses are necessary to  induce clinical responses, such an approach has previously  been demonstrated to cause greater toxicities (specifi cally  gastrointestinal and fatigue) [20]. More rapid achievement  of steady state concentrations can be achieved with loading  doses, but are associated with dose-limiting toxicities, espe- cially in the loading period [22]. In the phase II study of peri- fosine in Waldenstr ö m macroglobulinemia, 43% of patients  required dose reductions from 150 to 100 mg/day due to tox- icities [6]. Th us, known toxicities limited our dosing plan. A high-risk patient population with few treatment options  was treated in the trial. Th e oral administration of therapy and  the low incidence of cytopenias in other perifosine clinical tri- als attracted patients who were older and had more advanced  disease. Notably, most patients achieved disease stabiliza- tion with perifosine after progressing on other highly active  therapeutic regimens and other clinical trials, including fl u- darabine, bendamustine and fl avopiridol. Discontinuation of  We also assessed plasma perifosine concentration at the  specifi ed sample collection time points. ',\n"," 'As seen in Figure  3(D), after 1 week of perifosine treatment, patients reached  the expected plasma concentration for the dose based on  prior phase I studies [20]. Th e median concentration at that  time was 4042 ng/mL. For patients continuing on therapy  with subsequent blood collection, the median perifosine  concentration was 6058 ng/mL. Th ere was no correlation  between plasma perifosine concentration and clinical  responses or adverse events. In vitro cytotoxicity by perifosine is not related  to inhibition of AKT phosphorylation  Given prior reports documenting that perifosine inhibits  AKT phosphorylation and the PI3K/AKT pathway in multiple  myeloma [7], it was unexpected that perifosine treatment did  not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes in the  clinical trial. Th erefore, we performed in vitro experiments  to directly evaluate perifosine-induced suppression of AKT  phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. CLL cells up- regulate signaling via the PI3K/AKT pathway upon stimula- tion of the B-cell receptor by IgM cross-linking [Figure 4(A)]. We evaluated AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells after IgM  cross-linking with no drug compared to that with the addition  of perifosine or LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway  [21]. LY294002 signifi cantly decreased AKT phosphorylation  (pS473) in fi ve CLL samples after IgM cross-linking, whereas  perifosine did not [Figure 4(A)]. We observed no signifi cant  change in AKT phosphorylation with either drug without IgM  cross-linking (paired t -test, data not shown). Despite having  no eff ect on AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells, perifosine did  induce cytotoxicity in these samples tested, with ED  values  ranging from 578 nM to 1.545 μ M. Interestingly, we found that perifosine signifi cantly  increased phosphorylation of MEK in CLL lymphocytes  [Figure 4(B)], similar to fi ndings previously reported in  multiple myeloma cell lines [7]. Th ese fi ndings underscore  the diff erential eff ects of perifosine across diff erent types of  malignant B-cells.  0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Baseline IgM IgM + LY294002 IgM + Perifosine p = 0.042 p = 0.002 (A) (B) Baseline IgM IgM + LY294002 IgM + Perifosine p = 0.018 Figure 4.

Given  the impressive responses to PI3K-delta isoform inhibitors in  relapsed CLL [18], the limited clinical effi cacy of perifosine  precludes its further development in this setting. Overall, perifosine was well tolerated. Notable non- hematologic and non-infectious toxicities were gastroin- testinal (nausea, diarrhea, dehydration) and pain (mostly  musculoskeletal), which were typically grade 1 or 2 and were  anticipated based on clinical evaluations of perifosine in  other malignancies [8,23]. Th ere was a varied eff ect of peri- fosine on hematologic parameters: in some cases cytopenias  improved dramatically, while in others, profound throm- bocytopenia and anemia requiring transfusions occurred. Fevers and infections did occur, but it is unclear whether  these were due to underlying immunosuppression or a direct  eff ect of perifosine. In one case, fever coincided with initia- tion of perifosine and the improvement of anemia, thrombo- cytopenia and neutropenia, suggesting that it may have been  due to therapy itself, not an infection. Perifosine has been found to have a variety of mecha- nisms of action independent of its eff ect on AKT phospho- rylation [24 – 27]. Th ese include alterations of membrane  lipid rafts and associated death receptors (such as tumor  necrosis factor [TNF]-related apoptosis-inducing ligand  [TRAIL]-receptor 1 and 2), induction of apoptosis via sup- pression of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, inhibition of  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and  induction of autophagy. Other cellular eff ects of perifosine  include induction of the mitogen activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of MEK [7],  which we also noted in our experiments. ',\n"," 'We did not evalu- ate whether these other potential mechanisms explain the  perifosine-induced in vitro cytotoxicity observed in cul- tured CLL cells. Th ese series of experiments, while not yielding a novel  therapeutic agent for CLL, do add to growing opportunities  for ex vivo monitoring of pharmacodynamic endpoints in  leukemia [18,28]. Th rough fl ow cytometry of whole blood,  we could evaluate known surface markers of CLL, as well as  phosphorylation of various members of second messenger  systems, using small numbers of circulating CLL cells. Th is is  important, as patients with CLL may paradoxically develop  lymphopenia with disease progression or after multiple  therapeutic regimens. Th us, in a series of translational experiments to evalu- ate perifosine in CLL, we demonstrated a cytotoxic eff ect in  vitro but only stabilization of disease in vivo . Th e eff ects we  observed were not associated with inhibition of AKT phos- phorylation, a mechanism previously reported for perifos- ine in other B-cell malignancies. Our study highlights the  value of incorporating ex vivo pharmacodynamic monitor- ing during therapy with novel agents for CLL to confi rm  inhibition of the target and/or to identify biomarkers of  therapy response.

Granulocyte  macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was added to  the regimen to determine whether it would improve treatment  effi cacy without increasing toxicity. High risk was defi ned as  at least one of the following: 17p13 - ; 11q22.3 - ; unmutated  IGHV (or use of VH3 – 21) together with elevated expression of  ZAP-70 and/or CD38. ',\n"," 'Treatment was subcutaneous GM-CSF  250 μ g Monday – Wednesday – Friday for 6 weeks from day 1,  subcutaneous alemtuzumab 3 mg – 10 mg – 30 mg from day 3  and then 30 mg Monday – Wednesday – Friday for 4 weeks, and  intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /week) for 4 weeks from day 8. Patients received standard supportive care and were monitored  weekly for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. Using standard  criteria, 31 (94%) patients responded to treatment, with nine  (27%) complete responses (one with persistent cytopenia) and  nine (27%) nodular partial responses. Median progression-free  survival was 13.0 months and time to next treatment was 33.5  months. No patient died during treatment, seven (21%) had  grade 3 – 4 toxicities attributable to treatment, and 10 (30%) had  CMV viremia. Addition of GM-CSF to therapy with alemtuzumab  and rituximab decreased treatment effi cacy and increased the  rate of CMV reactivation compared to a historical control. Keywords: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia , high risk ,  early treatment , alemtuzumab , rituximab , GM-CSF  gene ( IGHV mutation) [2,3], and the expression of CD38 [3]  and ZAP-70 [4]. Th ose patients in whom interphase fl uores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects 17p13 deletions  (17p - ) or 11q22.3 deletions (11q - ) have a signifi cantly poorer  prognosis [1]. Use of unmutated IGHV ( 2% diff erence from  germline sequence) [2,3] and use of VH3 – 21 irrespective of  mutation status [5] are associated with a poorer prognosis. Patients with unmutated IGHV are reported to have a signifi - cantly worse prognosis if CLL cells express CD38 or ZAP-70  [6,7]. Defi ning high-risk earlier-stage CLL in asymptomatic  patients is now feasible, and the challenge is to develop  highly eff ective low-toxicity therapy for this population. Th e current standard of care is to treat patients with CLL  only when they have progressive disease, because conven- tional treatment is not curative, and previous randomized  studies using only chemotherapy showed no survival advan- tage for early treatment [8 – 10]. Fit patients with progressive  CLL are now usually treated with chemoimmunotherapy  (purine analog, cyclophosphamide and rituximab), which  achieves high response rates, prolonged response duration  and increased overall survival [11 – 13]. ',\n"," 'All patients required an Eastern Coopera- tive Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 – 2 and  adequate organ function (serum creatinine 1.5 upper  limit of normal [UNL], total bilirubin 3.0 UNL and serum  aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 3.0 UNL). Exclusion  criteria included any evidence of active autoimmune disease  or active primary malignancy requiring treatment or limiting  expected survival to 2 years. Therapy  Patients were treated for 6 weeks. GM-CSF 250 μ g/day  was given subcutaneously three times a week (Monday – Wednesday – Friday) starting on day 1 of treatment and con- tinued for a total of 6 weeks. Patients received subcutaneous  alemtuzumab with dose escalation (3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg) on  days 3 – 5 of the fi rst week of therapy as tolerated, and then  received 30 mg/day Monday – Wednesday – Friday for the  next 4 weeks. After the fi rst week of therapy, alemtuzumab  could be self-administered at home at the patient ’ s discre- tion. Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 intravenously) was given on  day 8 and then weekly for a total of four doses. Th e fi rst dose  of alemtuzumab and all doses of rituximab were premedi- cated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Patients  received allopurinol (300 mg/day) on days 2 – 15 of therapy. All  patients received prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia  and reactivation of herpes simplex and varicella zoster dur- ing treatment and then for an additional 6 months. Patients  were monitored for CMV reactivation using polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) for viral DNA weekly during treatment  and then monthly for 6 months, and treated whenever CMV  viremia was detected. Response evaluation  Patients were evaluated by physical examination and blood  testing weekly during treatment, then monthly for 6 months,  and then at 9 and 12 months after completing therapy. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 (http://ctep.cancer. gov/). Response to treatment was measured 2 months after  completion of therapy using standard NCI-WG96 criteria  [27]. ',\n"," 'However, these thera- pies can cause signifi cant toxicity and long-term complica- tions, and are considerably less eff ective in patients with p53  dysfunction [13,14]. Th us, early treatment of selected patients  with CLL with a lower burden of disease and high risk of dis- ease progression using eff ective low-toxicity therapy could  decrease exposure to DNA-damaging agents and the risk of  clonal evolution to more aggressive disease. We have previously reported a phase II trial using a  short course of alemtuzumab and rituximab for early treat- ment of patients with high-risk CLL [15]. Th is regimen was  selected because alemtuzumab and rituximab have discrete  targets and diff erent mechanisms of action [16,17], and the  addition of rituximab to alemtuzumab appears to improve  responses, compared to historical results, for patients with  relapsed/refractory CLL [18,19]. Early treatment of patients  GM-CSF in treatment of CLL 477 with high-risk CLL resulted in a 90% response rate, 37%  complete response (CR) rate, median duration of response  of 14.4 months and estimated median time to next treatment  of 4.4 years [15]. Th erapy was well tolerated, and although  cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in three (10%)  patients, only one patient had clinical disease [15]. However,  because of the limited duration of response, additional eff orts  are required to improve the effi cacy of this therapy. Phagocytosis by fi xed macrophages and antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by natural  killer (NK) cells, monocytes and neutrophils are important  mechanisms of action of both rituximab and alemtuzumab,  and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is important  for the activity of alemtuzumab [16,17,20,21]. Both alemtu- zumab and rituximab decrease the circulating neutrophil  count, and alemtuzumab can decrease circulating NK cells  and monocytes [15], while its eff ect on tissue macrophages  is not known. Th us, both alemtuzumab and rituximab could  inhibit ADCC by decreasing eff ector cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM- CSF) promotes proliferation and maturation of neutrophils  and monocytes, and increases diff erentiation of monocytes  to macrophages and dendritic cells [22]. GM-CSF has also  been reported to increase rituximab ADCC of CLL cells by  monocytes in vitro [23]. ',\n"," 'A phase II study using GM-CSF and  rituximab to treat patients with relapsed follicular B cell lym- phoma reported higher overall response and CR rates without  undue toxicity, compared to the historical experience [24]. In addition, limited experience of treatment of patients with  CLL with GM-CSF and rituximab suggests that this therapy is  well tolerated, and it did not have inferior effi cacy compared  to rituximab monotherapy [25]. Th e current published data  thus suggest that the addition of GM-CSF to monoclonal  antibody (mAb) therapy could be safe and eff ective. We hypothesized that treatment with GM-CSF could  increase eff ector cell activity, resulting in improved effi cacy  of therapy with alemtuzumab and rituximab in patients  with CLL. As the initial step in testing this hypothesis, we  conducted a phase II trial of early treatment of patients with  high-risk CLL with GM-CSF, alemtuzumab and rituximab. Th is study showed that the addition of GM-CSF decreased  treatment effi cacy and resulted in higher rates of CMV  reactivation compared to a historical experience with  alemtuzumab and rituximab alone. Methods and materials  Patient selection  Th e study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional  Review Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT00562328), and all patients provided written informed  consent. Sequential patients were evaluated in the Division  of Hematology at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Department  of Hematology/Oncology at Mayo Clinic Arizona from  January 2008 to February 2010. Eligibility required a diagno- sis of CLL by fl ow cytometry on peripheral blood [26], previ- ously untreated early to intermediate clinical stage disease  (Rai 0 – II) that did not fulfi ll criteria for treatment as defi ned  by the National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria  of 1996 (NCI-WG96) [27], and molecular markers predic- tive of a high risk of disease progression. High-risk disease  was defi ned as at least one of the following: (1) 17p13 - by  FISH analysis; (2) 11q22 - by FISH analysis; (3) unmutated  IGHV ( 2% sequence variation from germline) or use of  the VH3 – 21 gene segment irrespective of mutation status  together with expression of ZAP-70 ( 20% cells positive on  fl ow cytometry) and/or CD38 ( 30% cells positive on fl ow  cytometry) [15]. ',\n"," 'Patients dying without documentation of  disease progression were considered to have had tumor pro- gression at the time of their death, unless there was proof of  sustained response. Time to subsequent therapy was defi ned  as the time from the end of active treatment to the time that  subsequent therapy was initiated. Th e distribution of all  time-to-event endpoints was estimated using the method of  Kaplan – Meier [31]. Baseline information of patients enrolled  in this trial was compared to that of patients enrolled in  MC038G using two-sample t -tests (for continuous data) or χ 2  tests (for categorical data). Results  Th irty-three patients were enrolled and are described in  Table I. All patients met eligibility criteria, completed the  treatment regimen protocol, and were evaluated for response  and toxicity.

Th e role of treatment  with alemtuzumab in development of the diff use large B-cell  lymphoma cannot be determined. Alemtuzumab-induced  immunosuppression has been associated with the develop- ment of more aggressive lymphomas, but the reported cases  were EBV positive [32,33]. Th e absence of evidence of EBV  reactivation and the temporal sequence of the complica- tion suggest that this patient ’ s diff use large B-cell lymphoma  could have been present prior to initiation of therapy with  alemtuzumab. A second patient with 17p13 – CLL achieved  PR of 4 months ’ duration. He then failed treatment for pro- gressive disease with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide and  rituximab (FCR) and died from his CLL 10 months later. Eleven additional patients required subsequent treatment  and received FCR ( n 6), pentostatin, cyclophosphamide  and rituximab (PCR) ( n 1), bendamustine and rituximab  ( n 1), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and  prednisone ( n 2) and rituximab ( n 1). Neutrophil and monocyte counts  GM-CSF decreased treatment-induced neutropenia (Figure 3)  but not alemtuzumab-mediated monocytopenia (Figure 4),  compared to our previous study of early treatment of patients  with high-risk CLL with alemtuzumab and rituximab [15]. ',\n"," 'Testing for residual disease  BM biopsies of the six patients achieving a CR/CRi with no  morphological evidence of CLL were studied with IHC for  residual disease. Th e three patients with IHC-negative CR  had a longer PFS (not reached at 25 months). Serial high- sensitivity fl ow cytometry for MRD in blood was performed  during treatment and then until disease progression in  29 patients. Seventeen (59%) patients achieved at least one  negative MRD test during treatment, and 12 (41%) had nega- tive results after completion of therapy. However, only four  (14%) of these patients were still MRD-negative at 2 months  after completion of therapy, with two having evidence of resid- ual disease on IHC examination of the BM (PFS 19 months and  not reached at 19 months) and two having an IHC-negative BM  (PFS not reached at 25 months). Th e longest duration of MRD- negative status was 9 months after completion of therapy. Addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and rituximab  To assess whether GM-CSF improved the effi cacy of alemtu- zumab and rituximab for early treatment of high-risk CLL,  we compared the results of this trial (MC0785) to a preced- ing trial (MC038G) that used similar eligibility criteria [15]. As seen in Table II, there were signifi cantly more patients  on the MC0785 trial with unmutated IGHV . In contrast, the  higher number of patients on the MC038G with 17p13 – (30%  vs. 12%) did not represent a signifi cant diff erence ( p 0.12). Use of GM-CSF was associated with a signifi cantly higher  rate of CMV reactivation (30% vs. 3%, p 0.007), but only  one patient in each trial had symptomatic CMV reactivation  requiring hospitalization. Th ere were no other signifi cant  diff erences in toxicities. Use of GM-CSF was associated with  a similar overall response rate (94%, 95% CI: 80 – 99% vs. 90%,  95% CI: 73 – 98%) and PFS (13.0, 95% CI: 9.4 – NR vs. 11.6, 95%  CI: 7.2 – 19.3 months) (Figure 1), but lower CR rates (24%,  95% CI: 11 – 42% vs. 37%, 95% CI: 19 – 56%) and time to next  treatment (33.5, 95% CI: 25.5 – 37.6 vs. 43, 95% CI: 29.4 – 66.3  months) (Figure 2). ',\n"," 'Discussion  Early treatment of high-risk CLL could be benefi cial if the  highest-risk patients could be accurately identifi ed and  treated with safe and eff ective non-genotoxic therapy. this study we showed that the addition of GM-CSF did not  improve the effi cacy of alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy  for early treatment of high-risk CLL and increased the rate of  CMV reactivation. Th e rationale for using GM-CSF was to enhance ADCC by  increasing the effi cacy of monocyte – macrophage – dendritic  cells and preventing mAb-induced neutropenia. Although  neutrophil counts were well maintained, there was no  increase in circulating monocyte counts or treatment effi - cacy. GM-CSF was used at the dose recommended by the  manufacturers based on their experience in vaccine and  immunotherapy trials. A higher GM-CSF dose could have  480 C. Zent et al. Figure 4.

Use of GM-CSF could have adversely altered monocyte – macrophage function in the patients treated in this study. ',\n"," 'Patients with CLL have recently been shown to have increased  levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are media- tors of cancer tolerance [34], and production of monocyte- derived survival factors such as soluble CD14, which have  been shown to increase CLL cell survival in vitro [35]. We have previously shown that patients enrolled in this  study had an increased baseline percentage of immu- nosuppressive CD14 monocytes with reduced human  leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression compared  to healthy controls, and higher percentages of these  CD14 HLA-DR lo/neg cells predicted signifi cantly shorter  PFS [36]. Th ese data suggest that GM-CSF could stimulate an  GM-CSF in treatment of CLL 481 Table II.

',\n"," 'immunosuppressive monocyte – macrophage – dendritic cell  response in patients with CLL that decreases ADCC and thus  impairs the response to alemtuzumab and rituximab. Th e use of GM-CSF could decrease the risk of infection. However, we observed a three-fold increase in the rate of  CMV reactivation compared to the previous trial [15]. Th is  fi nding is compatible with previous reports suggesting that  G-CSF could increase the risk of CMV reactivation in patients  with CLL treated with alemtuzumab [37]. Th e mechanism of  increased risk of CMV activation in patients with CLL treated  with these growth factors is unknown. Compared to patients  on the previous trial (MC038G), patients treated with GM- CSF had a lower rate of grade 3 – 4 neutropenia (9% vs. 17%),  but there was no decrease in grade 3 – 4 infections (12% vs.  6%). Th e addition of GM-CSF to alemtuzumab and rituximab  therapy does not appear to be useful in decreasing the risk of  infection in this patient population. Sensitive assays for residual CLL could be useful in  determining the extent of response to treatment. In this  study, most patients had a negative sensitive fl ow cytometry  assay for MRD in the blood during treatment, but this did  not predict the quality or duration of response to treatment. Our data thus support the previously published fi nding that  MRD testing in the peripheral blood during and for the fi rst  3 months after alemtuzumab therapy is not a reliable method  of determining response to treatment [38]. In contrast,  patients with CR/CRi and negative IHC examinations  for residual CLL cells in the BM had the most durable  responses to treatment. Th ese data support previous reports  that MRD testing in the bone marrow during and within 3  months of completion of therapy is predictive of response  to treatment for regimens using alemtuzumab [38]. How- ever, the small number of patients in our study precludes  any defi nitive conclusions about the clinical utility of these  assays. Th e results of this trial show that the addition of GM-CSF  to the combination of alemtuzumab and rituximab does not  increase the effi cacy of alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy.

Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most com- mon leukemia in Western countries (1). It is estimated that there will be 15,720 new cases of CLL and 4,600 deaths because of CLL in 2014 in the United States (2). CLL is predominant in older individuals with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years. CLL has a variable natural historywitha5-yearrelativesurvivalrateofapproximate- ly 82% (3). CLL is characterized by increasing levels of clonal lym- phocytesintheblood,bonemarrow,andlymphatictissues (4). The diagnosis of CLL requires at least 5 109 B lymphocytes/L (5,000/mL) in the peripheral blood and confirmation of clonality by flow cytometry. CLL cells coexpresstheT-cellantigenCD5andB-cellsurfaceantigens CD19, CD20, and CD23 (5). Approved therapies for CLL include chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, alemtuzumab, benda- mustine, ofatumumab, and rituximab. For previously untreated patients with progressive CLL, recommended treatment regimens primarily consist of chemoimmu- notherapies.However,inpatientswithcoexistingmedical conditions, often including the elderly, aggressive treat- ment regimens are poorly tolerated (6). Allogeneic stem- cell transplantation is the only potentially curative treat- ment for CLL (7).

Toxicology studies were conducted using cynomolgus monkeys. Obinutuzumab binds human and cynomolgus monkeyCD20withsimilaraffinity.Repeat-dosetoxicology studies of up to 26 weeks’ duration using i.v. administra- tion of obinutuzumab or 4 weeks’ duration using s.c. administration were conducted. Toxicities observed from repeat-dose studies were consistent with the intended pharmacology of obinutuzumab or were the apparent resultofcross-speciesimmunogenicityeffects.Theprimary effects of obinutuzumab included hypersensitivity reac- tions and marked decreases in circulating B cells, with corresponding lymphoid tissue B-cell depletion in the spleenandlymphnodes.Transientnaturalkillercellreduc- tions were also observed, as were opportunistic infections secondary to immunosuppression. Administration of obinutuzumab to pregnant monkeys duringgestationwasassociatedwithcompletedepletionof B lymphocytes in infants. Obinutuzumab did not affect embryo–fetaldevelopment,parturition,postnatalsurvival, orthegrowthanddevelopmentofinfants.Obinutuzumab crosses the blood–placental barrier and is secreted in the milk of pregnant monkeys. Because of the depletion of B cells and possible opportunistic infections, use of obinu- tuzumab during pregnancy is not recommended. Clinical Pharmacology The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for obi- nutuzumab were derived using a population-based phar- macokinetic (pop-PK) analysis.

Consideration was given to holding antihypertensive agents before and throughout the infusion because infusion reactions sometimes includ- edhypotension.Infusionreactionsweremanagedbyinter- rupting or reducing the infusion rate and administering concomitant medications such as steroids and antihista- mines. Upon resolution of symptoms, the infusion was resumed at one-half the previous rate. Obinutuzumab was tobeadministeredatalocationwithimmediatelyavailable emergency resuscitation equipment. Patientswithahightumorburden(WBC 25 109/Lor bulky lymphadenopathy) were to receive adequate hydra- tion and antihyperuricemics before the initiation of treat- ment for prophylaxis of tumor lysis syndrome. Disease assessment was performed at baseline, after 3 cycles, 28 days after the last trial treatment, 3 months after theendoftreatment,andthenevery3monthsuntil3years fromlasttreatment.Furtherfollow-upvisitswerescheduled every6monthsuntil5years,andthenannuallyfor8years after the last patient entered the trial. A CT scan was per- formed in patients who had achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response 2 to 3 months after end of treat- ment. In patients who had a CR (or cytopenic CR), a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were obtained. A CT scan was alsoperformedwhenprogressionofdiseasewasdetectedby physical examination. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free sur- vival(PFS)basedoninvestigator’sassessment.However,the regulatory decision was based on independent review com- mittee(IRC)–assessedPFS.TheIRCwascomposedofapanel of CLL experts (each patient reviewed by two reviewers and one adjudicator if required) who assessed response and progressionbasedonperipheralbloodcounts,bonemarrow biopsy results, reports of physical examination, and radiol- ogy reports. Secondary efficacy endpoints included best overall response, event-free survival, duration of response, disease-freesurvival,timetonew antileukemictherapy,and overall survival. Response was determined using the NCI/ International Workshop on CLL guideline (5). End of trial was defined as 8 years after the last patient was enrolled. Results Demographics Patientdemographicsanddiseasecharacteristics,includ- ing CLL prognostic factors were balanced at baseline between treatment arms (Table 1). ',\n"," 'The median age was 73 years, 76% of patients had multiple coexisting medical conditions and 68% had a CrCl <70 mL/min. Efficacy The IRC-assessed median PFS was 23.0 months in the GClb arm versus 11.1 months in the Clb arm [Fig. 1 (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11–0.24; P < 0.0001 stratified log-rank test)]. The investigator-assessed median PFS durations were 23.0 months in the GClb arm and 10.9 months in the Clb arm (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09–0.21; P < 0.0001 stratified log-rank test). The results of the secondary end- points were supportive of the primary endpoint; however, there was no multiplicity adjustment plan for testing the secondaryendpoints.Table2liststheresultsoftheprimary andkeysecondaryendpoints.Theoverallsurvival(OS)data were not mature at the analysis cutoff date. The median observationtimewas14.2months,andthemediannumber of treatment cycles was 6. Eighty-one percent and 67% of patientsintheGClbandClbarms,respectively,receivedall 6 treatment cycles. Safety Thesafetydatasetincluded240patientswhoreceivedone ormoredosesofobinutuzumabwithClband116patients who received Clb only. Although Clb dose modifications or delays occurred twice as often in the GClb arm (32% vs. 15%), the median cumulative dose was comparable in the twoarms (370mg vs.384 mg). The mostfrequently reported adverse reactions with an incidence of 5% or greater and occurring at least 2% more frequently in the GClb arm were infusion-related reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pyrexia, cough, leukopenia, and musculoskeletal pains (Table 3). The most common serious adverse reaction was infusion-related reaction (11%). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was more common in the GClb arm (34%) than in the Clb arm (16%). The incidence of infections was not higher in the GClb arm, but 32% of patients in the GClb arm received G-CSF compared with 14% in the Clb arm. Growth factors were allowed for neutropenia per investigator or institutional guidelines. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 4% of patients in the GClb arm. Theincidenceofinfusionreactionswas69%withthefirst infusion of obinutuzumab, and the incidence of reactions with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1,000 mg and <1% thereafter. Symptoms of infusion-related reactionsoccurringingreaterthan20%ofpatientsincluded hypotension, nausea, chills, and pyrexia. Changes to the administration of obinutuzumab during the trial (includ- ingglucocorticoid,analgesic,andantihistaminetreatment, omission of antihypertensive medications in the morning ofthefirstinfusion,andadministrationofthecycle1day1 dose over 2 days) seemed to reduce the incidence of infu- sion reactions. Late-occurring neutropenia ( 28 days after treatment) was seen in 16% of patients on the GClb arm and 12% of patients on the Clb arm.

However, a recent update of study CLL11, including an analysis of stage 2, reported significant improvements inOSforthe GClbarm compared with the Clb arm and in PFS for the GClb arm comparedwiththeRClbarm(10).Thesedatahavenotbeen reviewed by the FDA. The main adverse reactions that occurred in the GClb arm were infusion reactions and myelosuppression. Other important toxicities included in the labeling were the risks of hepatitis B virus reactivation and JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoence- phalopathy, which were observed in patients treated with obinutuzumab in other clinical trials. The FDA review of the randomized trial comparison of GClb to Clb concluded that there was a favorable benefit–risk outcome for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL.

The results of trial CLL11 indicate that the combination of obinutuzumab þ chlor- ambucil is more effective than chlorambucil alone, has an acceptable safetyprofile, andisanappropriate regimen for elderly patients with previously untreated CLL and comor- bidities. Because aggressive treatments for older patients with comorbidities are poorly tolerated, chlorambucil was considered an acceptable active control for this trial. How- ever, in future trials in this patient population the GClb regimen would be an appropriate control.

Abstract: 250  Body text: 4495  Figures/tables: 6  References: 30  Supplementary figures/tables: 7  Page 4 of 30  Translational relevance  Pinatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22 on B cells and containing  the potent antimicrotubule agent MMAE. In this Phase I study, clinical activity of pinatuzumab  vedotin was observed in heavily pretreated patients with advanced non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (NHL). In addition, evaluating the combination of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab administered at standard doses and schedules was feasible. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of antibody-drug conjugates to deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy to tumors and  further validates CD22 as a target suitable for an antibody-drug conjugate. The safety,  tolerability, and clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab has important implications  for the ability of antibody-drug conjugates to be combined with standard anti-cancer treatment  regimens in B-cell malignancies, and support further clinical investigation of these novel  therapeutic combinations. Page 5 of 30  Abstract  Purpose: Pinatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate with the potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to an anti-CD22 antibody via a protease- cleavable linker. ',\n"," 'This Phase I study determined its recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and  evaluated its safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity alone and with rituximab relapsed/refractory (r/r) non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Experimental Design: Patients received escalating doses of pinatuzumab vedotin every days. Clinical activity at the RP2D alone or with rituximab was evaluated in r/r diffuse large B- cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and r/r indolent NHL (iNHL) patients. Results: Seventy-five patients received single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin. The RP2D was 2.4  mg/kg, based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of Grade 4 neutropenia >7 days in 1/3 patients  and Grade 4 neutropenia <7 days in 2/3 patients treated at 3.2 mg/kg (maximum assessed dose). No DLTs occurred at 2.4 mg/kg. At the RP2D, neutropenia was the most common Grade  ≥3 adverse event. Peripheral neuropathy-related Grade ≥2 adverse events most frequently resulted in treatment discontinuation. Rituximab co-treatment did not impact safety, tolerability,  or pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin. Unconjugated MMAE exposure was much lower  than antibody-conjugated MMAE exposure without accumulation with repeat dosing. At the  RP2D, objective responses were observed in DLBCL (9/25) and iNHL (7/14) patients; 2/8  patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (RP2D) and rituximab had complete responses. CLL  patients showed no objective responses. Conclusions: The RP2D of pinatuzumab vedotin alone and with rituximab was 2.4 mg/kg, which  was well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity in r/r NHL. Page 6 of 30  Introduction  Despite improvements in outcomes of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), many patients experience disease recurrence progression. Such patients have incurable disease requiring repeated courses of treatment, with  survival ranging from less than 1 year for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1) to several  years for indolent NHL (iNHL) (2, 3). Treatments that significantly extend disease-free intervals  and overall survival with minimal treatment-associated toxicity continue to be an unmet need. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) directed against tumor-associated surface antigens provide targeted delivery of chemotherapy, with the goal of improving potency while reducing  systemic cytotoxic effects. CD22 is an accessory molecule that plays a role in B-cell antigen receptor signaling and is  expressed on mature B cells, more than 95% of B-cell NHL, as well as in CLL (4; Genentech,  data on file). The lineage specificity of CD22 makes it an attractive target for antibody-based  therapeutics. ',\n"," 'Epratuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD22, relies on antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for anti-tumor activity, similar to rituximab. It has been  tested clinically, has an acceptable safety profile and single-agent activity in patients with  DLBCL and iNHL (5, 6), and is combinable with standard anti-lymphoma treatment regimens (7). ADCs targeting CD22 internalize upon binding to the target, which is considered essential for ADC activity, and have demonstrated pre-clinical anti-tumor activity (8). Pinatuzumab vedotin  is an ADC consisting of the microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE),  conjugated to an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody via the protease-cleavable peptide linker  maleimidocaproylvaline-citrulline(vc)-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (9–11). MMAE has a mode of  action similar to vincristine, which is commonly used to treat NHL and is the cytotoxic component of the anti-CD30–targeting ADC, brentuximab vedotin, which is approved for the  treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (12). While the  Page 7 of 30  unconjugated antibody of pinatuzumab vedotin demonstrated modest activity against tumor  xenografts in mouse models of NHL suggestive of some level of ADCC and/or complement- dependent cytotoxicity, tumor regression was significantly more pronounced with treatment with  the ADC form (13). Together, these data supported the clinical feasibility of a CD22-directed  ADC for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The goals of this multicenter, open-label phase I study were to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and  preliminary anti-tumor activity of pinatuzumab vedotin in patients with NHL and CLL. Materials and Methods  Study Design and Patients  This Phase I multicenter, open-label study employed a 3+3 dose-escalation design determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Eight centers enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse DLBCL, iNHL (including follicular lymphoma, marginal zone  lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL, and for  whom no suitable therapy of curative intent or higher priority existed. Demonstration of tumor  CD22 expression was not required. ',\n"," 'Eligibility criteria included: age ≥18 years; Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2; measurable disease; adequate end-organ function as assessed by standard laboratory chemistries and hematology tests; no  prior antibody or ADC within 4 weeks; no radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or investigational treatment within two weeks prior to the first dose of pinatuzumab vedotin; no prior allogeneic  stem cell transplant; no autologous stem cell transplant within 100 days of first study treatment  administration; no history of central nervous system lymphoma; Grade ≤1 peripheral neuropathy. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards prior to patient recruitment and  was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Page 8 of 30  Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients signed an informed consent prior enrollment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01209130. Procedures  Pinatuzumab vedotin (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was administered  intravenously over 30–90 minutes in 21-day cycles, with the starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg based  on pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic data of pinatuzumab vedotin in cynomolgus monkeys (Genentech, Inc.; data on file). Patients were monitored during the first cycle for dose- limiting toxicities (DLT) defined as: Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding nausea or  vomiting in the absence of premedication or that could be medically managed; febrile neutropenia; Grade ≥3 neutropenia without recovery by at least one grade/week in the absence  of growth factor support (growth factor support was permitted beyond the first cycle); Grade ≥3  thrombocytopenia without recovery by at least one grade/week in the absence of bleeding, associated with bleeding, or requirement for platelet transfusion. The highest dose where <33%  of a minimum of six patients experienced a DLT was designated as the MTD. The RP2D was  determined on the totality of the data observed in the dose-escalation cohorts, including  pharmacokinetics, DLTs, safety, and tolerability. Decisions regarding dose escalation were not  made until all patients enrolled in the dose-escalation cohort, regardless of number, were  evaluated through the DLT observation period. In the absence of toxicities, intra-patient dose  escalation to the highest cleared dose level was permitted. Indication-specific expansion cohorts (r/r DLBCL and r/r iNHL) were enrolled to further assess the safety and tolerability and to preliminarily assess efficacy of pinatuzumab vedotin at  the RP2D. ',\n"," 'An additional cohort was enrolled to receive pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D  combined with rituximab (375 mg/m ) every 21 days. Study treatment (single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin or pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab) was continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician  decision. Following documented disease progression, patients were followed until resolution or  Page 9 of 30  stabilization of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Patients who discontinued study  treatment for reasons other than progression of disease were followed for response and survival  for up to one year. For patients with treatment-emergent Grade 3–4 non-neuropathic AEs and  Grade 2–3 peripheral sensory neuropathy AEs, treatment delays of up to two weeks were  permitted. Patients were permitted to resume treatment at the end of two weeks upon resolution  of the AE(s). In these cases, patient doses were reduced to a previously established dose level. Rituximab dose modifications were not permitted. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE 2014). Adverse events were coded preferred terms as defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Laboratory monitoring (hematology and serum chemistries) was conducted at least weekly for  the first four cycles, then on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle thereafter. Investigator-based assessments of anti-tumor activity using computed tomography (CT), CT-positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in accordance with standard  response criteria for NHL (14) or CLL (15), were conducted every three months, independently of treatment schedule. The pharmacokinetic profile of pinatuzumab vedotin was characterized by analysis of serum  total antibody (TAb; including conjugated and deconjugated antibody) and rituximab, measured by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Genentech, Inc.; data  on file); and plasma conjugate (antibody-conjugated MMAE [acMMAE]) and unconjugated MMAE as measured by validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (Genentech, Inc.; data on file). Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using non- compartmental analysis (WinNonlin, Version 5.2.1; Pharsight, Princeton, NJ). Anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) were measured in serum by validated ELISA (Genentech, Inc.; data on file)  and further characterized by competitive binding with unconjugated anti-CD22 antibody Page 10 of 30  determine if responses were primarily directed against the antibody or the linker-drug portion of  the ADC. ',\n"," 'Outcomes  The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pinatuzumab vedotin  administered every 21 days in patients with r/r NHL and CLL, determine the MTD and DLTs of  pinatuzumab vedotin, identify an RP2D for pinatuzumab vedotin, and assess the safety and  tolerability of pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab in patients with r/r NHL. Secondary  objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin, determine the  incidence of ATAs, and preliminarily evaluate anti-tumor activity per standard response criteria  (14, 15). Statistical Analysis  Sample-size determinations were not based on explicit power and type I error assumptions, but rather to obtain sufficient safety, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetic data to inform  subsequent clinical testing of pinatuzumab vedotin. Planned enrollment of 30–50 patients during  dose escalation was based upon the assumption that 5–8 cohorts containing 3–6 patients each  would be enrolled, with allowances for patient replacement. An objective response rate (ORR)  ≥30% with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin would be viewed as encouraging. For an ORR  ≥30%, the probability of observing ≥2 responses among 10 patients is ≥85% and the probability  of observing ≥4 responses among 20 patients is ≥89%. Together, the total planned sample size  for escalation and expansion was 80–100 patients. Patients who received any amount of pinatuzumab vedotin were evaluable for safety analyses. Patients with baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline tumor  assessment following pinatuzumab vedotin treatment were evaluable for efficacy analyses. Progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) were analyzed by the Kaplan- Meier method and were defined as the time from the first day of study treatment and response,  respectively, to disease progression or death. In the absence of progressive disease, death, or  Page 11 of 30  loss to follow-up, PFS and DOR were censored for survival analysis at the day of the last tumor  assessment. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results  Patient Enrollment, Treatment, and DLT Determination  Between October 26, 2010 and December 12, 2012, 91 patients were enrolled into the study  (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Table 1). Seventy-five patients were treated with  single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin and 16 patients were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. Patient baseline and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1. ',\n"," 'Thirty-two NHL patients were treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at dose levels  of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.2 mg/kg. One DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia with delayed  recovery was observed among 3 evaluable patients treated at the 3.2-mg/kg dose level. The  other two patients treated at the 3.2-mg/kg dose level experienced Grade 4 neutropenia with  recovery occurring in fewer than seven days. Based on these observations, while 3.2 mg/kg did  not exceed the protocol-defined MTD, no further dose escalation was tested. None of the six  patients treated in the 2.4 mg/kg dose escalation cohort experienced a DLT. Consequently, 2.4  mg/kg every 21 days was designated the RP2D in r/r NHL. Thirty-nine NHL patients were  treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, including 25 with DLBCL and 14  with iNHL (including one patient with transformed follicular lymphoma), with a median of 5  cycles (range 1–19) for DLBCL patients and a median of 5 cycles (range 1–27) for iNHL  patients. A total of 16 patients received pinatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab; five  patients received pinatuzumab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg and 11 received pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4  mg/kg. No DLTs were observed in any patient; two patients who were enrolled to receive pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg were not evaluable for DLT because of clinical disease  Page 12 of 30  progression during the DLT observation period. Patients receiving the combination received a  median of 5.5 cycles (range 1–24). Ten patients with CLL were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin at 1.0, 1.8, and 2.4 mg/kg. DLTs were observed. Because enrollment of CLL patients was terminated by the sponsor, the  MTD was not formally determined. Safety  Treatment-emergent AEs with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin by assigned dose level and  histology and Grade 3–5 treatment-emergent AEs with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin across all dose levels and histologies (NHL and CLL), regardless of attribution to the study drug  by the treating physician, are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Most AEs reported in the 39 NHL patients treated at the RP2D (2.4 mg/kg) were Grade 1–2  in severity (Figure 1). Twenty-seven (69%) patients reported Grade 3–4 adverse events; the  most common in ≥2 patients included neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral sensory neuropathy, hyperglycemia, and anemia. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia was reported in one patient. ',\n"," 'Serious  AEs were reported in 13 (33%) NHL patients. Pyrexia was reported in three patients and  dyspnea in two patients; otherwise, no single serious AE was reported in ≥2 patients. Thirteen  (33%) patients discontinued pinatuzumab vedotin treatment due to an AE. Peripheral neuropathy-related AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 11 patients (peripheral sensory  neuropathy in 7 patients, peripheral motor neuropathy in 2 patients, peripheral sensorimotor  neuropathy and undefined in one patient each); no other AE led to treatment discontinuation >1 patient. Sixteen (41%) patients had at least one dose delay due to an adverse event. Nine  patients had a dose reduction to 1.8 mg/kg: 6 for peripheral neuropathy and 1 each for  neutropenia, pancreatitis, and fatigue. Among the ten patients with CLL who were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin across all  assessed dose levels, three patients had a Grade 3 event, one patient had a Grade 4 event and  one patient had a Grade 5 event of progressive disease. No single Grade 3–5 event was  Page 13 of 30  reported in more than one patient. With the exception of the patient who discontinued due to  Grade 5 progressive disease, no dose reductions or treatment discontinuations for adverse  events were reported. Among the 16 patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (both 1.8 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg dose levels) combined with rituximab, the most common treatment-emergent AEs in ≥4 patients  were fatigue (n = 8), neutropenia (n = 6), diarrhea (n = 5), peripheral sensory neuropathy (n =  5), nausea (n = 4), and constipation (n = 4) (Supplementary Table 2). Ten patients experienced  a Grade 3–4 AE: neutropenia (n = 4), peripheral sensory neuropathy (n = 2) and hyperglycemia (n = 2). Four patients discontinued study treatment for an AE: peripheral sensory neuropathy (n  = 2); increased blood creatinine phosphokinase and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n = 1 each). Five patients had at least one dose delay for AEs and three had a dose reduction for AEs (n = 2  peripheral neuropathy and n = 1 neutropenia). A total of six deaths (DLBCL [n = 4], MCL [n = 1] and CLL [n = 1]) were reported 23–55 days  after the last dose of pinatuzumab vedotin. ',\n"," 'Four deaths were reported following single-agent  pinatuzumab vedotin (progressive disease, n = 3; failure to thrive, n = 1) and two following  pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab due to disease progression. None of the deaths  were attributed to pinatuzumab vedotin by the treating investigator. AEs associated with peripheral neuropathy, as defined by the MedDRA Standardized Query, were reported in 23 of 39 (59%) NHL patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, and in 7 of 16 patients (44%) treated in combination with rituximab, and  were Grade ≤2 in 19 of 23 (83%) and 12 of 16 (75%), respectively. The median time to onset of  the first peripheral neuropathy event was 2.8 months following a median of 2 cycles. The  median time to develop a Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 6.2 months of treatment or a  median of 7 cycles. Fifteen patients discontinued study treatment due to a peripheral neuropathy-related AE. No differences in time-to-onset were observed based on disease histology. The majority of study treatment discontinuations occurred with Grade 2 events at a  Page 14 of 30  median of 7.4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1–10.3 months). Among 33 peripheral neuropathy events that resulted in treatment delays, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuations, complete resolution of the peripheral neuropathy event was reported in 10  (30%). Prior history of peripheral neuropathy and/or prior treatment with vinca alkaloids, which  were reported in 29/91 (32%) and 72/91 (79%) of all treated patients, respectively, were not  associated with a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy resulting from pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment. The incidence of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during pinatuzumab vedotin treatment was generally similar to that among patients who lacked either or both of  these baseline factors (Supplementary Table 3). Pharmacokinetics  Pharmacokinetic parameters for acMMAE, TAb, and unconjugated MMAE in NHL patients are summarized in Table 2. Concentration-time pharmacokinetic profiles are illustrated Supplementary Figure 2. Maximal concentrations (Cmax) for acMMAE and TAb were observed the end of infusion. At the RP2D, mean half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL) values for acMMAE  and TAb were similar, with volumes of distribution for both largely approaching plasma volume. These parameters were not affected by rituximab co-administration. Unconjugated MMAE Cmax  was observed 2–4 days after pinatuzumab vedotin administration (Supplementary Figure 2). ',\n"," 'Unconjugated MMAE Cmax and exposure (AUCinf, area under the concentration-time curve from  time 0 extrapolated to infinity) were much lower than those of acMMAE. At 2.4 mg/kg, there was  approximately a 124–165-fold difference for Cmax and approximately a 42–70-fold difference for  AUCinf between acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE respectively. No unconjugated MMAE  accumulation was observed with repeat dosing. The pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL patients was notable for faster acMMAE and TAb clearance compared to that observed in NHL patients at each corresponding dose level (Supplementary Table 4). Page 15 of 30  For patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin, 1 of 72 ATA-evaluable patients  (1.4%) tested positive for ATAs. For patients treated in combination with rituximab, none of 15  evaluable patients tested positive for ATAs. Together, the overall treatment-emergent ATA  incidence was 1.1% (1 of 87). Characterization by competitive binding indicated that the  antibody response was directed primarily to the antibody portion of pinatuzumab vedotin  (Genentech, data on file). Anti-tumor activity  The median duration of follow-up of all efficacy-evaluable patients across all dose levels was  3.8 months (range 0.07–27.6+ months, IQR 1.4–7.6 months). Objective responses are summarized in Table 3. Tumor reductions were mostly observed at pinatuzumab vedotin doses  ≥1.8 mg/kg (Figure 2). Objective responses at the single-agent RP2D included 5 of 20 (25%)  patients with refractory DLBCL (2 complete responses, 3 partial responses [PR]); 1 PR was  observed among the 6 DLBCL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. Objective responses were observed in 5 of 12 (42%) patients with refractory iNHL  treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin (3 complete responses, 2 PRs) and 1 PR of 3  patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab. In DLBCL patients treated with single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D, the median  PFS was 4.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–5.5 months, IQR 2.1–17 months) (Figure  3A); the median DOR was 3.0 months (95% CI 1 month–not reached, IQR 2.8–13.1 months). iNHL patients (Figure 3B), the median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI 1.3–15.2 months, IQR 6.7– 15.2 months); the median DOR was 4.2 months (95% CI 1.2–20.7 months, IQR 2.8–6.9 months). ',\n"," 'The median PFS for patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab was 5.8  months (95% CI 1.2 months–not reached, IQR 1.3 months–not reached); the median DOR was  not reached (IQR 4.9 months–not reached). In MCL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin  at doses ≥1.8 mg/kg alone or combined with rituximab, the PFS ranged from 0.4–9.2 months. Page 16 of 30  No clear correlations between PFS outcomes and baseline characteristics were identified (Supplementary Table 5). None of the 10 CLL patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin achieved an objective response (Table 3). Discussion  Results from this study established pinatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg every 21 days as the  RP2D in r/r NHL. Neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were the principal treatment-emergent toxicities. Neutropenia was expected based on pre-clinical toxicology observations (Genentech,  Inc.; data on file) and clinical experience with brentuximab vedotin and polatuzumab vedotin,  both of which contain the same linker-MMAE construct as pinatuzumab vedotin (12, 16). Neutropenia mostly manifested as laboratory abnormalities and, in most cases, did not lead to  study treatment discontinuation. Clinical sequelae of neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia  and severe infections, were uncommon. Administration of growth factors in accordance with  published guidelines (17) and increasing the cycle duration to 28 days facilitated neutrophil  count recovery and enabled continued treatment. Peripheral neuropathy is consistent with the mechanism of action of MMAE and is  considered to be an effect of this class of drugs. The frequency and severity of peripheral  neuropathy events observed with pinatuzumab vedotin were generally similar to that observed  in r/r HL patients treated with brentuximab vedotin (18), despite differences in dose (2.4 mg/kg  vs. 1.8 mg/kg), and were similar to that observed with polatuzumab vedotin in r/r NHL (16). Most  events were sensory; however, peripheral motor neuropathy and combined peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy were also observed. Patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy  underwent dose delays until resolution before resuming treatment at a reduced dose, but the full  impact of these measures on peripheral neuropathy reversibility requires further study. While  the majority of patients who were enrolled into the study received prior treatment with neurotoxic  Page 17 of 30  therapies, neither this nor a prior history of peripheral neuropathy was associated with a  substantially increased risk of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy. ',\n"," 'Identifying additional  factors (e.g., age, pre-existing neuropathic conditions, or other co-morbidities that result in a  higher predisposition to peripheral neuropathy with vc-MMAE–based ADCs) and assessing the  relationship between peripheral neuropathy and pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics requires additional study. The pharmacokinetic properties of pinatuzumab vedotin are largely consistent with reports  of other MMAE ADCs (12, 16). The levels of unconjugated MMAE were consistently much lower  than those of the conjugate (acMMAE). The overall pharmacokinetic profile of pinatuzumab vedotin appeared largely driven by the antibody component, given the similarities between total  antibody and conjugate (acMMAE) pharmacokinetics. Response rates, PFS, and DOR with pinatuzumab vedotin treatment in NHL were  encouraging given the heavily pretreated patient population with advanced disease. Anti-tumor  responses were observed at doses ≥1.8 mg/kg, suggesting that patients who require dose  reductions from the RP2D for treatment-emergent toxicity may also receive continued clinical  benefit with longer treatment durations. Interestingly, in five patients, pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment resulted in responses sufficient to enable subsequent allogeneic stem cell  transplantation (data not shown). Additional studies will be required to assess the potential of  pinatuzumab vedotin as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation in previously transplant-ineligible patients. Unlike NHL, there was no early evidence of clinical benefit of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL  patients. Recognizing that treatment-emergent toxicities may differ between NHL and CLL due  to underlying differences in clinical characteristics and natural history, separate pinatuzumab  vedotin dose escalations were conducted for each. Given the decision to terminate enrollment  of CLL patients into the study, the MTD of pinatuzumab vedotin was not determined, and direct  comparison of treatment-emergent safety data between NHL and CLL patients is therefore not  Page 18 of 30  possible. In CLL patients who were treated with pinatuzumab vedotin, no objective responses  were observed. Pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics indicated lower exposure and faster  clearance for TAb and acMMAE in CLL compared to NHL patients, presumably due to the  greater number of circulating B cells in CLL patients, resulting in significant target-mediated  clearance of pinatuzumab vedotin. This profile is similar to what was observed with polatuzumab vedotin treatment in CLL patients (16). Whether this and other factors may have  ultimately affected the anti-tumor activity of pinatuzumab vedotin in CLL requires further study. ',\n"," 'Overall, the clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin treatment supports the therapeutic potential of ADCs targeting CD22 in patients with B-cell NHL. The risk-benefit profile pinatuzumab vedotin appears distinct from its individual components. For example, the  response rates of 2.4 mg/kg pinatuzumab vedotin in r/r DLBCL (9 of 25 [36%]) and r/r iNHL (7 of  14 [50%]) compare favorably to those of the monoclonal anti-CD22 antibody epratuzumab, which has single-agent objective response rates of 15% in DLBCL (6) and 18% in iNHL (5). addition, the tolerability profile of epratuzumab is similar to that of other unconjugated monoclonal antibodies, without the toxicities (neutropenia or peripheral neuropathy) observed  with pinatuzumab vedotin treatment. Pinatuzumab vedotin also compares favorably vincristine and liposomal vincristine, the latter of which had an objective response rate of 25% in  aggressive NHL and was associated with considerably worse neurotoxicity (29% Grade 3, 3%  Grade 4 vs. 17% Grade 3, no Grade 4 events for pinatuzumab vedotin observed in this study)  (19). Finally, the clinical activity of pinatuzumab vedotin compares favorably with other ADCs  targeting B-cell antigens (20); the response rate of pinatuzumab vedotin in r/r DLBCL is  comparable with those observed with the CD22-targeted calicheamicin ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin (15%), the CD79b-targeted polatuzumab vedotin (52%), the CD19-targeted maytansinoid ADC SAR3419 (33%), and brentuximab vedotin in CD30+ DLBCL (44%) (16, 21– 23). While anti-tumor activity is generally similar, it is important to note that each ADC has a  distinct toxicity profile based largely on the mechanism of action of the cytotoxic agent:  Page 19 of 30  neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy for pinatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and  brentuximab vedotin, thrombocytopenia for inotuzumab ozogamicin, and ocular toxicities for  SAR3419. Consequently, maximizing the risk-benefit profile of ADCs (e.g., through alternate  doses and schedules to minimize the frequency and severity of peripheral neuropathy) is an  important issue that requires further investigation. To realize the full therapeutic potential of ADCs, it is crucial to demonstrate the ability of  ADCs to combine with or replace agents that constitute current standards of care. In this regard,  demonstrating the combinability of pinatuzumab vedotin with rituximab is important given the  effectiveness of rituximab-containing regimens in NHL (24, 25). ',\n"," 'Clinical data with other  rituximab-ADC combinations have demonstrated additive clinical activity over either agent  alone; the addition of rituximab to inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in higher objective response  and complete response rates over inotuzumab ozogamicin alone (21, 26). Furthermore, the  ability of combining CD22- and CD20-directed antibodies was demonstrated in a Phase II study  of epratuzumab and rituximab in previously untreated follicular lymphoma, with evidence clinical activity comparable to standard chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy based regimens  (27). Preliminary results in this study suggest that the toxicity profiles between combined  pinatuzumab vedotin and rituximab and single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin are similar. Pinatuzumab vedotin pharmacokinetics was unaffected by rituximab co-administration and vice  versa (data not shown). While durable responses with the combination were observed, the  individual contributions of each agent to overall anti-tumor activity could not be determined due  to the small number of patients treated. Further assessment of the pinatuzumab  vedotin/rituximab combination is ongoing in a Phase II randomized study (ROMULUS, NCT01691898) comparing the clinical activity of two MMAE ADCs, pinatuzumab vedotin and  polatuzumab vedotin, each in combination with rituximab. Preliminary results indicate unexpected safety findings and greater clinical activity compared to either ADC alone (28). patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, for example, objective and complete response (CR)  Page 20 of 30  rates of pinatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab were greater than those of the single- agent pinatuzumab vedotin (ORR, 57% vs. 36%; CR, 24% vs. 16%, for combination vs. single- agent, respectively). Beyond combinations with rituximab early data from ongoing clinical  studies indicate the ability of ADCs, including polatuzumab vedotin and brentuximab vedotin, to  combine with systemic chemotherapy used in current anti-lymphoma immunochemotherapy regimens (29, 30). In summary, results of this Phase I study of pinatuzumab vedotin demonstrate clinical activity of CD22-directed ADCs that warrants further clinical investigation of this class of  molecules in B-cell malignancies. Given the emerging biologic heterogeneity and complexity of  B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, correlative analyses to identify predictive and prognostic  biomarkers will be important to identify patients most likely to benefit from pinatuzumab vedotin  treatment. ',\n"," 'Finally, results from this study further substantiate CD22 as a clinically validated ADC  target and opens up the possibility of developing ADCs targeting CD22 that contain different  classes of cytotoxic agents, ultimately leading to ADC combinations that target multiple B-cell  lineage antigens to deliver multiple cytotoxic agents more effectively than systemic multi-agent  chemotherapy.

Extended analysis of RESONATE-2 was conducted to determine long-term efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A total of 269 patients aged ≥65 years with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia with- out del(17p) were randomized 1:1 to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. Median ibru- tinib treatment duration was 28.5 months. Ibrutinib significantly pro- longed progression-free survival versus chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 15 months; hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001). The 24-month progression-free survival was 89% with ibrutinib (97% and 89% in patients with del[11q] and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, respec- tively). Progression-free survival rates at 24 months were also similar regardless of age (<75 years [88%], ≥75 years [89%]). Overall response rate was 92% (125/136). Rate of complete response increased substan- tially from 7% at 12 months to 18% with extended follow up. Greater quality of life improvements occurred with ibrutinib versuschlorambu- cil in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (P=0.0013). The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were neutrope- nia (12%), anemia (7%), and hypertension (5%). Rate of discontinua- tions due to adverse events was 12%. Results demonstrated that first- line ibrutinib for elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia provides sustained response and progression-free survival benefits over chemotherapy, with depth of response improving over time without new toxicity concerns.

With a median age at diagnosis of 71 years, management of this predominately older population is controversial given that frequent comorbidi- ties often preclude aggressive therapy. Randomized stud- ies have provided disparate results in older compared with younger patients. 2,3 Less intensive approaches, such as chlorambucil, provide limited response durability. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies has improved out- comes achieved with single-agent chlorambucil, adminis- tration of these intravenous agents has associated toxicity, and response durations remain limited. The first-in-class, oral, once-daily, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib targets signaling via the  B-cell receptor cascade, critical to survival of malignant lymphocytes. ',\n"," 'in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Early-phase studies demonstrat- ed responses of up to 84% in previously untreated patients, with complete response (CR) rates of up to 23% and up to 3 years of median follow up. 11,12 This small cohort suggested that single-agent ibrutinib might provide durable efficacy in first-line treatment of patients with CLL while avoiding toxicity inherent to cytotoxic or other infused regimens. RESONATE-2 was an international phase 3 study designed to definitively evaluate first-line ibrutinib treat- ment in older patients who often had baseline frailties against a standard chemotherapeutic agent, chlorambu- cil. Primary results demonstrated an 84% reduction in the risk of death at a median follow up of 18 months for ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil. Based on these findings, ibrutinib received approval in the United States, Europe, and other regions for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL, and allows for treatment without chemotherapy. 14,15  A detailed analysis of overall survival (OS) with longer follow up and adjustment for the impact of treatment crossover was previously reported. A sepa- rate data cut was subsequently performed after this detailed OS analysis to evaluate additional outcomes after long-term follow up. Herein, we present the extended analysis of additional outcomes from RESONATE-2 including quality-of-life (QOL) measures that may help guide appropriate use of ibrutinib for previously untreated patients. Methods Study design and population Eligible patients for RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115/1116; clinicaltri- als.gov identifier 01722487/01724346) had previously untreated CLL or SLL with active disease and were ≥65 years. Patients ≤70 years of age must have had a comorbidity that precluded treatment with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 cells/mm , platelet count ≥50,000/mm , and adequate liver and kidney function. Those with del(17p) CLL were excluded. This study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and approved by the institutional review boards of participating insti- tutions. All patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with oral ibrutinib, 420 mg once daily until disease progression or chlo- rambucil, 0.5 mg/kg (increased up to 0.8 mg/kg based on tolerabil- ity) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. ',\n"," 'Patients from the chlorambucil treatment arm with independent review com- mittee (IRC)-confirmed disease progression were eligible to cross over to second-line treatment with ibrutinib at the investigator’s discretion. End points and assessments End points included progression-free survival (PFS, defined as time from randomization to progression or death, whichever occurs earlier), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), improvement in hematologic variables, patient-reported health- related QOL, and safety. Disease progression and response was determined by investigator. QOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)- Fatigue questionnaires. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameters. Non-hematologic AEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03. Hematologic AEs were graded using International Workshop on CLL criteria. Statistical analyses PFS and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and a 2-sided log-rank test stratified by the randomization factors. Sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust for the impact of crossover on OS as previously described. ORR was analyzed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel c test, stratified by the ran- domization factors. QOL analyses were based on the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful changes in scores from base- line (≥3 points for FACIT-Fatigue). Additional QOL analyses used time-dependent mixed-models repeated measures analysis. Results Patients There were 269 patients randomly assigned to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) monotherapy in the RES- ONATE-2 study (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Patient characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms, as previously reported (Table 1). The median patient age was 73 years on the ibrutinib arm and 72 years on the chlorambucil arm. In the ibrutinib treatment arm, of those evaluated, 22% (29/130) had del(11q), and 48% (58/121) had unmutated IGHV. Patients initiated ibrutinib treat- ment for active disease per iwCLL criteria, most common- ly manifesting as marrow failure (progressive anemia or thrombocytopenia [40%]), progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy (40%) or splenomegaly (26%), with many patients having more than one indication for treat- ment including disease symptoms such as fatigue or night sweats (Table 1). Although 32% of patients had substan- tial fatigue when entering study, only 5% were started on CLL treatment solely for fatigue that was considered to have interfered with work or usual activities. With a medi- an follow up for this extended analysis of 29 months (maximum, 36 months), 107 patients (79%) remain on first-line ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Extended Phase 3 Results From RESONATE-2 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) 1503 Survival outcomes Ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer PFS compared with chlorambucil (median, PFS not reached vs. 15.0 months; Figure 1A). There was an 88% reduction in risk of PFS events (progression or death; hazard ratio [HR], 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001) for patients random- ized to ibrutinib. PFS at 24 months was 89% with ibruti- nib versus34% with chlorambucil. This rate was relatively stable with ibrutinib with an 18-month PFS of 94%. Ibrutinib consistently demonstrated significant improve- ments in PFS for patients in all subgroups including those considered high risk (Figure 2). In patients treated with ibrutinib, only 1 patient with del(11q) has had disease pro- gression, and the rates of 24-month PFS were 97% and 86% for those with or without del(11q), respectively (Figure 1B). No significant difference was observed in the PFS of patients with unmutated versusmutated IGHV (24- month PFS, 90% and 89%, respectively; Figure 1C). PFS benefits were consistent across additional subgroups of patients, including those with advanced disease (Rai stage 3 or 4) or bulky disease (Figure 2). PFS and OS rates were also similar regardless of age (24-month PFS, <75 years [88%], ≥75 years [89%]; OS, <75 years [94%], ≥75 years [96%]; Figure S2). With longer follow up and despite patient crossover, ibrutinib continues to demonstrate an OS benefit compared with chlorambucil (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.86; P=0.0145; Online Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S1), with a 24-month OS of 95% for ibrutinib vs. 84% for chlorambucil (Online Supplementary Figure S3). Responses for ibrutinib-treated patients With a maximum of 36 months of follow up, the ORR with ibrutinib treatment was 92% (Table 2). Eighteen per- cent of patients achieved CR, which improved from 7% at 12 months and 15% at 24 months (Figure 3). Comparable ORR and CR rates were also observed in high-risk sub- groups, including those with del(11q) (ORR, 100%; CR rate, 14%) or unmutated IGHV (ORR, 95%; CR rate, 21%). Disease burden and symptoms The vast majority of ibrutinib-treated patients experi- enced substantial reduction in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly at the time of the primary analysis which was much greater than observed with chlorambucil. ',\n"," '≥50% reduction in the lymph node sum of the product of longest diameter (SPD) occurred in 95% of patients treat- ed with ibrutinib versus40% of those treated with chlo- rambucil, with complete resolution in lymphadenopathy in 42% versus 7%, respectively (Online Supplementary Figure S4A,B). Reduction in splenomegaly by ≥50% occurred in 95% with ibrutinib versus52% with chloram- bucil, with complete resolution in splenomegaly in 56% versus 22%, respectively (Online Supplementary Figure S4C,D). Ibrutinib also resulted in higher rates of improve- ments in disease symptoms including weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, which were indications for therapy in many patients. Patient-reported QOL Greater improvements in QOL occurred with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in FACIT-Fatigue (P=0.0013) by repeated measure analyses (Online Supplementary Figure S5). Clinically meaningful improvements occurred more frequently with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in FACIT- Fatigue, although this was not statistically significant (86/136 [63%] vs.71/133 [53%]; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.92-2.45; P=0.1013). Safety and tolerability of ibrutinib Median treatment duration with ibrutinib was 28.5 months (range, 0.7-35.9 months). Most patients continue ibrutinib treatment, with 83% (112/135) receiving ibruti- nib continuously for durations exceeding 2 years. The most frequent AEs with ibrutinib with extended follow up were similar to the primary report : diarrhea, fatigue, P.M. Barr et al. 1504 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) Table 1.

Rates of grade ≥3 cytopenias decreased over time from 8.1%, 5.9%, and 2.2% during the first year of treatment to 0%, 1%, and 0% during the third year of treatment for neu- tropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Several AEs of clinical interest were characterized in greater detail (Table 3). Diarrhea generally occurred early in treatment (median, 26 days) and was completely reversible in 95% of patients within a median of 6 days. ',\n"," 'Visual disturbances (blurred vision or reduced visual acu- ity) were grade 1 or 2, with 57% of these completely resolving within a median of 37.5 days after onset. Hypertension occurred at a median of 187 days, with improvements reported at a median of 14 days after onset. Arthralgia was observed at a median of 135 days and was generally reversible (78% complete, 4% partial) within a median duration of approximately 3 weeks. Atrial fibrilla- tion was observed throughout treatment follow up, with 4% of patients experiencing a grade 3 event. Symptoms of atrial fibrillation quickly resolved in the majority of patients (57% complete, 7% partial resolution) within a median of 3 days. Nine patients (7%) experienced a major hemorrhage occurring at a median of 310 days. Of these, 3 patients were reported to have active treatment with concomitant medications that impact platelets or coagula- tion (aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, and naprox- en, respectively) including a traumatic hematoma, post- procedural hematoma, and hematuria, all of which were grade 3 in severity and did not result in study drug discon- tinuation. Grade ≥3 infection occurred in 23% of patients at a median of 138 days, including 2 that were fatal (Klebsiellainfection and septic shock). Grade ≥3 infections were observed most frequently in the first year of treat- ment and decreased thereafter (Figure 4).

',\n"," 'Treatment-limiting toxicity including both reductions and discontinuations due to AEs decreased over time with ibrutinib (Figure 4). Concomitant medications Concomitant medications were collected throughout the duration of ibrutinib treatment (median, 28.5 months) and chlorambucil (median, 7.1 months). Despite longer follow up recording of the use of these agents in the ibru- tinib arm versus the chlorambucil arm, the rate of neu- trophil growth factor use and platelet and red blood cell transfusion was higher in the chlorambucil arm. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered to 4% of ibrutinib-treated patients versus2% of those randomized to chlorambucil. Anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents were frequently used during study therapy (56% and 54% of patients treated with ibrutinib and chlorambucil, respectively; Online Supplementary Table S3), including anticoagulants in 21% of the ibrutinib-treated patients. Outcomes following ibrutinib discontinuation With up to 3 years follow up, out of 136 patients, only 4 patients discontinued ibrutinib primarily due to disease progression; 1 had unmutated IGHV and none were reported to have del(11q). Two of these 4 patients remain alive. Of the 16 patients who discontinued ibrutinib because of AEs; 13 (81%) are alive with a median of 13 P.M. Barr et al. 1506 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) Figure 2.

Sex months follow up after ibrutinib discontinuation and 3 have died (Online Supplementary Table S4). Ten of the patients had PR as best response, 4 patients discontinued after not responding to ibrutinib and 2 patients discontin- ued prior to response evaluation. Non-responders/non- evaluable had a PFS that ranged from 1.8 to 20.2 months, while responders tended to have a variable but longer PFS (4.2–34.0 months). ',\n"," 'As the vast majority of patients (79%) remain on single-agent ibrutinib, this analysis is limited in size and also to the patients who came off treatment fairly early (9 of the 16 patients who discontinued due to AEs did so in the first year). In total, 7 patients received subse- quent therapy after ibrutinib at a median of 7.6 months following ibrutinib discontinuation (range, 1.2 to  20.8 months), including fludarabine-cyclophosphamide- rituximab (n=3), bendamustine-rituximab (n=2), chloram- bucil (n=1), and radiation (n=1). Six of these 7 patients (86%) remain alive with median follow up of 21 months (range, 9 to 25 months). Discussion This extended analysis of RESONATE-2 with detailed clinical follow up demonstrates that ibrutinib continues to provide significant and sustained clinical benefits, improv- ing the quality of responses, for the first-line treatment of older patients with CLL or SLL with a manageable safety profile over extended durations of treatment. Consistent with the initial report, ibrutinib demonstrates a significant 88% reduction in the risk of PFS events (progression or death) compared with chlorambucil (P<0.0001) with extended follow up. In addition, the OS benefit for ibruti- nib compared with chlorambucil was maintained, despite crossover to treatment with ibrutinib for many patients in the chlorambucil arm (n=55). These data support the use of ibrutinib in the first-line treatment of CLL as a chemotherapy-free option that can be taken continuously, achieving long-term disease control for the majority of patients including those with high risk features. 10,13 Ibrutinib has a category 1 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN ) recommendation as a single- agent first-line treatment for CLL without del(17p) in patients ≥65 years and for relapsed/refractory CLL with- out del(17p). The efficacy of ibrutinib in the first-line setting appears superior to that observed in relapsed or refractory patients. Nearly all patients randomly assigned to ibruti- nib achieved rapid disease reduction, with an ORR of 92% translating to high rates of 24-month PFS and OS of 89% and 95%, respectively, with similar PFS and OS rates seen regardless of age. This observation suggests that ibru- tinib may be most effective when used upfront before the acquisition of poor-risk molecular aberrations, which are selected for with chemotherapy. 20,21 Additionally, sensitiv- ity analyses to adjust for the effects of patients in RES- ONATE-2 who crossed over to ibrutinib found that treat- ment with ibrutinib was still associated with statically sig- nificant OS compared with chlorambucil. ',\n"," 'These results also demonstrate that depth of response substantially increases over time, with higher rates of CR during the extended follow up, indicating a persistent action of the drug rather than a simple maintenance effect. Similar find- ings were observed with long-term follow up of patients enrolled in the phase 2 trial of first-line ibrutinib. Within this previous study, 29% of patients achieved a CR, and 92% remained alive and progression free at 5 years. Given these data, the CR rate will likely continue to increase in the present study as long-term disease control and high tolerability with first-line use can be expected based on the earlier phase 2 results. In addition to the efficacy benefits overall, sustained Extended Phase 3 Results From RESONATE-2 haematologica | 2018; 103(9) 1507 Figure 3. Response rates over time in ibrutinib-treated patients.

No difference in outcome was observed in patients with unmutated IGHVstatus, a traditional poor prognostic indicator for all chemoimmunotherapy regi- mens. Notably the rate of unmutated IGHVin this study of older patients was somewhat lower than other studies at 48% (vs. 58%-62% in CLL ), consistent with prior reports of higher frequency of unmutated IGHV in younger patients. 4,23 For patients with del(11q), another traditionally high-risk subgroup, 100% of the 29 patients responded to treatment with ibrutinib, and there was a 99% reduction in the risk of progression or death, with only 1 del(11q) ibrutinib-treated patient experiencing dis- ease progression after discontinuing therapy for an AE over the extended follow up. While this represents a rela- tively small patient subset (22%), ibrutinib demonstrates a particularly significant benefit in this population, which historically experiences inferior outcomes with traditional chemotherapy or CD20-based regimens. 24-26  Combined analysis of 3 randomized studies not only demonstrated superiority of ibrutinib over traditional chemotherapy and/or anti-CD20 comparators for patients with del(11q), but also equally positive PFS and OS outcomes irrespec- tive of del(11q). These results suggest that current defini- tions of high-risk disease and the impact of prognostic bio- markers may need to be redefined with ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'The mechanism why del(11q) patients may have better out- comes when treated with ibrutinib is of high interest and is the subject of ongoing research. Safety of therapy administered to older patients over the long term is an area that requires close scrutiny. First- line ibrutinib appears to be well tolerated with extended treatment as evidenced by over 80% of this older popula- tion being able to continue treatment for more than 2 P.M.

',\n"," 'This extended follow up allowed for new observa- tions into the timing of when AEs occurred and time to resolution of AEs as well as the use of transfusions and growth factors. Diarrhea, while frequent, often occurred early during the first several months of treatment and was generally low grade and short-lived. Severe and treatment- limiting AE rates decreased over time with extended ibru- tinib treatment. A decrease in myelotoxicity and infec- tious complications over time was also observed. This contrasts with chemoimmunotherapy-associated AEs and was importantly associated with less medical resource uti- lization of neutrophil growth factors and slightly less transfusion need despite 4 times the treatment time with ibrutinib. While the rate of atrial fibrillation increased from 6% in the primary analysis to 10%, overall, ibruti- nib dose reduction or discontinuation due to atrial fibrilla- tion was uncommon and lessened with extended treat- ment in this population of older patients with CLL. Atrial fibrillation therefore appears manageable and does not fre- quently necessitate ibrutinib discontinuation. Additional information on the management and outcomes of atrial fibrillation along with associated anticoagulant therapy has been provided in a large pooled analysis of ibrutinib studies. Rates of major hemorrhage remained low despite half the patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. Previous work demonstrated that QOL is significantly compromised in patients with CLL, affecting physical fit- ness, cognitive function, levels of fatigue, and sleep. Worse scores were reported for patients receiving chemotherapy such as chlorambucil. Even with the addition of contem- porary anti-CD20 agents (obinutuzumab), no significant benefit in QOL has been noted. However, this extended follow up provides the first analysis of QOL, as measured by FACIT Fatigue Scale, following ibrutinib treatment in previously untreated patients. Significantly greater improvements in QOL were observed with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In line with this and the favorable impact on QOL and tolerable safety profile, 79% of patients remained on first-line treatment with ibrutinib at the time of this later analysis with up to 3 years of therapy. Patients who discontinue treatment for CLL including ibrutinib may have varied outcomes dependent on the reason for discontinuation. In 1 study that included most- ly patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, median OS following ibrutinib therapy was 33 months for those who discontinued because of AEs versus 16 months for those who discontinued because of disease progression. ',\n"," 'In our study, the 22 patients who discontinued therapy had a median follow up of 13 months after discontinuation. these 22 patients, 16 are still alive, while 2 of the 4 patients who progressed have died. Seven patients have received subsequent treatment, mostly chemoimmunotherapy (BR, FCR); 6 of those patients are still alive, with a median of 21 months of follow up. While retrospective analyses of real-world data have previously suggested that treatment with an alternate kinase inhibitor is more effective than chemoimmunotherapy following discontinuation of ibru- tinib, 31,32 our data suggests that patients who discontinue ibrutinib can respond to chemoimmunotherapy as sec- ond-line therapy. Continued follow up of patients in the RESONATE-2 trial who have discontinued ibrutinib will provide the needed further data as relatively few patients have progressed or stopped therapy to date. These data confirm that first-line treatment with ibruti- nib results in long-term PFS in patients with CLL and that response quality continues to improve with ibrutinib over time, with substantial increase in patients achieving CR. In addition, rates of grade ≥3 AEs during treatment with ibrutinib decreased over time. The most common reasons for initiating first-line treatment in these patients, includ- ing marrow failure, disease burden, and disease symp- toms, all improved to greater extents in patients treated with ibrutinib versuschemotherapy. Ongoing randomized studies, including ILLUMINATE (clinicaltrials.gov identifier 02264574), comparing ibrutinib-obinutuzumab with chlo- rambucil-obinutuzumab, and A041202 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier 01886872), comparing ibrutinib, ibrutinib-ritux- imab, and rituximab-bendamustine, will continue to define the role of ibrutinib for the first-line treatment of patients with CLL/SLL.

Indolent NHL (iNHL) constitutes approximately one third of NHLs, with follicular lym- phoma (FL), the most common type, accounting for 20% to 30%. Other indolent subtypes include small lymphocyticlymphoma(SLL)andmarginalzoneB-cell lymphoma (MZL, which includes nodal and splenic marginal zone), which account for approximately 7% and4%ofallNHLs,respectively. Thediseasecourse for iNHL is variable, with some patients remaining asymptomatic for extended periods and others re- quiring immediate intervention. ',\n"," 'For more than a decade, combinations of the anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab with alkylator or purine analog-based chemotherapy regimens (ie, chemoimmunotherapy) have been the cornerstone of frontline and relapsed iNHL therapy. 4-8 With such treatment,medianprogression-freesurvival(PFS)and overall survival (OS) for FL are 6 to 8 and 12 to 15 years, respectively. However, the approximately 20% of patients with FL treated with frontline rituximab pluscyclophosphamide,doxorubicin,andprednisone (R-CHOP) who progress within 2 years of initial di- agnosis also have a lower 5-year OS rate (50%) than patients without early progression (90%).

Pathways mediated by PI3K-d and PI3K-g are involved in cell growth, migration, dif- ferentiation, and metabolism, all critical to the patho- genesisandprogressionofB-cellmalignancies. 14,15 PI3K- d inhibition targets malignant B-cell proliferation and survival through blockade of tumor cell autonomous and tumor microenvironment (TME)–mediated cytokine re- ceptor signaling, whereas PI3K-g inhibition disrupts the formationoftheTMEby inhibitingT-cellandmacrophage migration and macrophage polarization to a tumor- supporting M2 phenotype. 16-20 The TME is also impor- tant in the development and maintenance of hematologic malignancies, including iNHL. Thus, the cooperation of PI3K-g and PI3K-d in the interplay between tumor cells and the TME, and in the establishment/maintenance of the TME, makes dual inhibition an attractive therapeutic target. Duvelisib, an oral dual inhibitor of PI3K-d and -g, was approvedbytheUSFoodandDrugAdministration(FDA) inSeptember2018fortreatmentofrelapsedorrefractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or SLL after two or more prior therapies and for RR FL after two or morepriorsystemictherapies. ',\n"," 'prior therapies and for RR FL after two or morepriorsystemictherapies. Approvalof25mgtwice daily was supported by phase I findings that plasma exposure at higher doses did not further increase either response rates or markers of PI3K-d inhibition; 25 mg twice daily demonstrated clinical activity and an ac- ceptable safety profile in advanced hematologic malig- nancies in IPI-145-02 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01476657). Inthatstudy,theoverallresponserate (ORR) among 31 patients with RR iNHL treated with duvelisib monotherapy was 58.1%, including six (19.4%) complete responses (CRs). 23,24 Duvelisib’s dual mechanism of PI3K-d,-g inhibition may represent both a therapeutic advantage over selective PI3K-dinhibitors andanew alternativefor treatingB-cell malignancies. With consideration of the need for effec- tive new therapies for chemoimmunotherapy-refractory iNHL, the therapeutic value of duvelisib monotherapy in this high-risk population became the focus of the Duvelisib in Subjects With Refractory Indolent Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma (DYNAMO) study and duvelisib’s FDA approval. PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Design and Treatment DYNAMO was a single-arm, phase II, open-label study of the antitumor activity and safety of oral duvelisib mono- therapy in patients with relapsed iNHL refractory to ritux- imab (ie, no response or disease progression [PD] within 6 months after completion of therapy) and to either che- motherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT). The study was conducted at 56 sites across 12 countries in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Institutional review boards and/or ethics committees approved protocols at all sites. Study conduct followed International Conference on Har- monisationGuidelinesforGoodClinicalPractice,including writteninformedconsentfromallpatientsandrigorousdata monitoring. Oral duvelisib 25 mg twice daily was self-administered continuously in 28-day cycles until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Up to two dose reductions for the same treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were permitted. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpes zoster virus (HZV) was required. The primary end point was ORR assessed by an in- dependentreview committee (IRC) and defined asa CR or partial response (PR) per revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy end points in- cluded duration of response (DOR), PFS, OS, and time to response (TTR). Patient Eligibility Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmedFL,SLL,orMZL(splenic,nodal,andextranodal) andradiologicallymeasurablediseasewithalymphnodeor tumor mass greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in at least one dimension.Patientswithgrade3BFLorclinicalevidenceof transformation to an aggressive lymphoma subtype were excluded.

Response was based on revised IWG response criteria for NHL using consistent imaging: computed to- mography, positron emission tomography/computed to- mography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Safety assessments included physical examinations, elec- trocardiograms, and adverse event (AE) and clinical lab- oratory monitoring. Severity of TEAEs and laboratory abnormalities was graded using the National Cancer In- stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). An independent data monitoring com- mittee reviewed all safety information. After treatment discontinuation,survivaldatawerecollectedevery6months for up to 3 years from treatment initiation. Statistical Methods Using a group sequential design with one interim analysis, 120 patients provided more than 90% power to test the hypothesisofanORRgreaterthanorequalto45%against the null hypothesis of an ORR less than or equal to 30% at a one-sided overall significance level of .025. A P value and a two-sided 95% exact CI for ORR were calculated using the binomial distribution. Best tumor response (CR, PR, stable disease, or PD) was assessed for each patient. PFS was the time from first duvelisib dose to first documentation of PD or any-cause death. DOR was the time from first documentation of best response (CR or PR) to first documentation of PD or any- cause death. OS was the time from first dose to date of death, and TTR was the time from first dose to first doc- umentation of response. The lymph node response rate (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the sum of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions of the target lesion) also was calculated, and time-to-event end points were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

The final analysis was per- formed after the last enrolled patient completed 6 months oftherapy orexperiencedPD; thesedata, with2additional years of follow-up, are presented here, with an analysis cutoff date of May 2018. RESULTS Patient Characteristics From June 2013 to October 2015, 129 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of duvelisib. His- tologic subtypes included FL (83 patients), SLL (28 pa- tients), and MZL (18 patients). Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most patients (68.2%) were male, 89.9% were white, and themedianagewas65years(range,30to90years).Most patients (85%) had advanced-stage (III or IV) iNHL, and 67% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 (94.6%) or 2 (5.4%) at enrollment. Among patientswithFL,87%wereintermediateorhighriskperthe Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. Patients had received a median of three (range, one to 18) priorsystemicanticancerregimens,and52patients(40%) received four or more prior regimens. Nearly two thirds of patients had prior bendamustine (82 patients [64%]). Common prior regimens were rituximab plus bendamus- tine(64patients[50%]),R-CHOP(48patients[37%]),and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide and prednisone (38 patients [30%]). Six patients (5%) had prior autologous stem-cell transplantation. Nearlyallpatientshaddiseaserefractorytorituximabeither aloneorincombination(127patients[98%]),119patients (92%) had disease refractory to an alkylating agent or purine analog, and 117 patients (91%) had disease re- fractory to combination therapy with rituximab and an alkylating agent. Nearly all patients had disease refractory to the most recent regimen (124 patients [96%]), and 95 patients (77%) had disease refractory to two or more reg- imens. Among the 39 patients with FL who received an R-CHOP (or equivalent) chemoimmunotherapy regimen as first therapy, 30 (77%) experienced early relapse (no responseduringtreatmentorPDortimetonexttreatment lessthan2years).Nonotabledifferencesindemographics were observed across lymphoma subtypes. Disposition Of 171 screened patients, 42 were excluded as a result of screen failures, yielding 129 in the full analysis set. of the May 2018 data cutoff, five patients were still on treatment. Of the 124 who discontinued treatment, ap- proximately one half (66 patients [51.2%]) did so because ofPD; one fourth (31 patients [24%]) because of AEs; and the remaining one fourth because of investigator decision, death, patient withdrawal, or noncompliance. As of May 2018, 33 patients (25.6%) remained in the survival follow- up (Appendix Fig A1, online only). Efficacy Medianfollow-uptime(fromfirstdoseuntillastcontactdate or death) was 32.1 months.

',\n"," 'Five deaths (3.9%) were considered treatment related: a 90-year-old man developed fatal pancolitis, an 82-year-old man experienced a fatal sus- pected viral infection after approximately 8 months of treatment, and an 83-year-old man with baseline grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia experienced fatal septic shock after only 21 days of treatment. The remaining two deaths were from severe skin toxicity as a result of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. However, both events were confounded by concomitant administration of medications associated with severe and fatal drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. One additional treatment-related death as a result of pneumonia occurred approximately 36 days after the last dose of duvelisib. DISCUSSION Although most patients with iNHL initially respond to chemoimmunotherapy and experience long periods of remission, virtually all will eventually progress or develop recurrentdisease. 27,28 Despiteseveralapprovedoptionsfor relapsed iNHL, cumulative toxicities from multiple thera- pies and resistance or transformation to high-grade or aggressive lymphomas remain major challenges. 29,30 With fewpatientseligibleforpotentiallycurativeallogeneicstem- cell transplantation, new therapies are needed. The DYNAMO study evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral duvelisib monotherapy in patients whose disease had become refractory to standard therapies and, therefore, represent the greatest unmet need. Among a heavily pretreated and high-risk iNHL study population, the ORR was 47% (two CRs, 59 PRs), and lymph node disease was reducedin83%ofpatients.Responsesgenerallyoccurred within the first 2 months of therapy and were durable (median DOR, 10 months). The safety profile was similar across lymphoma subtypes andconsistentwiththatobservedinthephaseIIPI-145-02 study. 23,24 AEs were generally low grade and manageable with protocol-specified risk mitigation measures, including dose reductions/interruptions (70% of patients).

Among patients with FL, 27 (33%) experienced early progression (less than 2 years after initial diagnosis) after frontline R-CHOP(orequivalent)therapyandrepresentapopulation with substantially poorer OS. This extent of treatment re- fractoriness and the prevalence of other high-risk clinical features (eg, high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk and elevated lactate dehydrogenase) distinguish a more difficult-to-treat study population. examination of efficacy in the subgroup of patients with FL who received R-CHOP (or the equivalent) as their first therapy and experienced early relapse (as defined in Discussion) showed an ORR of 33%, median DOR of 12.6 months, and median PFS of 8.2 months. With the recent FDA approval of duvelisib, there are now several different treatment options for patients who have received two or more prior therapies: in addition to duve- lisib,thePI3Kinhibitorscopanlisib(intravenousinhibitorof PI3K-a,-d)andidelalisib(oralinhibitorofPI3K-d).Although these three new treatment options are important for both physicians and patients, evaluating them side by side for the treatment of FL is challenging because cross-trial comparisons are undermined by variability in patient se- lection and treatments. For instance, in the phase II CHRONOS-1 study, copanlisib demonstrated an ORR of 59%. Although prior rituximab and alkylator therapy was required, only 56% and 42% of patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab and an alkylating agent, re- spectively. In addition, the AE profile of copanlisib, specifically including hyperglycemic effects mediated through PI3K-a isoform inhibition 33,34 and hypertension, merits consideration before use in an elderly patient populationwithahighprevalenceofthesecomorbidities.In a phase II trial in patients with disease refractory to both rituximab and chemotherapy, idelalisib demonstrated an ORR of 57%. The AE profile was similar to duvelisib, except for a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher ami- notransferase increase with idelalisib (13% v 5.4%). Al- though many new therapies are being investigated for patients with RR indolent lymphoma (lenalidomide and rituximab, cellular therapies, bispecific antibodies, and other small molecules), treatment options beyond the PI3Kinhibitorsarestilllimited.RITrarelyisused,andone of the two FDA-approved therapies was withdrawn from the market for lack of use. The cumulative toxicities and decreasing efficacy of repeating cytotoxic chemotherapy, even combined with a different CD20 antibody like obi- nutuzumab, does not make this an attractive choice either. ',\n"," 'Thecombinationofobinutuzumabandbendamustinewas recentlyapprovedforpatientswithFLwhorelapsedafteror whose disease proved refractory to a rituximab-containing regimen on the basis of the results of the GADOLIN (Efficacy and Safety of Bendamustine Compared With Bendamustine + Obinutuzumab [GA101] in Rituximab- Refractory, Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) study. Given that the bendamustine and rituximab regimen is increasingly used as first-line treatment of FL in the United States, duvelisib monotherapy may offer an alternative for the considerable number of patients whose disease is re- fractory to bendamustine or who are unable to tolerate bendamustine. Patients previously treated with bend- amustine had an ORR of 39% per IRC. Although this was nominally lower than what was seen in patients not pre- viously exposed to bendamustine, it nevertheless suggests that duvelisib has clinical activity for a population not ap- propriate for treatment with bendamustine therapy. Despite recent therapeutic advances, iNHL remains largely incurable, with treatment resistance and cumu- lative toxicity limiting options for many patients.

',\n"," 'beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan, a component of the fungal cell wall, has been shown to stimulate the immune system, enhance hematopoiesis, amplify killing of opsonized tumor cells and increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion. In view of these attributes, the beta-glucans should be studied for both their therapeutic efficacy in patients with cancer as well as an adjunctive therapy in patients receiving chemotherapy as a maneuver to limit suppression of hematopoiesis. In this study, twenty patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy were given a beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan preparation (MacroForce plus IP6, ImmuDyne, Inc.) and monitored for tolerability and effect on hematopoiesis. Our results lead us to conclude that beta-glucan is well-tolerated in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, may have a beneficial effect on hematopoiesis in these patients and should be studied further, especially in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan is a long chain polymer of glucose from the fungal cell wall which has been shown to have a number of immunomodulatory properties as well as effects on hematopoiesis and as a radiation protectant. It has been well-demonstrated that the beta-glucans increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, synergize with myeloid growth factors to enhance hematopoiesis and mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells in vivo, directly stimulate committed myeloid progenitor cells and improve survival and hematopoietic regeneration in irradiated mice. Furthermore, the beta-glucans have been shown to amplify the phagocytic killing of opsonized tumor cells and combine with monoclonal antibodies to increase their tumoricidal activity. Based on these properties, this study was designed to test the safety of an adjunctive treatment with beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. In addition, because the beta-glucans have been shown to improve hematopoiesis in animals and because chemotherapy generally induces cytopenias in humans, we also sought to determine if the beta-glucan administered in this study exerted an effect on blood counts in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy compared with pretreatment blood counts in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Twenty patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy received the beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan preparation, MacroForce plus IP6 (ImmuDyne, Mount Kisco, NY), one tablet twice a day by mouth after granting informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Group.

Specifically, patients were asked to report any new symptoms not experienced prior to initiation of the study and to note if any prior chemotherapy-related symptoms (e.g. nausea and vomiting) had changed after the intiation of the study. If grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity developed, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1000 uL or a platelet count of less than 50,000 uL, therapy would be withheld until the toxicity resolved. After resolution, dosing would be reduced to one tablet by mouth per day. Mean changes in blood counts during the study were compared to the mean blood counts observed prior to the initiation of the study. The primary endpoint was to determine the tolerability of the treatment and its effect on serial blood counts. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient for publication of this study. Table 1 demonstrates the characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study. Table 2 notes the types of malignancies experienced by these patients and the treatments they were receiving. None of the twenty patients reported any new symptoms while taking the beta-glucan. Sixty per cent of the patients reported a sense of well-being while taking the beta-glucan and asked to remain on the treatment even after the completion of the study. Forty per cent of the patients who experienced fatigue during their chemotherapy treatments prior to entering the study reported feeling less fatigued while taking the beta-glucan. In addition, one patient with lymphoma and significant cervical adenopathy who delayed his standard chemotherapy for 4 weeks during the study and only took the beta-glucan, noted a marked reduction in the size of the nodes while taking the beta-glucan alone. Table 3 shows the comparison of the mean blood counts prior to entering the study with the mean blood counts during the study. As can be seen, in general, there was a trend to improved blood counts during the study as compared with the pre-study period. ',\n"," 'improvement especially of the white blood count during the study period on this dose of beta-glucan. Improvements were also noted in the levels of hemoglobin and the platelet counts. The beta-glucans are long-chain polymers of glucose in beta-(1,3)(1,6) linkages which comprise the fungal cell wall. These glucans have been studied for their ability stimulate hematopoiesis, protect against radiation injury and amplify killing of opsonized tumor cells. It has been shown that these glucans can increase neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion in several in vivo and in vitro systems. In addition, betafectin PGG-glucan was able to synergize with myeloid growth factors in vivo to enhance hematopoietic recovery and mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells. Treatment with glucans in mice has been shown to increase survival and improve hematopoietic regeneration after irradiation and that the glucans act directly on commited myeloid progenitors to improve hematopoiesis. The effects of glucans on tumor cell killing has included the observation that yeast beta-glucan amplifies phagocytic killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells, combine with monoclonal antibodies to increase tumor cell death and can increase macrophage cytotoxicity to tumor cells by increasing nitrous oxide production. Interestingly, toxicological assessment of a particulate yeast (1,3)-beta-D-glucan in rats revealed no adverse or toxic effects on the animals. The specific aim of this study was to determine the safety and side effect profile of beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy and the effect of the glucan on hemtopoiesis in these patients. Furthermore, because the beta-glucans also have immunomodulatory effects as noted above, we monitored patients for any therapeutic effect of the glucan even though this was an uncontrolled trial and this was not a specific aim of the treatment paradigm. This trial demonstrates that beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan is extremely well-tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. No adverse effects or toxicities were reported by any of the patients when compared to their symptom profile before entering the study. On the contrary, a significant number of patients reported a sense of well-being while taking the glucan, an effect which should be studied further in a larger, controlled trial. There clearly was some amelioration of the blood counts in patients taking the glucan as compared to the pretreatment mean counts. This effect supports the data from animal studies which demonstrates that the beta-glucans improve hematopoiesis through a variety of mechanisms. ',\n"," 'This effect should also be studied in a larger, controlled trial because if confirmed, the beta-glucans could become an important adjunctive treatment in patients receiving chemotherapy to limit the cytopenias observed with these therapies. Lastly, because of the immunomodulatory properties of the glucans, these agents may have direct tumoricidal properties which deserve further investigation in a larger population in a controlled setting. Our anecdotal experience in one patient with lymphoma and enlarged cervical nodes who noted marked improvement on the beta-glucan alone is extremely interesting at the very least. We conclude that beta-(1,3)/(1,6) D-glucan can be safely administered to patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy and that this adjunctive therapy may have beneficial effects on the blood counts in these patients. Further studies are warranted in a larger patient population to confirm this latter finding and to determine if the beta-glucans have tumoricidal effects in humans. ',\n"," 'MGCD0103, an orally available class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was examined for pre-clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). A phase II clinical trial was performed, starting at a dose of 85 mg/day, three times per week. Dose escalation to 110 mg or the addition of rituximab was permitted in patients without a response after 2 or more cycles. MGCD0103 demonstrated pre-clinical activity against CLL cells with a LC50 (concentration lethal to 50%) of 0.23 muM and increased acetylation of the HDAC class I specific target histone H3. Twenty-one patients received a median of 2 cycles of MGCD0103 (range, 0-12). All patients had previously received fludarabine, 33% were fludarabine refractory, and 71% had del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1). No responses according to the National Cancer Institutes 1996 criteria were observed. Three patients received 110 mg and 4 patients received concomitant rituximab, with no improvement in response. Grade 3-4 toxicity consisted of infections, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, and fatigue. HDAC inhibition was observed in 6 out of 9 patients on day 8. Limited activity was observed with single agent MGCD0103 in high risk patients with CLL. Future investigations in CLL should focus on broad HDAC inhibition, combination strategies, and approaches to diminish constitutional symptoms associated with this class of drugs. Historically, loss of tumour suppressor genes and genomic silencing via DNA mutation or deletion have been thought to contribute to tumorigenesis by permitting apoptotic escape, sustained growth, limitless replication, immunological evasion, and metastasis of the malignant cell. However, epigenetic modifications that favour transcriptionally repressive chromatin are also common in neoplastic transformation, particularly in B-cell malignancies. CpG island promoter methylation and post-translational modifications of histone proteins alter chromatin conformation, favouring transcriptional repression and genomic silencing. Eukaryotic DNA is condensed 10,000-fold via the nucleosome, a histone octamer consisting of a histone H3 and H4 tetramer and two histone H2A and H2B dimers. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins including histone acetylation are critical to transcriptional regulation of genes. Histone acetylation and histone deacyetylation regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) leads to either transcriptionally active hyperacetylated chromatin or transcriptionally repressive hypoacetylated chromatin, respectively. ',\n"," 'Four classes of HDACs remove acetyl groups from lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histones in protein repressor and chromatin remodeling complexes including HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8 (class I isotypes located within the nucleus); HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 (class II isotypes which shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus), Sirt 1 to 7 (class III istoypes), and HDAC 11 (class IV isotype). While genomic deletions and mutations irreversibly alter the sequence of a gene, histone modifications can be readily targeted by therapies that inhibit histone deacetylation. In addition to nuclear modification of histone proteins, several of the class II HDAC enzymes can also alter acetylation on cytoplasmic proteins. Given the robust number of proteins targeted by HDAC isotypes, agents that target HDAC enzymes represent a novel target for anti-cancer therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors, including depsipeptide (a potent inhibitor of class I HDAC enzymes), MS-275 (a selective class I HDAC inhibitor), and valproic acid (a non-selective HDAC inhibitor), can alter histone modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lead to selective cytotoxicity of CLL cells. Depsipeptide has led to reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, a dose-dependent increase in acetylation of total histone H4, and inhibition of global HDAC activity. Depsipeptide-induced apoptosis in CLL appears to occur through activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8, with minimal alteration in caspase 9 activity. Therefore, the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide utilizes the tumour necrosis factor-receptor pathway of apoptosis to activate caspase 8, which leads to recruitment of caspase 3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). The observation that depsipeptide operates via a caspase 8-mediated process is significant, as this pathway is not activated by other agents currently used in the treatment of CLL, which more frequently activate the mitochondrial/caspase 9-dependent pathway of apoptosis. MGCD0103 is an orally available, aminophenylbenzamide small molecule HDAC inhibitor that selectively targets class I (HDAC isotypes 1, 2, and 3) and class IV (HDAC isotype 11) enzymes. In pre-clinical testing, intermittent dosing schedules have led to sustained dose-dependent growth inhibition in a variety of human cancer cell lines and implanted tumors in mice. Previously conducted phase I trials of MGCD0103 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and solid tumours have evaluated three times per week dosing schedules with dose levels ranging from 12.5 - 80 mg/m2/day every 21 days. ',\n"," 'schedules with dose levels ranging from 12.5 - 80 mg/m2/day every 21 days. Maximum tolerated doses were 60 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2/day in AML and solid tumours, respectively, with dose-limiting toxicities consisting of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Using fixed MGCD0103 dosing, the recommended phase 2 doses were 110 mg in AML and 85 mg in solid tumours. As a result of the compelling evidence supporting the role of epigenetic silencing in CLL and the feasibility of intermittent dosing in patients with AML and solid tumours, a multi-centre phase II trial of MGCD103 was conducted in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL to determine the overall response rate. In addition, in patients not initially responding to MGCD0103, combination therapy with rituximab and MGCD0103 was explored with the therapeutic rationale that MGCD0103 and rituximab induce apoptosis through different pathways and have non-overlapping toxicities. While HDAC inhibitors induce apoptosis in CLL cells through activation of caspase 8 and 3, rituximab-induced CLL apoptosis occurs through the caspase 9 effector pathway. In addition, declines in Mcl-1 following rituximab therapy may further sensitize CLL cells to MGCD0103 cytotoxicity. Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL, following written informed consent. Leukemic B-cells were negatively selected using RosetteSep reagent (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). Cells were incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin, and 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and immunoblots were performed as described andLC50 (concentration lethal to 50%) was calculated using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Antibodies including acetylated tubulin (Sigma) acetylated H3 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), and GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Patients 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed CLL, relapsed or refractory after at least one prior nucleoside-analog containing therapy (unless nucleoside analogs were contraindicated) and requiring treatment according to National Cancer Institutes (NCI) criteria were enrolled. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, a total bilirubin <= 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <= 2.5 x ULN, and a serum creatinine <= 1.5 x ULN. ',\n"," 'The institutional review boards of all participating centres approved the trial and all patients provided written informed consent as per institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients received MGCD0103 at a starting dose of 85 mg three times per week (TIW) for four weeks. Twenty-eight days defined a cycle. Dose escalation to 110 mg TIW was permitted beginning with cycle 2 in patients who failed to achieve a complete response (CR) and who had no grade 2 or higher adverse events. In patients without evidence of response after dose escalation to 110 mg (unless dose escalation was contra-indicated due to toxicity), rituximab was administered. Rituximab dosing started at 100 mg over 4 h on day 1, followed by 375 mg/m2 days 3, 5, and then three times a week for a maximum of 12 doses. Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Anti-emetic, anti-diarrhoeal, and hematopoietic growth factor support were provided at the discretion of the treating physician. In patients with grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, MGCD0103 was withheld until improvement of the toxicity to <= grade 1. For subsequent cycles, dose reduction by either one (60mg) or two (40mg) dose levels was required for the first and second events, respectively. Dose reduction below 40 mg was not permitted and grade 4 non-hematological toxicity necessitated study removal. In patients with pre-treatment platelet count > 75 x 109/l and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 2.0 x 109/l, the development of grade 4 cytopenias persisting for more than 7 days required cessation of MGCD0103 until hematological recovery defined as >= 75% of baseline or <= grade 1. At resumption of therapy, patients were dose-reduced by one dose level to either 60 or 40 mg of MGCD0103. In patients with baseline pre-treatment platelet counts <= 75 x 109/l or ANC <= 2.0 x 109/l, cytopenias < 75% of baseline led to cessation of MGCD0103 therapy until recovery to >= 75% of baseline or <= grade 1. Treatment resumed at the next lower dose level, but dose reductions below 40 mg required study removal. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and liver function tests were monitored weekly during the first two cycles of therapy and with dose escalation to 110 mg or the addition of rituximab. Starting with cycle 3, blood counts, chemistries, and liver function tests were assessed on days 1 and 15. ',\n"," 'Twelve lead electrocardiograms were performed pre-treatment; prior to dosing, 1- and 2-h post-dose on day 1 of cycles 1-2; and prior to dosing for cycles 3 and beyond. Response was assessed according to the revised NCI Working Group Criteria after every cycle, with bone marrow biopsy repeated to confirm CR or after every 4 cycles of therapy. Hematological and non-hematological toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf). Peripheral blood evaluations of whole cell HDAC enzyme activity and cytokine analysis were assessed pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 8, and at completion of protocol therapy. Bone marrow aspirations were collected pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 8, and at end of study therapy were used to qualify changes in HDAC activity over time. Whole cell HDAC enzyme assays were performed as previously described. Plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from eBioscience San Diego, CA). This study was a multi-institutional single-arm phase II study designed to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) with MGCD0103 in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The study was designed according to Simon\\'s two-stage design, targeting a true response probability of >= 20%, with null hypothesis that the true response rate was < 5 %.\"] The study had a type 1 error rate of 5% and power of 90%. According to the study design, study closure was required if fewer than 2 responses were observed in the first 21 patients. If sufficient responses were observed in stage 1, a total study enrollment of 41 patients was planned, with observation of 5 or more responses considered worthy of further evaluation. CLL cells from untreated patients (n=8) were incubated for 72 hours with or without various concentrations of MGCD0103, and viability was assessed by MTT assay. Under these conditions, the LC50 was 0.23 muM (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.31) relative to time-matched controls. To assess acetylation of known HDAC class I and II targets, CLL patient cells (n=4) were treated with MGCD0103 at several concentrations. Lysates were prepared after a 16-h incubation, prior to the time when cell death is observed by annexin/PI flow cytometry data (data not shown). By immunoblot analysis, MGCD0103 treatment induced acetylation of the HDAC class I substrate histone H3 but not the class II target tubulin (Figure 1). ',\n"," 'These data confirm that at the doses examined, MGCD0103 causes class I HDAC target hyperacetylation followed by cell death. Twenty-one patients completed a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range 0-12). Three patients were dose escalated to 110 mg and 4 patients received rituximab beginning in cycle 4 (range, 2-8 doses) for lack of response to single agent MGCD0103. In the twenty-one patients, the median age was 63 (range, 48-80) years and 20 patients had Rai stage 3-4 disease (Table 1). Most patients were heavily pre-treated, receiving a median of 5 prior therapies (range, 1-13) and 13 (62%) patients failed to respond to the prior treatment regimen. No patients were previously transplanted. All 21 patients had received fludarabine, and seven (33%) patients failed to respond to their last fludarabine-containing regimen. The majority of patients had adverse cytogenetics, with 15 (71%) patients with either del(11q22.3) or del(17p13.1), and 3 patients with both deletion 11q and 17p (Table 1). In the cohort of 21 patients, there were no complete or partial responses. Twenty patients had stable disease, and no improvement in response occurred with either MGCD0103 dose escalation or the addition of rituximab. Median pre- and post-treatment white blood cell, absolute lymphocyte, and platelet counts were 30.6 x 109/l and 34 x 109/l (white blood cells); 27.5 x 109/l and 31.3 x 109/l (absolute lymphocyte count); and 49 x 109/l and 38 x 109/l) (platelets), respectively. Four patients who received 5, 2, 2, and 1 cycles of MGCD0103 had 73.4%, 36.7%, 93.9%, and 55.4% declines, respectively, in absolute lymphocyte counts. All of these patients stopped therapy due to toxicity including infection, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. In addition, four patients with stable disease were also able to continue MGCD0103 for 5, 7, 9 and 12 cycles, respectively. Fifty-nine MGCD0103 cycles were completed. Six patients required dose reduction by one dose level to 60 mg three times a week, 1 patient required two dose reductions to 40 mg three times a week, and 16 patients had dosing delays primarily due to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), fatigue, anorexia, infections, or thrombocytopenia. There were no treatment-related deaths. Grade 3-4 hematological events included thrombocytopenia (29%), anemia (29%), and neutropenia (5%, Table 2). Non-hematological grade 3 or 4 adverse events were uncommon (Table 2), with infection (39%), febrile neutropenia (20%), diarrhoea (10%), fatigue (10%), and abdominal pain (5%) occurring most frequently. ',\n"," 'The majority of the grade 1-2 adverse events were also gastrointestinal, constitutional, or infectious, including diarrhoea (n=16), nausea (n=16), non-neutropenic infections (n=13), anorexia (n=10), vomiting (n=7), rash (n=10), fatigue (n=7), abdominal pain (n=6), weight loss (n=5), headache (n=5), and oedema (n=5). With respect to cardiac complications, no evidence of QT prolongation was observed. Only three patients experienced cardiac events. One patient, with a history of pulmonary hypertension that was probably secondary to bronchiectasis, developed grade 3 right ventricular failure with pleural effusions and oedema that was thought to be related to the pre-existing pulmonary disease. A second patient with a history of hypertension developed a grade 1 asymptomatic pericardial effusion on echocardiogram that resolved after discontinuation of the study drug and a third patient developed grade 2 ventricular tachycardia and grade 2 bradycardia in the setting of grade 4 influenza and bacterial meningitis. Infections were common, with 2 deaths attributed to pneumonia. Reported grade 3-5 infections were febrile neutropenia (n=4), pneumonia (n=3), influenza (n=2), meningitis (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), and methicillin-resistant Stapholoccocus epidermidis bacteremia (n=1). Grade 1-2 infections included pneumonia (n=3), urinary tract infections (n=3), sinusitis (n=2), otitis externa (n=1), oral candidasis (n=1), orchitis/epididymitis (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), and folliculitis (n=1). Bone marrow basal HDAC activity levels were comparable to those in peripheral white blood cells in the same patients (Table 3). The mean change in HDAC enzyme inhibition in 9 patients with pre-treatment and post-treatment (day 8) samples available was 24.5% (range -5.5% to 51.5%, Figure 2). In 6 of these 9 patients, HDAC inhibition greater than 20% was observed relative to pre-treatment values (Figure 2). In 21 patients, pre-treatment IL-6 plasma levels varied (ranging from < 1ng/l to 155.8 ng/l). IL-6 levels failed to correlate with fatigue; however, in 5 of 6 patients with grades 3-4 fever, IL-6 levels were increased 10-fold compared to pre-treatment levels. Preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors in CLL in vitro has been published by several groups. In a clinical trial with depsipeptide, a class I specific HDAC inhibitor, modest evidence of clinical efficacy was demonstrated, but problematic fatigue and cardiac toxicity has limited its further development. Due to this toxicity, alternative class I HDAC inhibitors, including MGCD0103, are under evaluation in CLL. In the current study, pre-clinical activity in CLL cells was demonstrated, with loss of tumor cell viability and hyperacetylation of histone H3 after MGCD0103 exposure. ',\n"," 'This pre-clinical efficacy justified the pursuit of the herein described multi-center phase II trial of MGCD0103 in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. Unfortunately in this phase II trial, limited single agent efficacy was observed, with stable disease in 20 of 21 patients after 0-12 cycles of MGCD0103. Prolonged administration for 5 or more cycles, dose escalation to 110 mg, and the addition of rituximab failed to improve MGCD0103\\'s activity.\"] Collectively, this study, together with the previous trial of the more potent class I HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide, suggests that alternative strategies using HDAC inhibitors in patients with CLL will be required including pursuit of non-selective or broad HDAC isotype inhibition or combination strategies based upon pre-clinical synergy studies with other novel targeted therapies. Although four patients did demonstrate reductions lymphocyte count that could be construed as clinical benefit, constitutional symptoms associated with MGCD0103 were significant and frequently led to cessation of therapy. Despite the prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-life of MGCD0103 when compared to other HDAC inhibitors, which permits three times a week rather than daily oral dosing, dose escalation and re-treatment with MGCD0103 in this trial were often prohibited by these side effects including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, and severe fatigue. Such toxicities are similarly found with other class I HDAC inhibitors including depsipeptide in patients with CLL and in previous MGCD0103 phase I and II trials in AML, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumours. In these trials, maximal or sustained HDAC inhibition with optimal steady state dose levels may not have been achievable due to toxicity, suggesting that alternative prolonged dosing schedules of HDAC inhibitors may enhance the clinical activity and HDAC enzyme inhibition with these agents in patients with CLL. In the current trial, the majority of patients could only tolerate up to 2 cycles of MGCD0103; however, four patients remained on study for 5-12 cycles, with no additional efficacy observed despite prolonged dosing in these 4 patients. In pharmacodynamic evaluations in patient-derived peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells in 6 of 9 patients with available samples on this trial, greater than 20% inhibition of HDAC activity was observed. It remains unclear if the 20% threshold is sufficient for therapeutic efficacy and further evaluation is warranted. ',\n"," 'Therefore, despite intermittent three times a week dosing of MGCD0103 that permitted several patients to remain on study for 5 or more cycles and preliminary evidence of HDAC inhibition, efficacy with this agent was limited in CLL, suggesting that either combination strategies with class I HDAC inhibitors or use of non-selective HDAC inhibitors may be necessary to fully appreciate the benefit of this class of agents in patients with relapsed CLL. Additionally, efforts to understand and effectively eliminate the constitutional symptoms observed with class I specific HDAC inhibitors in CLL will be important for prolonged therapy to be feasible. The lack of response with MGCD0103 as a single agent in CLL raises the question of how to continue development of HDAC inhibitors in CLL. Combination strategies with HDAC inhibitors are currently in development in other hematological malignancies including combinations of HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, cell cycle regulatory agents (i.e. flavopiridol), anti-apoptotic agents, bortezomib, and conventional chemotherapeutic agents. These combination strategies may synergize with respect to inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity, ultimately permitting the use of less frequent and smaller doses of HDAC inhibitors which may not only improve the clinical efficacy of these agents but also limit cumulative toxicity. While consideration of HDAC inhibitor combinations with flavopiridol are reasonable given the clinical activity of this agent in CLL, alternative agents, such as bortezomib or the hypomethylating agent decitabine, are less attractive due to the lack of single agent activity. In a subset of patients on this trial, the addition of rituximab to MGCD0103 was well tolerated, and this may also be incorporated into future combination approaches. ',\n"," 'Based on the hypothesis that bortezomib may potentiate fludarabine activity by inhibiting DNA repair, we designed a phase I trial using this combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory indolent and mantle cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes included 12 patients with follicular, 4 with marginal zone, 3 with lymphoplasmacytic, 3 with mantle cell and 2 with small lymphocytic / chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fludarabine and bortezomib were escalated in cohorts of 3 patients. Rituximab was added to the maximum tolerated dose of fludarabine and bortezomib and added significant dose-limiting myelosuppression. The maximum tolerated dose was fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11, with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 administered every 21 days. Clinical responses were observed in 11 patients, 5 of whom were refractory to their most recent treatment regimen. Six additional patients had stable disease for a median of 10 months (range 4-30+). Cumulative myelosuppression and neuropathy was observed. Fludarabine, bortezomib, and rituximab appears to be an active regimen with manageable toxicity for relapsed NHL. The indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) traditionally include follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic and small lymphocytic histological subtypes. They are defined by their chemosensitive nature and slowly progressive course. Despite a wide variety of treatment options, most patients ultimately succumb to their disease. In comparison, mantle cell lymphoma is considerably more aggressive than the indolent NHLs and less responsive to currently available therapy. As new treatment options with novel targets and non-overlapping toxicities are developed, the armamentarium of effective salvage therapies is steadily increasing. However, the most effective and least toxic of these regimens has yet to be defined. Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid that is a specific and selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. It is the first of the proteasome inhibitors to be used clinically and has demonstrated considerable efficacy in the treatment of indolent and mantle cell NHL. This data led to the FDA approval of bortezomib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib affects malignant cells through multiple mechanisms including the regulation of proteins involved in cell cycle progression (p21, p27), oncogenesis (p53, IkB) and apoptosis (Bcl-2, cIAP, XIAP, Bax). In addition, bortezomib may act by inhibiting DNA repair kinases (DNA-PKcs, ATM). ',\n"," 'Further, pre-clinical data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may serve as a regulator for DNA damage repair, supporting the use of bortezomib in combination with cytotoxic agents. Fludarabine is a potent cytotoxic agent which acts by inhibiting DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, thus terminating DNA strand replication. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line models, synergistic cytotoxicity has been observed with the combination of fludarabine and bortezomib. Bortezomib may inhibit repair of the fludarabine induced DNA lesions, thereby enhancing its anti-neoplastic effect. Other potential synergistic mechanisms include down-regulation of XIAP and up-regulation of Bid, resulting in enhanced apoptosis. In vitro data suggest that down-regulation of the NF-kB pathway, a known result of proteasome inhibition, may reverse fludarabine resistance. Rituximab in combination with bortezomib, appears to be well tolerated given non-overlapping toxicities. Further, synergistic apoptosis has been observed pre-clinically when bortezomib was added to a rituximab-containing combination. We therefore initiated a phase I study of fludarabine, bortezomib and rituximab in relapsed and refractory indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma. This phase I trial was designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of bortezomib in combination with rituximab and fludarabine. Secondary objectives included overall response and clinical benefit rates. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and written informed consent was obtained before enrollment. Patients 18 years of age or older with a confirmed indolent NHL (including grade 1 or 2 follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic and small lymphocytic / chronic lymphocytic leukemia) who had relapsed or had been refractory (defined as no response, or progression within 6 months of completing therapy) to at least 1 standard therapy were candidates for this study. Also included were patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, aside from those with the blastic variant. Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and to have measurable disease. Baseline laboratory parameters included an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/muL, platelets >= 75,000/muL, and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients were excluded for the following conditions: radiation, chemotherapy, or monoclonal antibody therapy within the previous 4 weeks or radioimmunotherapy within the previous 3 months; previous bortezomib therapy; a history of uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension; grade 2 or higher neuropathy; prior allogeneic transplant; CNS lymphoma; serious infection including HIV disease; pregnancy or breast feeding.

It was administered by intravenous push over 5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 followed by a 10 days rest period. Fludarabine was handled as directed by the package insert and material safety data sheet and administered at 25 mg/m2 intravenously as a 30 minute infusion daily for 3 or 5 days of each 21 day cycle. Rituximab was handled as directed by the package insert and material safety data sheet and administered at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle per a standardized infusion protocol. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or to a maximum of 8 cycles. Hematopoetic growth factors were not allowed during cycle one and were administered at the treating physician's discretion thereafter. Dose escalation is depicted in Table 1. Cohorts of 3-6 patients were treated at each dose level. For dose escalation to proceed, 3 patients had to complete cycle 1 without a DLT. If one DLT was observed, then an additional 3 patients were accrued, and further escalation occurred if no additional DLTs were seen. If DLT was observed in 2 of 3-6 patients enrolled at a specific dose level during cycle 1, that step was considered the dose-limiting level. A total of 6 patients were treated at the dose below the DLT level, thus establishing the MTD. Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. DLT was defined as any grade 3 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity and grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurring within the first cycle. Grade 4 lymphopenia and anemia were not considered DLTs. The MTD was defined as one dose level below the level determined to be the DLT. Assessment of response was performed after every 2 cycles of treatment. Response was defined using the International Workshop NHL criteria. For patients with CLL, the National Cancer Institute working group guidelines were used to determine a response. Time to disease progression was calculated as the number of months from the initiation of therapy to the first documentation of disease progression, death regardless of cause or change in therapy, whichever occurred first. Twenty-four patients were enrolled onto the study between July 2003 and July 2008. \",\n"," 'Patient characteristics are listed in Table 2. The mean age was 62 (range, 36-87) years and 13 patients were >60 years old. All patients were assessable for toxicity. Patients received an average of 3.5 cycles (range, 1-8) and 20 patients who received 2 or more cycles were assessable for clinical response. The mean number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range, 1-7). Twenty-three patients had previously received rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan, 8 patients had previously received fludarabine. Twelve patients were refractory to their most recent treatment. Of these, 10 patients were refractory to rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan and 2 to fludarabine. Five patients had failed an autologous stem cell transplant. Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities are depicted in Tables 3 and 4. No DLTs were observed on dose steps 1 through 4. With the addition of rituximab at dose level 5, 2 patients experienced DLTs including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient as well as neutropenia and neuropathy in another. After independent review and consultation with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, dose steps 5a and 5b were added in which doses of fludarabine and bortezomib were attenuated. Nine additional patients were treated, 3 at level 5a and 6 at 5b. One additional DLT, grade 3 dyspnea, was observed at the dose 5b. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity, with neutropenia being dose limiting. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 24% and 17% of cycles respectively and appeared to be cumulative in nature. Six patients received filgrastim or pegylated filgrastim support after demonstrating prolonged neutropenia during the first cycle of therapy, 4 of whom were treated on rituximab containing dose levels. Five patients were removed from the study due to prolonged myelosuppression, preventing initiation of the subsequent cycle within the protocol specified 5 week time period. As expected, all patients developed grade 3/4 lymphopenia. The major non-hematologic toxicities were neurologic and infectious in etiology. The peripheral neuropathy was predominately sensory in nature, more prone to develop in patients with previous sensory neuropathies and appeared cumulative as well. Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy developed in 9 patients, 6 of which had received prior vincristine. This contributed to the decision to discontinue protocol treatment in 6 cases. It was partially reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. One patient treated at dose level 5 experienced an increase in his pre-existing grade 1 peripheral neuropathy to grade 3 during cycle 1. ',\n"," \"This decreased to baseline with a dose reduction of bortezomib. Two additional patients experienced grade 3 orthostatic hypotension possibly due to drug-induced autonomic neuropathy. Both patients' symptoms resolved with therapy cessation. The overall incidence of grade 3 infection was 6% (5 of 86 cycles). These included 1 oropharyngeal infection, 1 cellulitis, 1 periodontal abscess and 2 episodes of culture negative neutropenic fever. In two instances, patients were removed from the trial following a >5 week period without initiation of the next course of treatment. Other grade 3 toxicites included grade 3 dyspnea potentially related to bortezomib in a patient treated at dose level 5b, grade 3 diarrhea in 2 patients, and one episode each of fatigue, hypoglycemia, and an infusion related rituximab reaction. One patient experienced grade 3 pain related to progressive disease, not believed to be neurologic in etiology. The only grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities included 5 episodes of hyperglycemia, all occurring in a single patient with diabetes mellitus after receiving glucocorticoids as part of her anti-emetic regime. Dose modifications or delays in therapy occurred in 34 of the 86 cycles (40%). Bortezomib was dose reduced in 16 cycles and individual doses were held 26 times for a delivered dose intensity of 88%. In addition, there were a total of 17 weekly delays in therapy. The most common reasons for interruptions in therapy were neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (55% of cases) as well as peripheral neuropathy (32%). Objective responses were observed in 11 patients (Table 5 and 6) for an overall response rate of 45% (95% CI: 0.28 - 0.65) with a clinical benefit rate (complete remissions + partial remissions + stable disease) of 71% (17/24) with 95% CI: 0.51 - 0.86. Two of the 3 patients achieving a complete response have no signs of relapsed disease at 1 and 3 years respectively despite both having been heavily pre-treated including receiving high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Six of the responding patients went on to receive additional therapy. One patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem transplantation and another patient received an umbilical cord blood transplant. Both remain in remission for >5 years. Two patients received additional immunochemotherapy, including fludarabine rituximab and rituximab EPOCH respectively, and 2 patients received further rituximab given in maintenance fashion. Six patients were classified as having stable disease with a median time of 10 months (range 4-30+). \",\n"," 'Of the 12 patients with disease refractory to their most recent regimen, 1 complete response, 4 partial responses, and 3 patients with stable disease (of 4, 5, and 6 months respectively) were observed. Proteasome inhibition affects a variety of cell-signaling pathways via inhibition of proteolysis. Among its pro-apoptotic effects, bortezomib may increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy through the inhibition of DNA repair. Induction of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity, resulting in activation of caspase-3, led to cleavage of the DNA repair enzymes DNA-PKcs and ATM. Further, clinical and laboratory investigations have demonstrated bortezomib to sensitize lymphoma and multiple myeloma cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, reversing drug resistance in some cases. Based on the previously demonstrated efficacy of bortezomib in indolent and mantle cell NHL as well as the potential for bortezomib to inhibit repair of fludarabine-induced DNA strand breaks, we conducted this phase I study in NHL patients with relapsed or refractory disease and determined the MTD to be fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1. The addition of rituximab added significantly to the myelotoxicity of this regimen. Rituximab related neutropenia is a rare complication associated with single agent use and may occur months after administration. Delayed onset neutropenia is also well described when administered is conjunction with chemotherapy and appears to correlate with the intensity of the regimen. In addition, its ability to potentiate the mid-cycle chemotherapy related granulocytopenia has been observed in randomized clinical trials with CHOP and fludarabine based regimens, a finding that did not translate into increased infectious complications. In our study, the patients treated at dose level 5 developed grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in 8 of 11 cycles of therapy. The severe myelosuppression occurred more often and earlier in the treatment course compared to patients treated at the identical doses of fludarabine and bortezomib without rituximab. This potentiation of granulocytopenia may be related more to an undetermined interaction of rituximab with fludarabine than with bortezomib given the similar myelosuppression between dose levels 5a and 5b. However, it is possible that rituximab may have potentiated bortezomib-related thrombocytopenia, a common toxicity of the proteasome inhibitor that has not been otherwise observed with only fludarabine and rituximab. However, further investigation to validate these observations is needed given the small numbers treated at each dose level. ',\n"," 'Hematologic toxicity also appeared related to prior therapy. Patients who had dose intensive treatment or a greater number of prior regimens containing cytotoxic agents appeared to have a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity. This was more pronounced at higher dose levels. As such, this regimen may not be ideal for patients with poor bone marrow reserve, such as those who have undergone previous stem cell transplantation. Neuropathy resulted in 11 dosing adjustments or delays and resulted in a DLT in one patient. All 3 episodes of grade 3 neuropathy occurred at dose levels where 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib was used. While the effects were reversible, this complication is predictable with the combination of fludarabine and bortezomib. Patients with pre-existing peripheral or autonomic neuropathy as well as those with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be monitored closely. However, treatment is feasible as the symptoms typically improve after therapy discontinuation consistent with previous observations. Despite the adverse effects, considerable efficacy was also demonstrated with fludarabine bortezomib and rituximab. Although the primary goal of a phase I study is not to determine efficacy, it is encouraging that 11 of 20 evaluable patients achieved a complete or partial remission. Durable responses were observed at a variety of dose levels and were observed even in the patients who did not receive rituximab, suggesting that bortezomib added significantly to the regimen. This effect was noted despite the previous use of fludarabine in 8 patients and anti-CD20 immunotherapy in 23 patients. Treatment options are limited for patients with chemotherapy or rituximab-refractory disease. Response rates between 61% and 74% have been observed with other salvage strategies including bendamustine and radioimmunoconjugates in treatment refractory patients. Further, response rates with other bortezomib containing chemotherapeutic regimens used to treat patients with relapsed indolent NHL are comparable. In our study, 5 of 12 patients who were refractory to their last treatment regimen attained an objective response. Further, 4 of 11 patients who attained an objective response were treated at dose levels not containing rituximab suggesting notable activity of the fludarabine bortezomib combination. With this encouraging efficacy, further study using this combination in patients with refractory disease is warranted. In conclusion, we found the toxicity of fludarabine, bortezomib and rituximab to be predictable and tolerable with the major DLT being neutropenia. Further, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia resulted in a significant number of treatment interruptions and delays. ',\n"," 'Given the observed myelosuppression, administration of this regimen at 4 week intervals with hematopoietic growth factor support is recommended for further study in the phase II setting. ',\n"," 'Patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) often have chemotherapy resistant disease resulting in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to learn if inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) would produce tumor responses. This was a phase II study of oral single-agent everolimus (10 mg/day) for relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies including CLL. Four of 22 patients with CLL (18%, 95% CI: 5-40%) achieved a partial remission to therapy. An unanticipated finding in this study was an increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients. The ALC increased a median of 4.8 fold (range, 1.9 - 25.1), and the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy decreased a median of 75.5% (range, 38 - 93) compared to baseline measurements. Everolimus has modest anti-tumor activity against CLL and can mobilize malignant cells from nodal masses into the peripheral circulation in a subset of CLL patients. Because CLL cells in lymphatic tissue and bone marrow can be more resistant to therapy than circulating CLL cells, the ability of everolimus to mobilize CLL cells into the circulation could be utilized in combination therapeutic regimens. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the US with an estimated incidence of 20,000 new diagnoses per year and a prevalence of over 100,000. There is now highly effective initial therapy for previously untreated, advanced stage CLL with response rates of over 90%, complete responses (CR) in more than 40% of patients, and median response durations in excess of 3 years. In contrast, outcome remains poor for patients with relapsed or treatment-refractory CLL. More effective therapies for this group of patients are needed. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is a multifunctional signal transduction kinase with a critical role in the signal transduction pathway linking growth stimuli with cell cycle progression. Rapamycin can inhibit cell growth and proliferation, induce apoptosis in some tumor cell lines, and inhibit tumor cell motility by impairing cell polarization and protrusion. Rapamycin has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro although the required concentration was higher than is achievable in vivo and the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain. There are now two rapamycin analogs, temsirolimus and everolimus, which are currently approved by the US FDA for relapsed renal cancer. ',\n"," 'Temsirolimus also has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Although a major pathogenic mechanism in development of CLL is defective apoptosis, recent research has shown that CLL is a dynamic malignancy with cellular turnover ranging between 0.1 and 1% per day. The CLL tumor burden has two distinct cellular populations, a proliferative compartment morphologically characterized by larger cells in the proliferation centers of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, and the kinetically inactive circulating cells. A targeted inhibitor of cell division such as everolimus could be effective in the treatment of CLL, especially in patients with relapsed/refractory disease who often have more rapid cellular turnover. This hypothesis is supported by data from in vitro studies that showed that rapamycin and everolimus induce cell cycle arrest in activated CLL cells without inducing apoptosis. In addition, proliferation of CLL cells requires stromal support mediated through cytokines and adhesion molecules (e.g. integrins) and many of these supportive signals are transmitted by the PI3K and Akt pathways involving mTOR. Thus, there is a sound biological rationale for testing everolimus as a treatment for CLL. We have recently completed a phase II clinical trial using everolimus to treat patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies that included 22 patients with CLL. In this paper we report the results of treatment of the CLL patients. The most striking finding was the increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and concomitant decrease in the lymph node size observed in 8 of these patients. This was a two-stage, phase II study conducted to assess response in previously treated patients with lymphoid malignancies after treatment with single-agent everolimus. The study was conducted through the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients with CLL were eligible for this trial if they met the CLL diagnostic criteria defined by the National Cancer Institute-Working Group Criteria of 1996 (NCI-WG 1996) or the criteria for the small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) variant defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), had previously received therapy for their lymphoid malignancy, and had relapsed or were refractory to their last treatment. The relapse was required to be biopsy proven within 6 months prior to enrollment. There was no limit on the number of prior therapies. ',\n"," 'prior therapies. Patients were required to be >=18 years old, and in addition to meeting diagnostic criteria, were also required to have pre-treatment measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with at least one lesion that had a single diameter of >2 cm, or an ALC >5 x109/L. Patients were to have a life expectancy of >= 3 months; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1 x 109/L; platelet count >= 75 x 109/L; hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL; serum creatinine <= 2x the upper limit of normal (UNL); serum bilirubin <= 2 UNL (if total bilirubin >2 then a direct bilirubin of <1.5 UNL was acceptable); AST <= 3 x ULN (<= 5 x ULN if liver involvement was present). Patients could not have known HIV infection. Patients were treated with 10 mg of everolimus by mouth in the fasting state every day and 4 weeks of treatment was considered one cycle. A complete blood count was performed weekly during the first cycle and then before each subsequent cycle. If the platelet count was >=40 x 109/L, the ANC >=1 x 109/L, and there were no grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0), the full dose of everolimus was prescribed for the next cycle. Patients who did not meet the retreatment criteria had treatment held until recovery followed by a stepwise dose modification to 5 mg daily, 5 mg every other day, and 5 mg every third day. Patients did not receive prophylactic white blood cell growth factors to maintain dosing but could receive them at physician discretion if neutropenia developed. Erythropoietin treatment for anemia was also permitted at physician discretion. Patients were restaged for tumor response after 2 and 6 cycles using the NCI-WG 1996 criteria for those with an ALC > 5 x 109/L and the International Workshop Criteria for patients who had never had an ALC > 5 x 109/L (SLL variant). The maximum decrease in the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy was determined from the sum of the products of the largest lymph nodes diameters on clinical examination of the largest cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes. Patients who had disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at any time went off study. ',\n"," 'Patients with stable disease after 6 cycles continued treatment at their physician\\'s discretion.\"] Patients who had a complete remission (CR) after cycle 6 were to receive 2 cycles past CR and then could discontinue everolimus and be observed or could continue on therapy at their physician\\'s discretion.\"] Patients with a partial remission (PR) after 6 cycles of therapy continued on treatment until progression if tolerated. This phase II study used a two-stage Simon design to assess the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies. Thirty-seven evaluable patients were required to test the null hypothesis that the true response rate for this regimen is at most 20% versus the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is 40% or greater. The study had 90% power, with a 9% type I error rate. A patient was considered evaluable for response if they were eligible and received treatment. The response rate was estimated by the number of responses divided by the number of evaluable patients. A 95% binomial confidence interval for the true response rate was calculated. This report is limited to the 22 CLL patients enrolled on the study because of the unique characteristics of the response of these patients to treatment with everolimus. Duration of response (DR) was defined for patients who achieved a response as the time from the date a response was first documented until the earliest date progression was documented. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined for all patients as the time from the date of registration until the date of progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of registration until the date of death due to any cause. The distributions of time to event endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and patients who were event-free were censored on the date of last follow-up. Adverse events were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Toxicity was defined as an adverse event classified as being possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Twenty two patients with CLL (10 with the SLL variant) were enrolled on this study between January 2006 and July 2008 (Table 1). All patients were eligible and evaluable for response. The median time from diagnosis of CLL to registration was 7 years (range, 2 - 22 years). ',\n"," 'Four patients (18%, 95% CI: 5-40%) achieved a PR to therapy at 1.8, 6.4, 9.1, and 14.1 months of treatment and maintained a response for 2.2, 11.0, 19.8, and 8.9+ months, respectively. Seventeen patients had disease progression, and 15 patients have died. Causes of death included disease progression (n = 11), infection possibly attributable to treatment as detailed below (n = 2), infection unrelated to treatment (n=1), and was unknown in 1 patient. The median follow-up for patients still alive was 17 months (range, 6 - 30), the median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 4.9 - 20.7) and the median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI: 2.3 - 8.3). An unanticipated and potentially important finding of this study was the increase in the ALC associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients (Figure 1). This lymphocyte mobilization was observed in 6 (66%) of the 9 patients with an ALC > 5 x 109/L at baseline and 2 (15%) of the 13 patients with an ALC <= 5 x 109/L at baseline. Among the 8 patients in whom this phenomenon was observed, all had measurable lymphadenopathy at baseline and in 6 (75%) at least one node was >= 5 cm in diameter. The ALC increased from a median baseline level of 7.1 x 109/L (range, 0.7 - 101.2) to 18.3 x 109/L (range, 1.2 - 415.3) at the first post-treatment ALC (median interval from start of therapy 29 days, range, 7 - 49)(Figure 2). Patients achieved a median of 76% (range, 38 - 93) decrease in clinically measurable node size compared to baseline. This was associated with a median 4.8 fold (range, 1.9 - 25.1) increase in the ALC compared to baseline (median, 38.4 x 109/L; range, 3.8 - 415.3) which occurred at a median interval of 43 days (range, 29 - 242) from the start of therapy. Of the 8 patients with lymphocyte mobilization, 2 achieved a clinical PR (both had SLL), 4 had clinically stable disease, 1 had disease progression, and 1 was removed from the study because of an adverse event before clinical response could be evaluated. Lymphocyte mobilization was not an anticipated finding in this study and the mechanism of this response was not studied. ',\n"," 'In one patient with lymphocyte mobilization a bone marrow (BM) examination was performed on day 6 of everolimus treatment due to concern about the patient\\'s clinical status.\"] Although the results of the BM biopsy showed minimal change compared to baseline, the majority of the BM and circulating lymphocytes had the same morphological appearance of CLL cells. This finding suggests that the increase in circulating lymphocytes was caused by an increase in CLL cells. No confirmatory immunophenotyping studies were done on the circulating lymphocytes. Patients received a median of 2 months (range, 1 week - 29 months) and a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-18) of treatment. Twenty patients have gone off treatment, 13 due to disease progression, 3 due to toxicity (1 patient with grade 2 pancreatitis, 1 patient with grade 3 fatigue, 1 cytopenia), 2 died on-study (1 patient due to sepsis possibly related to treatment, 1 patient died from disease progression), and 2 patients refused further therapy without response or progression. Nine patients experienced dose delays on 12 cycles of therapy due to hematological adverse events (10 cycles), hospitalization (1 cycle), and a delay in getting laboratory results (1 cycle). Nine patients experienced dose reductions on 11 cycles due to hematological adverse events (9 cycles), mucositis (1 cycle), and infection (1 cycle). Fifteen patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse event (7 grade 3, 8 grade 4) and 9 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse event (5 grade 3, 1 grade 4, 3 grade 5). Focusing on adverse events at least possibly attributable to the study therapy (Table 2), 14 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity (6 grade 3, 8 grade 4) and 7 patients experienced a grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (5 grade 3, 2 grade 5). Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 23%, 32%, and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities were pneumonia (n = 2) and hypertriglyceridemia (n = 2). One patient, who died of infection with positive blood cultures, had grade 4 adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicating sepsis and grade 3 neutropenia, both complications were considered to be probably related to treatment. Another patient with grade 2 neutropenia died of sepsis possibly related to treatment. Treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL using single agent everolimus showed biological activity with 18% of patients achieving a PR. ',\n"," 'An additional finding was that 36% of patients had an unexpected and marked increase in the ALC with a concomitant decease in lymph node size. These results show that everolimus can be clinically active in some patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, and suggest that mTOR inhibition can mobilize CLL cells from tissue sites into the circulation. Both of these findings could have important implications for the treatment of CLL. Patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, especially those with purine analogue refractory disease or loss of p53 function because of gene deletions or mutations, have a poor prognosis. The 18% PR rate achieved with everolimus therapy in this study, although modest, warrants further study in light of the heavily pretreated nature of the patient population, the fact that this study used single agent everolimus, and that tumor cell mobilization was observed. In addition, the modest response rate needs to be interpreted in the context of the NCI-WG 1996 criteria that requires a minimum 50% decrease in the ALC to qualify for a response to treatment. The increase in ALC observed in 6 of the patients with CLL who had a decrease in adenopathy, prevents them from being considered responsive to treatment. This could have resulted in an underestimation of the efficacy of single agent everolimus therapy in this group of patients. The mobilization effect observed could be especially useful for selecting drugs to be tested in combination with everolimus. In the only previously published report of the treatment of patients with CLL using everolimus, the pilot trial was stopped after treatment of only 7 patients because of infectious complications. Of the treated patients, one achieved a PR and 3 had stable disease. Although not commented on by the authors, review of the published data shows that 6 of the 7 patients appear to have had progressive lymphocytosis in response to initiation of therapy with everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/day; there was no information on the effect of everolimus on lymphadenopathy. The stromal microenvironment of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow provides critical support for CLL cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to therapeutic drugs. Pre-clinical data suggests that disruption of the interaction between CLL cells and stroma can decrease drug resistance in CLL cells. In addition, the therapeutic unconjugated monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab and rituximab, which are highly effective against circulating CLL cells, have limited efficacy against bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly. ',\n"," 'Mobilization of CLL cells from tissue into the circulation is likely to remove these CLL cells from the protective stromal microenvironment and enhance the cytotoxicity of drugs such as alemtuzumab which have the additional advantage of being effective in patients with purine analogue refractory CLL with defective p53 function. Combinations of everolimus and drugs such as alemtuzumab could potentially be synergistic in patients with bulky adenopathy resulting in improved treatment outcomes. Everolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that can also be myelosuppressive. Thus, it was not surprising that infections were observed in this study of CLL patients already immunocompromised by their underlying disease and prior therapy. Indeed, infection resulted in 2 deaths. Neutropenia could have contributed to the risk of infection, but thrombocytopenia was not associated with bleeding complications. The other grade 3-4 toxicities responded well to appropriate management. These data suggest that CLL patients treated with everolimus in the future will likely benefit from prophylaxis and surveillance for opportunistic infections, and that combination therapies including everolimus should be designed to minimize marrow toxicity in this patient population. The mTOR has been shown to be an integral component of important signaling pathways in CLL cells, and inhibition of these pathways by everolimus could be expected to decrease cell growth and be cytotoxic. In contrast, the mechanism by which everolimus causes CLL cell mobilization into the circulation is unknown and will need to be investigated in order to develop interventions to optimize this effect. These investigations were not performed in this study because the finding was unexpected. The extent of mobilization and the concomitant decrease in the clinically detectable lymphadenopathy was only fully appreciated at the time of analysis of the study results. The study was designed to evaluate ALC each cycle and measurable lymph nodes after cycles two and six and every three cycles thereafter. The study was not designed to measure or record ALC more frequently; therefore, the kinetics and magnitude of the CLL cell mobilization could actually have been underestimated in this study population. Future studies should be designed to more frequently measure the mobilization effect of everolimus in CLL patients, study the cell surface immunophenotype of the mobilized cells, and determine if the CLL cells mobilized into the circulation are as sensitive to monoclonal antibody mediated cytotoxicity as cells collected prior to treatment with everolimus. ',\n"," 'In conclusion, this study shows that everolimus could be a valuable drug for use in combination therapy for CLL patients. ',\n"," 'INNO-406, an oral dual Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), demonstrates specific Lyn kinase activity with no or limited activity against other Src-family member kinases. Several Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including the F317L and F317V mutations. In this study, we evaluated INNO-406 in Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) post-imatinib resistance or intolerance. A dose escalation study was conducted with a starting dose of 30mg administered orally once daily. Cohorts of at least 3 patients were treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Twice-daily (BID) dosing was also evaluated. Therapy was allowed for a maximum of 24 months. INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with imatinib resistance (n=40) or intolerance (n=16). Other previous treatments included nilotinib (n=20), dasatinib (n=26), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n=9). Common mutations upon study entry included Y253H (n=6), G250E (n=4), T315I (n=4) and F317L (n=3). Among 31 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with INNO-406, the major cytogenetic response rate was 19%. In this study, no responses were seen in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at INNO-406 480mg BID were liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. INNO-406 showed anti-CML efficacy in this heavily pretreated study population. Based on the classical determinations of both DLT and MTD, the recommended phase 2 dose of INNO-406 is 240mg orally BID. Lower doses of INNO-406 may be equally effective and should be explored. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which >=95% of patients display a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome abnormality yields a fusion gene encoding a constitutively active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase that is considered essential for the pathophysiology of CML. In the United States, about 5000 people are diagnosed with CML each year. Historically, the 5-year survival rate for patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) was approximately 40%. Since the introduction in 2001 of the first specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib mesylate, the estimated 5 to 7-year survival rates for newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have increased to over 90%. As patients with CML live longer, prevalence of the disease is expected to increase over the coming years. The success of imatinib demonstrates that specific inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase has clinical benefits in the treatment of CML. ',\n"," 'However, based on the findings of a 5-year follow up assessment, imatinib resistance occurs at a rate of approximately 4% per year. Resistance is believed to be due to 3 main mechanisms: (1) increased expression of Bcr-Abl; (2) Bcr-Abl mutations; and (3) the development of Bcr-Abl-independent resistance pathways, such as Lyn kinase activation. In patients with Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or those with CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP) or blastic phase (CML-BP), imatinib treatment often fails to achieve high rates of complete cytogenetic response; these patients frequently develop resistance to therapy and relapse. In 20% to 55% of such patients, treatment resistance can be attributed to the emergence of clones with mutant forms of Bcr-Abl, which exhibit a decreased sensitivity to imatinib. More than 60 mutant forms of Bcr-Abl have been detected, the most common of which are E255K, T315I, and M351T. Mutants have varying degrees of imatinib resistance, and thus more potent Bcr-Abl inhibitors or dual Abl/Lyn inhibitors may improve treatment results. INNO-406, a dual Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may be an effective treatment for certain leukemias (Ph-positive CML and ALL). INNO-406, was developed to overcome imatinib resistance. Unlike other second-generation TKIs, INNO-406 demonstrates specific Lyn kinase activity with no or limited activity against other Src-family member kinases. Numerous Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including the F317L and F317V mutations. INNO-406 is 25 to 55 times more potent than imatinib against Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cell lines K562 and KU812 and against BaF3 cells overexpressing unmutated Bcr-Abl (BaF3/um). Autophosphorylation of unmutated Bcr-Abl is also more potently inhibited by INNO-406 than by imatinib. In vivo, INNO-406 is at least 10 times more potent than imatinib. Chemically, INNO-406 is a 2-phenlaminopyrimidine with structural resemblance to both imatinib and nilotinib. The molecular structure of INNO-406 is shown in Figure 1. This phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized dose-escalation study was conducted at 6 international sites from July 17, 2006, to November 28, 2007, to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical activity of INNO-406 administered orally daily in adult patients with Ph-positive CML or ALL post-imatinib resistance or intolerance. Patients with Ph-positive leukemias, including CML-CP, CML-AP, CML-BP, and Ph-positive ALL), and imatinib resistance or intolerance were included in the trial. The definitions of imatinib resistance and intolerance were as previously described. ',\n"," 'greater than or equal to 15,000 cells/mm3, documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 2 week) or cytogenetic (greater than 35% of Ph-positive cells in the bone marrow after at least 1 year of therapy, or an absolute rise in the percentage of Ph-positive cells of 30% over best response). Imatinib intolerance was defined as the presence of any toxicity that prevented patients from receiving therapy (according to the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 [CTCAE v3.0] grade 3 or 4 toxicity or persistent grade 2 toxicity). Patients with resistance or intolerance to other second-line TKIs, such as dasatinib or nilotinib, were also included. Definitions of CML phases were as previously reported. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be 18 years of age or older, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2, and have normal cardiac, hepatic, and renal functions. Females enrolled in the study could not be pregnant or lactating. Patients were not allowed to have received chemotherapy within 1 week or imatinib within 3 days before the start of the trial. Exceptions included hydroxyurea administration, as clinically indicated before and during the first 21 days of treatment, and corticosteroids up to 48 hours before the first study dose. Patients with comorbid states, such as opportunistic and/or uncontrolled systemic infections, impaired gastrointestinal function, psychiatric disorders, and/or sustained toxicity from prior therapies, were excluded from the study, as were those with a history of another primary malignancy of clinical significance requiring intervention. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at each study site. Patients were required to provide written informed consent. The primary objective of this phase 1 study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of INNO-406. Secondary objectives included evaluation of response, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The starting dose of INNO-406 was 30 mg administered orally once daily (QD), equaling 10% of the 30 mg/kg dose level used in a previous 4-week rat toxicity study, at which no deaths occurred (data on file). In the absence of a CTCAE v3.0 grade 2 or higher drug-related toxicity, the dose of INNO-406 was escalated by 100% in cohorts of at least 3 patients. If grade 2 drug-related toxicity occurred, INNO-406 dose was increased by 50% until the MTD was reached. ',\n"," 'The INNO-406 doses evaluated were: 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 mg QD, and then 120, 240, and 480 mg administered orally twice daily (BID). Because all of the patients in the 480 mg BID cohort experienced toxicities, a BID cohort between the 240 mg and 480 mg BID cohorts was evaluated; this intermediate cohort received 360 mg BID. Once the MTD was determined, up to 20 patients in each of the 3 CML phases and up to 20 patients with Ph-positive ALL were treated at that dose. Intrapatient dose escalation of INNO-406 was permitted in patients who had a suboptimal response to INNO-406 therapy only after the next dose level had been documented to be safe. A suboptimal response was defined as a failure to achieve either a hematologic response after 1 month or a major cytogenetic response after 6 months of therapy. This is based on observations that failure to achieve early hematologic response or major cytogenetic response after 6-12 months are associated with worse outcome. At each step, the investigators evaluated the relevant risks and benefits of continued study participation for each patient. No more than 2 dose reductions were allowed before the patient was withdrawn from the study, unless this was considered in the patient\\'s best interest.\"] Patients were removed from therapy or further assessment upon disease progression, physician decision that a change in therapy was in the patient\\'s best interest, or by patient\\'s request.\"] Other reasons for removal of patients from the study were continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal dose reduction, noncompliance, and pregnancy. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v3.0 criteria. Disease response was assessed at specified intervals by disease-specific response criteria. Response criteria were as previously described. A complete hematologic response (CHR) was defined as normal white blood cell count (WBC) with normal differential and platelet counts <450x109/L, and no signs or symptoms of leukemia, including no splenomegaly. Cytogenetic response was defined as complete (0% Ph-positive), partial (1-35% Ph-positive), and minor (36-95% Ph-positive). A major cytogenetic response included complete and partial cytogenetic responses (i.e., <= 35% Ph-positive). The incidence, severity, duration, causality, seriousness, and type of adverse events, physical examination changes, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results were recorded and tabulated. Standard pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined, together with the coefficient of variation of INNO-406 concentrations, to guide decision-making with regard to dosing level and frequency. ',\n"," 'Patients were evaluated for both complete and partial hematologic and cytogenetic responses. Mutational analyses were performed as previously detailed. INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with Ph-positive CML or ALL and resistance to (n = 40 [71%]) or intolerance of (n = 16 [29%]) imatinib (Table 1). Twenty-seven patients (48%) were females. In addition to imatinib, most of the patients had been treated previously with other TKIs, including dasatinib (n = 26), nilotinib (n = 20), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n = 9). Forty-six patients had failed at least two TKIs (imatinib and dasatinib or nilotinib); nine of the 46 patients had failed all three TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib); 10 of the 56 patients failed only imatinib. Fourteen patients (25%) were resistant to and 12 (21%) were intolerant of dasatinib. Seventeen (30%) patients were nilotinib resistant and 3 (5%) patients were nilotinib intolerant. The median duration of CML was 84 months (range, 43 to 267 months). Median durations of INNO-406 treatment were 3.7 months (range, 1 to 12 months) for the overall study group and 4.4 months (range, 1 to 12 months) for the subgroup with CML-CP. All 17 patients enrolled at 240 mg BID after determination of the MTD had CML-CP. INNO-406 was well tolerated, and QD dosing cohorts of 30 to 480 mg QD were treated without the development of DLTs. After pharmacokinetic analyses suggested that BID dosing might be beneficial, BID dosing cohorts were initiated, beginning with 120 mg BID. At a dose level of 480 mg BID, DLTs, including elevations of transaminases and thrombocytopenia, were observed. Transaminase elevations were still noted at an INNO-406 dose of 360 mg BID; these included grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in 4 patients and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations in 2 patients. Seventeen patients were then enrolled at 240 mg BID as part of a protocol-specified expansion cohort, which was limited to patients with CML-CP. In the 17 patients treated with 240 mg BID, transaminase elevations were still observed but were less severe. No patients had drug-related grade 3 AST elevations and only 1 patient had a drug-related grade 3 ALT elevation. Drug related grade 2 ALT elevations occurred at the 240 mg BID dose level in 9 patients, and a grade 2 AST elevation developed in 1 patient. ',\n"," 'The elevated transaminase levels observed at 240 mg BID resolved when INNO-406 dosing was withheld temporarily and then resumed at a lower dose. Based on these results, an INNO-406 dose of 240 mg BID is proposed for phase 2 studies. In addition to elevated transaminases, the other most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse event noted was thrombocytopenia (Table 2). When both drug- and non-drug-related thrombocytopenic events were considered, 2 and 3 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia, respectively, including 1 patient who initiated INNO-406 treatment with preexisting grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts recovered when INNO-406 was withheld and then resumed at a lower dose. This study incorporated a planned central evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the first cycle of therapy to assess for QT prolongation. During this period of intense monitoring, the QTcB increased to grade 2 in 4 patients and the QTcF increased to grade 2 in 1 patient. Only 1 patient, who entered the study with a waiver due to a prolonged QTc, developed a QTc >500 msec during this routine monitoring after cycle 1. The patient experienced no further events after discontinuing INNO-406. The NCI categories of adverse events that were experienced by >=10% of patients were metabolic/laboratory (73.2%), gastrointestinal (64.3%), pain (58.9%), constitutional symptoms (48.2%), infection (33.9%), dermatology/skin (28.6%), blood/bone marrow (25.0%), lymphatics (25.0%), neurology (23.2%), pulmonary/upper respiratory (17.9%), cardiac general (12.5%), hemorrhage/bleeding (10.7%), and musculoskeletal/soft tissue (10.7%). Five patients have died since beginning treatment; all deaths were related to leukemia progression. Four deaths were among 16 patients in CML blastic phase or Ph-positive ALL; 1 death was among 8 patients in CML accelerated phase; no deaths so far have been recorded among 31 patients in chronic phase. The 5 deaths did not appear to be correlated to dosing regimen: 1 at 30 mg daily, 2 at 120 mg daily, 1 at 480 mg BID, 1 at 360 mg BID. No cases of pleural or pericardial effusions were noted. Table 3 provides a detailed summary of cytogenetic responses. All of the patients who achieved a cytogenetic response had CML-CP. No responses were observed in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with CML-CP. Three patients had a complete cytogenetic response, one at each of the INNO-406 dose schedules of 120 mg QD, 120 mg BID, and 240 mg BID. ',\n"," 'The remaining 3 patients had a partial cytogenetic response: 2 patients at 240 mg BID and 1 patient at 480 mg BID. None of the six major cytogenetic responders had baseline cytogenetic clonal evolution. Thus, 4 of the major cytogenetic responses occurred in patients treated with INNO-406 doses of 240 mg BID or greater. This represents a major cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled, and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CML-CP. For the patients with major cytogenetic responses, the pretreatment regimens and the associated reasons for changes in therapy are listed in Table 4, which also provides the mutation status at baseline (eg, prior to INNO-406 exposure). Two additional patients achieved a minimal cytogenetic response. Complete and partial hematologic responses were observed in 3 patients. Illustrative of the pharmacokinetic data seen in the full analyses, the pharmacokinetic parameters of INNO-406 in the 240 mg BID cohort are presented here. This cohort was selected based on clinical safety and efficacy evaluations that took events at the higher doses into consideration. As illustrated in Figure 2, accumulation of INNO-406 was observed on day 15 for both the 360 and 480 mg BID cohorts. For the 240 mg BID cohort, the mean time to achieve peak concentration (Cmax = 487 ng/mL) was 1.3 hours (standard deviation [SD] = 0.5). Pharmacokinetic analyses performed in the entire study population also demonstrated an increase in Cmax with increasing INNO-406 doses for both QD and BID dosing. The half-life was relatively short; mean (SD) half-lives for BID dosing on day 1 and day 15 were 1.99 hours (0.817) and 2.28 hours (0.751), respectively. For BID dosing, the mean (SD) accumulation factor was 2.73 (4.96). The maximum concentration and area under the curve (Cmax and AUC) were dose proportional; however, dose proportionality for AUC was not demonstrable with BID dosing. Mutational analysis performed at the central laboratories revealed mutations in 22 of 49 patients (45%) analyzed. Common mutations included Y253H in 6 patients, G250E in 4 patients, T315I in 4 patients, and F317L in 3 patients. This phase 1 study of INNO-406, a novel, potent dual BCR-AbL/Lyn TKI, evaluated dose levels ranging from once-daily doses of 30 to 480 mg and from BID doses of 120 to 480 mg. The DLTs observed included liver dysfunction and myelosuppression. ',\n"," 'The proposed INNO 406 dose scheduled for phase 2 study is 240 mg orally BID, and this value is based on the classical determinations of DLT and MTD from phase I studies. Lower dose schedules of INNO-406 may be as effective and should be explored. In this heavily pretreated study group of 56 patients, INNO-406 therapy resulted in 6 major cytogenetic responses (3 complete and 3 partial), all in 31 patients treated for CML-CP, for a major cytogenetic response rate of 19%. Of the 56 patients treated in this study, 71% were resistant to and 29% were intolerant of imatinib. In addition, 26 patients experienced resistance to or intolerance of dasatinib, and 20 patients, resistance to or intolerance of nilotinib. In the majority of patients, therefore, prior treatment with multiple Bcr-Abl TKIs had failed. As many of the patients in this study were being treated in the third-line setting, a lower response rate would be expected than seen in the second-line setting represented by the dasatinib and nilotinib studies. In this study, no responses were seen in patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with CML-CP. Four of the responses occurred in patients in the cohort that received a starting INNO-406 dose of 240 mg BID or greater. This represents a major cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CML-CP. Major cytogenetic responses have been reported in 40% to 45% of patients with CML-CP treated in the second-line setting with dasatinib or nilotinib. It is unclear what response would be expected with dasatinib or nilotinib in a study population that included both second- and third-line setting patients. Myelosuppression and pleural effusions are serious adverse events that have been seen with dasatinib, and myelosuppression and liver dysfunction, with nilotinib., 25 These events were observed infrequently with INNO-406. The safety profile of INNO-406 is therefore unique, offering a potential advantage in the treatment of patients who have developed toxicities during treatment with other Bcr-Abl TKIs. Of note, a planned central evaluation of ECGs during the first cycle of INNO-406 therapy revealed only 1 patient with a QTc >500 msec; this patient, who had an elevated QTc at baseline, entered the study with a waiver. ',\n"," 'Mutational analysis revealed mutations prior to the start of INNO-406 in 22 of the 49 patients analyzed (45%). Among these were 4 patients who had T315I mutations, which are known to confer resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. None of the 4 patients with T315I mutations responded to INNO-406. Outcomes of CML treatment have improved dramatically since the introduction of imatinib mesylate. The rising incidence of imatinib resistance and intolerance has resulted in the need for alternative agents. Nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are second-generation TKIs that have been developed to overcome imatinib resistance. All 3 agents have similar efficacy with slightly different adverse effect profiles. There is a need for additional agents that are more potent than both imatinib and the existing second-generation TKIs. As patients are being treated longer, they are more commonly cycling through different treatment regimens. This study demonstrates that INNO-406 is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg BID. Lower dose schedules may also be equally effective and deserve further evaluation. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of INNO-406 in patients who have developed resistance to or intolerance of imatinib and/or other TKIs. INNO-406, an oral dual Abl/Lyn kinase inhibitor, is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg BID in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. ',\n"," 'Fludarabine, is one of the most active single agents in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Over time, however, virtually all CLL patients become fludarabine-refractory. To elucidate whether microRNAs are involved in the development of fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the expression of 723 human miRNAs before and 5-days after fludarabine mono-therapy in 17 CLL patients which were classified as responder or refractory to fludarabine treatment based on NCI criteria. By comparing the expression profiles of these two groups of patients, we identified a microRNA signature able to distinguish refractory from sensitive CLLs. The expression of some microRNAs was also able to predict fludarabine resistance of 12 independent CLL patients. Among the identified microRNAs, miR-148a, miR-222 and miR-21 exhibited a significantly higher expression in non-responder patients either before and after fludarabine treatment. After performing messenger RNA expression profile of the same patients, the activation of p53-responsive genes was detected in fludarabine responsive cases only, therefore suggesting a possible mechanism linked to microRNA deregulation in non-responder patients. Importantly, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides induced a significant increase in caspase activity in fludarabine-treated p53-mutant MEG-01 cells, suggesting that miR-21 and miR-222 up-regulation may be involved in the establishment of fludarabine resistance. This is the first report that reveals the existence of a microRNA profile that differentiate refractory and sensitive CLLs, either before and after fludarabine mono-therapy. A p53 dysfunctional pathway emerged in refractory CLLs and could contribute in explaining the observed miRNA profile. Moreover, this work indicates that specific microRNAs can be used to predict fludarabine resistance and may potentially be used as therapeutic targets, therefore establishing an important starting point for future studies. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common hematologic neoplasia in the Western world and is characterized by a clonal expansion of CD5+ B-cells. The disease may have a long and indolent course, not requiring treatment for years, or it may rapidly progress. Initially most patients respond to purine nucleoside analogs, which today represent pivotal agents for first and second-line treatment. However a significant fraction of patients do not respond or become resistant to fludarabine in the years and prognosis for this group of patients is poor. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. It has been reported that p53 dysfunction, deriving from 17p13 deletion, predicts non-response to fludarabine therapy and poor prognosis. ',\n"," 'Other genetic factors associated with poor prognosis, such as del(11q22.3) and immunoglobulin (Ig) V(H) unmutated status, have been also associated with shorter progression-free survival after chemotherapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes, through their wide action as post-transcriptional gene expression modulators. In CLL, miR-15/16 were shown to be located within 13q14 deletion; they were shown to act as tumor suppressor genes, possibly through the modulation of BCL2 and various other target genes. A germline mutation affecting miRNA maturation was detected in few cases of familial CLL as well as in the New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse strain, a mice developing a B lymphoproliferative disease that is a model for human CLL. A set of miRNAs was able to distinguish CLLs from normal CD5+ B-cells and 13 miRNAs associated to CLL prognostic groups were identified through the identification of the molecular profiles of CLLs with IgVH mutated or unmutated status combined with ZAP70 levels. Likewise, miR-29c and miR-223 have been used to create a quantitative PCR-based score able to improve CLL patients stratification in terms of treatment free survival and overall survival, when combined with two other prognostic factors. Recently, Zenz and colleagues found that fludarabine-refractory CLLs were characterized more frequently (53%) by lower levels of miR-34a than sensitive CLLs (9%). MiR-34a has been implicated in CLL response to DNA damage through a p53-mediated induction, while miR-106b has been linked to Itch inhibition, and consequent p73 activation, in deacetylase inhibitors treated CLLs. Fludarabine is an active agent in CLL and, it is frequently used nowadays in combination regimens in first and second line treatment, especially in younger and fit patients. Fludarabine as single agent produces better response rates than chlorambucil and represents a reasonable choice as single agent in frail or elderly patients. Because specific miRNAs may be involved in patients response to fludarabine treatment and in the development of fludarabine resistance, we designed this study aimed at identifying the miRNA expression profile associated with the response to fludarabine, used as a single agent, in the treatment of patients with CLL. To investigate the possible involvement of miRNAs in fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the miRNA expression profile of 17 CLL patients, before and after 5 days of treatment with fludarabine as single agent. ',\n"," 'NCI criteria, 9 of the patients exhibited a clinical response (CR), i.e. they attained either complete or partial response, while 8 patients were resistant to the treatment and were classified as non responders (NR). Characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table 1. An additional blind cohort of 12 patients was recruited among patients who were treated with fludarabine (Table 1), to test the efficacy of specific miRNAs as response predictors. We evaluated the miRNAs expression in 33 samples obtained from CLL patients before and after treatment, hereafter called pre and post, through the hybridization on a miRNA platform (Agilent technologies) able to assess the expression levels of 723 human miRNAs (MiRBASE release 10.1). First, we identified the miRNAs induced or repressed by fludarabine treatment by comparing post CLLs to the pre-treatment samples (fold change >1.5 and p-value < 0.05). We compared pre and post samples in the entire groups or in the NR and CR sub-groups separately, which revealed 97, 67 and 60 differentially expressed miRNAs, respectively. Among these, using Venn Diagram intersection, we identified 37 miRNAs that were differentially expressed either in the CR cohort and in the NR cohort of samples (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). A hierarchical clustering algorithm, performed using the list of 37 miRNAs, correctly classified the pre versus post fludarabine samples (Figure 1). The complete list of miRNAs that were identified as differentially expressed either in the CR cohort or in the NR cohort of samples or both can be found in Additional file 2: Table S2. The post versus pre treatment analysis revealed that 37 miRNAs were similarly modulated by fludarabine in both NR and CR patients. This set of miRNAs indicated common mechanisms modulated by fludarabine, but could not reveal mechanisms underlying resistance to treatment. However, many additional miRNAs exhibited a different modulation in CRs versus NRs, which could be used to derive a miRNA signature associated with fludarabine resistance. To investigate this hypothesis, we searched for miRNAs whose expression was significantly different between these two cohorts of CLL patients. Analyses of pre and post treatment samples were performed separately. The lists of differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained by statistical analysis of microarray data (Table 2 and 3). ',\n"," 'The comparison of CR and NR patients led to the identification of 10 differentially expressed miRNAs in the pre-treatment setting (p < 0.05), listed in Table 2. This set of miRNAs was used to classify the patients by a clusterization algorithm. Eighty-two percent of patients were correctly classified by a cluster analysis (all but three: CLL 11, 18 and 22) (Figure 2A). The comparison of CRs and NRs in the post-treatment setting led to the identification of 11 miRNAs differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive patients (p < 0.05) (Table 3). Cluster analysis of these miRNAs was able to correctly classify 88% samples (all but two: CLL 4 and 22) (Figure 2B). We validated the microarray results for miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) on the same group of 16 post samples, adding also 3 new samples. We chose these miRNAs considering the extent of their modulation and because they are differentially expressed both before and after the treatment. The expression level of every miRNA in every post CLL was assayed in triplicate and normalized on U6 RNA expression levels. Microarray results were confirmed by RT-qPCR in every group of CLLs (Additional file 3: Figure S1). To verify whether the three validated miRNAs (miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222) might be able to predict the efficacy of fludarabine treatment and might therefore become useful in directing patients therapy, we collected a new cohort of 12 patients (test set). These patients were treated by fludarabine as single agent because of disease progression. Samples were collected immediately before the treatment and the miRNA expression was assayed by RT-qPCR. In this new cohort, results were even more clear than in the microarray training set of samples (Figure 3A). Patients classified as NRs displayed a significantly (p < 0.05 at two-tailed t-test) increased expression of miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222 if compared to patients sensitive to treatment. Interestingly, we were also able to predict the response to treatment of newly diagnosed patients by using a score based on the combination of miR-21, 148a and 222 expression levels. Using this score based on quantitative expression of 3 miRNAs, prediction was 100% accurate (Figure 3B). To better elucidate the molecular context responsible for the differential expression of miRNAs in NR versus CR patients, we performed a mRNA expression profile on a subgroup of the samples. ',\n"," 'Experiments data were obtained for pre and post fludarabine treatment of 14 patients (the same employed for miRNA analysis, except CLL-04, CLL-09 and CLL-16A, whose RNA was not available), 7 of them were CRs and 7 NRs. We hybridized the samples on a human mRNA platform (Agilent Technologies) able to assess the expression levels 41,000 human transcripts. We performed an analysis aimed at identifying the genes induced or repressed by the pharmacologic treatment, with a particular interest in genes modulated only in CRs or NRs. To this end, we normalized the expression of every gene in each post sample to the expression of the same gene in the matched pre sample. We identified the mRNAs that exhibited a significant differential modulation (p-value < 0.05) after fludarabine treatment, separately analyzing refractory and sensitive CLLs (data not shown). Then, we identified the most significant pathways modulated by fludarabine through a Pathway Enrichment analysis of the two gene lists. Interestingly, the p53 pathway emerged as the most significantly induced pathway in the cohort of CR patients (Table 4). For example, G1/S and G2/M DNA damage checkpoints, p53 stabilization and p53-dependent response, BH3-only proteins pathways were all significantly enriched in the CR cohort of CLL patients. Conversely, the same pathways were not enriched or were less significant in NR patients, indicating that NR CLLs had a dysfunctional p53 pathway. A pathway representative of p53 cell cycle control was generated, coloring the genes with the expression levels in CR and NR groups (Figure 4A), while the average expression level of all the genes involved in p53 pathway is graphically represented in Figure 4B. The above results suggest that an abnormal miRNA expression may be involved in the generation of fludarabine resistance. Among the various miRNAs differentially expressed between NR versus CR patients, miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a emerged as significantly up-regulated in two different cohorts of refractory patients, both before and after fludarabine administration. MiR-21 has a well-established role in protection from apoptosis and drug-response modulation and miR-222 is an important cell cycle regulator through its action on p27. We therefore investigated whether their inhibition could improve fludarabine cell death activity in the human MEG-01 cell model. We employed the MEG-01 cell line because it carries a 13q14 deletion affecting miR-15a/miR-16-1, typical of CLL, and a mutant TP53 gene. ',\n"," 'MiR-16 is indeed down-regulated (fold-change 2.3, p = 0.07) in pre-treatment fludarabine-refractory CLLs, and, as above indicated, NRs are defective in the p53 pathway. These cells may therefore mimic features which are responsible for resistance to fludarabine. We hypothesized that anti-miR-21, 148a and 222 could be implicated in fludarabine-induced apoptotic process. We therefore assayed the MEG-01 cells for Caspase 3/7 activation (Caspase 3/7 Glo assay, Promega); MEG-01 cells were treated for 24 hours with LNA anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-222 or anti-miR-148a followed by addition of fludarabine for additional 24 hours. A significant (p < 0.01) increase of caspase 3/7 activity was detected for miR-21 and miR-222 (Figure 5A, B) while no difference was observed for miR-148a (Figure 5C). We hereby concluded that the high miR-21 and miR-222 levels may be responsible for a weaker apoptotic effect of fludarabine in refractory patients, while the mechanism of action of miR-148a remains to be established. We analyzed the expression profile of 29 CLL patients who were treated by fludarabine, a pivotal drug in the modern treatment of CLL. To better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of fludarabine resistance, we investigated the miRNA expression alterations of patients who received fludarabine as single agent, thus avoiding the potentially confounding elements that are inevitably present when fludarabine is used in combination with other drugs. Moreover, samples were obtained before and after first fludarabine treatment from the same patient, making it possible to directly evaluate the effect of the drug in vivo. Our results revealed that many miRNAs are modulated by fludarabine treatment, as shown by the 37 miRNAs that are modulated following the treatment in both CR and NR patients, while 23 and 30 miRNAs were differentially modulated only in CRs or NRs, respectively, suggesting that these two cohorts of patients show signs of differences in the execution of molecular pathways modulated by fludarabine. Indeed, in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these miRNAs, we analyzed the molecular pathways modulated by fludarabine in sensitive and refractory CLLs that emerged by mRNA expression analysis. The discovery that many p53 pathway genes (i.e. ',\n"," 'CDKN1A, BBC3/PUMA, PCNA, GADD45A) were activated in CRs but not in NRs provides further support to the notion that fludarabine treatment of patients with CLL induces a p53-dependent gene expression response and that a defective p53 pathway in refractory CLLs, due to 17p deletions, p53 mutations and other p53-linked dysfunctions, is associated with fludarabine resistance. It is therefore possible that the differential expression of miRNAs between CR versus NR patients may be affected by a defective p53 pathway. Interestingly, it has been reported that miR-221/222 cluster is repressed by p53, implicating that a non-functional p53 pathway may lead to its up-regulation, as detected in NR patients. An example of an aberrantly expressed miRNA influenced by p53 in fludarabine-refractory CLL has been recently reported by Zenz and colleagues, who observed a higher frequency of fludarabine refractory CLLs in the group of low-expressing miR-34a, than in similar patients with high expression of this miRNA. MiR-34a was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of p53. Although we did not find a significant differential expression level of miR-34a in NR compared with CR CLLs, our data concur with those of Zenz et al., in fact 3 patients with the 17p deletion involved in this study displayed no miR-34a expression (data not shown). By comparing the miRNA expression profile of sensitive and refractory CLLs, we have been able to identify expression signatures that could correctly classify more than 80% of the CR vs NR cases, either before or after treatment. Interestingly, after validation by quantitative PCR of the most significant miRNAs (miR-21, miR-222 and miR-148a) in an independent population, the prediction of response to therapy for pre-therapy samples was impressive: a predictive score based on miRNA expression levels reached an overall accuracy of 100%. This information may have important clinical implications because it might spare subsequent treatment in patients identified as resistant during disease progression. MiRNAs aberrant expression may not only represent a phenomenon able to reveal an underlying molecular defect, such as p53 dysfunction, but it may also represent one of the possible mechanisms responsible for fludarabine resistance. In this study, we found that some miRNAs, namely miR-222, miR-148a and miR-21 were differentially expressed between NR and CR CLLs both before and after fludarabine treatment and were all up-regulated in the NR group. These findings, not previously described in CLL, appears to be truly significant. ',\n"," 'Indeed, miR-222 can target the cell growth suppressive cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p57 and the c-KIT receptor (source: Tarbase) thus promoting cell cycle progression. Among the recently validated targets there are the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BMF, the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which are both involved in tongue carcinoma metastasis promotion and whose expression is frequently altered in cancer. An higher expression of miR-222 has been associated with poor survival in pancreatic cancer and the enforced expression of miR-221/222 improved the growth of prostate carcinoma xenografts in mice. Moreover, anti-sense inhibition of miR-221 could increase susceptibility to gemcitabine. MiR-21 up-regulation appears to be an important mechanism of malignant transformation, since it was found up-regulated in several types of neoplasia (see Spizzo et al. for a list); it accounts, among the known validated targets, numerous tumors suppressor genes, such as TPM1, PDCD4, maspin (SERPINB3) and PTEN (source: Tarbase). New interesting targets of miR-21 were recently identified through the validation of proteomic results. It was also correlated with poor prognosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma, colon, breast and pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, the use of the anti-miR-21 AMOs increases susceptibility of colangiocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine and elicit a pro-apoptotic response in glioblastoma and breast cancer cells. Here, we report that inhibition of miR-222 and miR-21 in the MEG-01 human cells using an anti-miRNA oligonucleotide increases susceptibility to fludarabine, as shown by the significant increase in caspase activity. Our findings suggest a direct role of miR-222 and miR-21 in conferring resistance to fludarabine chemotherapy independently from the p53 pathway, which is dysfunctional in this human cell line. Less clear is the role of miR-148a. MiR-148a is up-regulated in NR CLL patients either before and after fludarabine treatment and it was identified also as resistance predictor in pre CLLs. However, its mechanism of action is not clear, as only two gene targets are presently experimentally validated. One is the isoform 1 of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b1) and the other is the pregnane X receptor gene whose repression, in turn, reduces the expression of CYP3A4 enzyme. Our assay revealed that its mechanism of action may not be linked to apoptosis inhibition in resistant patients. Therefore, its role in fludarabine resistance remains unknown. ',\n"," 'This study revealed that a characteristic miRNA expression profile, as assessed before and soon after start of treatment, can discriminate between fludarabine sensitive and fludarabine resistant CLLs. We confirm the importance of a defective p53 pathway in conferring fludarabine resistance. This mechanism may be relevant in affecting miRNA expression; however, we suggest that an aberrant miRNA expression, i.e. up-regulation of miR-21, miR-148a and miR-222 in NRs, may be important in establishing resistance independently from p53, protecting cells from apoptosis. Indeed, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 may increase sensitivity to fludarabine in vitro in a p53-mutant cell line. The differential expression of a small number of miRNAs can have an effect on the capability to respond to fludarabine in CLL patients and can be used for response prediction. Therefore our data may help identify those elderly patients unlikely to respond to fludarabine used as single agent and may assist in the definition of the induction treatment in younger patients, given the availability of non cross-resistant drugs, such as bendamustine. This information may have an impact in the development of personalized therapeutic approaches. Seventeen patients (training set) plus 12 patients (test set) followed at our centre and treated with fludarabine as single agent (25 mg/sqm/day for 5 consecutive days for six courses given at 28 day intervals) were enrolled in this study after obtaining informed consent. The training set patients received fludarabine as first line treatment in 4 cases and as second line treatment after chlorambucil in 13 cases. All the patients had typical morphologic features (i.e. majority of small lymphocytes with clumped chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli) and a high immunophenotypic score (i.e. CD5/CD19+, CD23+, CD22 weak positive, surface immunoglobulin weak+, FMC7-), consistent with an unequivocal diagnosis of CLL. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed as previously described as part of the diagnostic workup before treatment. Response to treatment was defined according to NCI criteria and patients were divided in two groups, i.e. those attaining a clinical response (CR) including partial and complete responders and those who did not respond to treatment (NR). For miRNA/mRNA expression studies, peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were separated to a >97% as previously described. In each patient of the training cohort, cells were collected one day before the start of the first course of fludarabine and on day 5 of treatment.

Filters on gene expression were used to keep only the miRNAs/mRNA expressed in at least one sample (flagged as P). Then, samples were grouped in accordance to treatment (pre and post fludarabine) and response to treatment (NR and CR). Differentially expressed genes were selected as having a n-fold expression difference between their geometrical mean among the groups of interest and a statistically significant p-value (<0.05) by Welch t-test statistic.

Differentially expressed genes were employed in Cluster Analysis, using the Manhattan correlation as a measure of similarity and the complete linkage rule for genes and samples clusterization. The identification of mRNAs modulated after fludarabine, in matched samples, was done using the filter on 0-10th percentile in at least 75% of patients, for the miRNAs down-modulated by treatment, and a filter on 90-100th percentile in at least 75% of patients, for the miRNAs up-modulated by treatment.

',\n"," 'Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in phase II clinical development for treatment of various forms of cancer. When administered with a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed dosing schedule, flavopiridol exhibited striking activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study aimed to evaluate pharmacogenetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and outcomes associated with flavopiridol therapy. Thirty-five patients who received single-agent flavopiridol via the PK-directed schedule were genotyped for 189 polymorphisms in genes encoding 56 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Genotypes were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as covariates in a population PK model. Transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in uptake assays in HEK-293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1. Polymorphisms in ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and SLCO1B1 were found to significantly correlate with flavopiridol PK in univariate analysis. Transport assay results indicated both flavopiridol and flavopiridol-glucuronide are substrates of the SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 transporter. Covariates incorporated into the final population PK model included bilirubin, SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. Associations were also observed between genotype and response. To validate these findings, a second set of data with 51 patients was evaluated, and overall trends for associations between PK and PGx were found to be consistent. Polymorphisms in transport genes were found to be associated with flavopiridol disposition and outcomes. Observed clinical associations with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated indicating for the first time its relevance as a transporter of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. A second 51-patient dataset indicated similar trends between genotype in the SLCO1B1 and other candidate genes, thus providing support for these findings. Further study in larger patient populations will be necessary to fully characterize and validate the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other transporter and metabolizing enzyme genes on outcomes from flavopiridol therapy. Flavopiridol (Alvocidib, NSC 649890), is a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that broadly targets cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including the cyclin 9/cyclin T complex (pTEF-b), preventing activation of RNA polymerase II. Flavopiridol initiates cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis through down-regulation of Mcl-1 and X-linked inactivator of apoptosis (XIAP) . These preclinical characteristics provided the rationale for clinical investigation of flavopiridol in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as advanced CLL is commonly associated with elevated Mcl-1 and dysfunctional p53, rendering standard treatments such as alkylating agents, fludarabine and rituximab ineffective. Single agent flavopiridol administered with 72-, 24- and 1-hour infusion schedules produced limited activity in hematologic and solid tumor diseases. ',\n"," 'Phase I and II studies using flavopiridol in combination with other agents utilizing the various schedules obtained mixed results, although partial and complete responses in these trials indicated potential synergy of flavopiridol with chemotherapy. We previously reported overall response rates of 40-50% in patients with refractory CLL when flavopiridol was administered as a single agent using a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed schedule. A phase II registration trial is underway for unmet need in refractory CLL patients using this PK-directed schedule. The activity of the PK-directed schedule in CLL, compared to that of the previously evaluated schedules, clearly indicted the importance of flavopiridol PK for clinical activity, and associations were in fact observed between PK and clinical outcomes, including response, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). However, a substantial amount of variability in PK, as well as in response and toxicity, was unexplained by demographic, patient and disease characteristics. We therefore sought to determine the role of pharmacogenetic factors in flavopiridol PK and treatment outcomes within this patient population. Flavopiridol elimination occurs via excretion and metabolism and is known through in vitro studies to be influenced by the multi-drug resistance protein-2 (MRP2, ABCC2) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2), which contribute to biliary excretion of both parent drug and glucuronide metabolites. Glucuronide conjugation to the 5- and 7-hydroxy positions of flavopiridol by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoforms 1A1 and 1A9 (UGT1A1 and UGT1A9, respectively) accounts for the majority of metabolic transformation of flavopiridol. Polymorphic diversity in these and other genes may influence flavopiridol disposition, activity and toxicity in a manner similar to irinotecan disposition. Limited polymorphism effects on flavopiridol interactions have been reported, including a lack of observed effects on clinical PK and in vitro substrate specificity. Although polymorphisms were not directly evaluated by Innocenti and colleagues, their clinical report suggested flavopiridol:metabolite ratio as a possible predictor of diarrhea with flavopiridol treatment and provided a rationale for evaluation of a genetic link with UGT isoforms. In this report, we present pharmacogenetic (PGx) data for drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) in a subset of 35 patients treated in a phase I study of a PK-derived 4.5-hour dosing schedule of single-agent flavopiridol in relapsed CLL. These data comprise a focused analysis of candidate genes known through in vitro studies to interact with flavopiridol, as well as a broader exploratory evaluation of additional DMET genes. ',\n"," 'interact with flavopiridol, as well as a broader exploratory evaluation of additional DMET genes. The results indicate a novel link between flavopiridol PK and SLCO1B1, as well as functional evidence for OATP1B1 (the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 protein product of SLCO1B1) transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. Preliminary analysis of these associations in a second dataset comprising 51 patients provided additional support for the validity of associations between PK, transporter and UGT1A1 genes and their potential clinical relevance. Importantly, pharmacogenetic factors explain a significant portion of inter-patient variability and improves the accuracy of a developing population PK model for this agent. Samples were obtained from patients who provided informed written consent and were enrolled on clinical protocol NCI-5746 (NCT00058240, ClinicalTrials.gov). The sample collection and analyses reported in this study were outlined in the clinical protocol, as approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient demographics and disease characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes and PK results, were reported previously. DNA was obtainable from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 35 of the 52 patients on study. Demographics, baseline labs and disease characteristics for these patients are presented in Table 1. Genes known from in vitro studies to specifically affect flavopiridol disposition include UGT1A1, UGT1A9, ABCC2 and ABCG2. These and an additional set of 52 other genes that code for metabolic enzymes and transporters commonly involved in drug disposition were evaluated for the presence of known polymorphisms by direct sequencing and with a high-throughput SNPlex assay (Applied Biosystems). Genomic DNA was extracted from patient PBMCs and used to sequence promoter TATA box regions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 and specifically to identify the presence of the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*22 polymorphisms. Primers for UGT promoter sequencing were as follows: 1A1-forward, 5\\' - GGAAGTACTTTGCTGTGTTCACTCAAG; 1A1-reverse, 5\\' - AAGGGTCCGTCAGCATGACATCAA; 1A9-forward, 5\\' - CTTAACATTGCAGCACAGGGCATGTT; 1A9-reverse, 5\\' - CGTACTTGTGCTTTCCATTGAGCATGGG.\"] All sequence data was deposited in GenBank. To validate sequence results of the TATA box regions, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) specific primers were used in a fluorescence/gel-migration assay. Polymorphism-specific primers were utilized in the SNPlex assay to identify the presence of 189 other SNPs in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. A complete list of the genes and SNPs evaluated was presented previously. A population PK (popPK) model for 50 patients on study was previously reported. ',\n"," 'This model served as the starting point to evaluate SNPs and other covariates for the subset of 35 patients with PGx data using NONMEM VI (Icon, Hanover, MD). With first order conditional estimation, a base structural model was built with proportional and additive residual error considering both between-subject variability (BSV) and between-occasion variability (BOV) on PK parameters, since PK data was available on two occasions from patients who received escalated doses. Initial screening of the genetic data was completed with the allelic association test in HelixTree software (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT) which produced unadjusted p-values for correlation with each of the base model-predicted PK parameters. Of the 189 SNPs (191 total including the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*29 promoter polymorphisms from direct sequencing), 16 SNPs in 4 genes known previously to interact with flavopiridol (UGT1A1/9, ABCC2 and ABCG2), were retained for further analysis. From the remaining 175 total SNPs in 52 genes that were known to be involved in drug disposition, we filtered out from consideration SNPs with p-values>0.05 and minor allele frequencies less than 0.15. For direct fitting of selected polymorphisms to PK parameters, SNPs were converted to dichotomous categorical variables whereby the heterozygous category (M/m) for the major (M) and minor (m) alleles was combined with either the major or minor allele category as previously reported. Demographic, baseline laboratory covariates, and the total of 43 SNPs from above screening were then introduced with general additive modeling (GAM) and visual inspection of diagnostic plots using R v.2.9.0 and Xpose 4.0.4. These covariates identified by visual inspection and GAM as potentially meaningful (according to the Akaike information criterion, AIC) were introduced into the population model for further evaluation of the SNP associations. Using GAM, four sets of covariates including SNPs were retained for further evaluation in a full structural model. For completeness, each individual covariate was fit to the structural model using the power (equation 1) or fractional change (equation 2) models, where thetai is the individual PK parameter estimate, thetapop is the population parameter estimate for the typical individual, and etai is the sum of BSV and BOV parameters approximately log-normally distributed with standard deviations omega about a mean of 0. ',\n"," 'CONji is the value of the continuous covariate j for individual I, CONj-med is the population median value of covariate j for all individuals, CATji is the value of the categorical covariate j for individual i, and Thetaj is an estimated parameter. All covariates were evaluated in this way with the full 50-patient dataset, except for the SNPs which were evaluated after removal of individuals for whom no genetic data was available. To identify a final multivariate model for all of the PK parameters simultaneously, we used selection methods that depend on changes in the objective function value. Using a cutoff of p<=.05, which corresponded to a minimum decrease of the objective function value (OFV) of 3.84 upon inclusion of each individual covariate based on the likelihood-ratio test, multivariate analysis with forward stepwise inclusion, backward stepwise deletion, and forward selection followed by backward elimination were applied to finalize the covariate model. Model selection in multivariate analysis was based on 1) minimum reduction of OFV by 3.84 (P<=0.05) for forward inclusion, 2) reduction of OFV by 6.64 or greater (P<=0.01) for backward deletion, and 3) decrease in residual error and/or BSV of the evaluated PK parameter. Interaction between covariates was examined by scatter plot of covariate values and change of OFV between models with single or combined covariates. For bias evaluation the final model was fitted to replicate datasets using the bootstrap resampling technique in Wings for NONMEM, and PK parameter estimates and random effects for each of the replicate datasets were obtained. Two hundred replicate bootstrap datasets were generated and used for evaluation of parameter estimate precision. Model precision was evaluated by comparing mean parameter values and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CI) of the replicates with NONMEM outputs. The human SLC01B1 gene was isolated from the HEP-G2 cell line using methods similar to those previously published. Briefly, RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent and each half of the gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pcr-blunt II Topo vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The second half of the gene was digested with NotI and SnaBI and combined with the first half in the pcr-blunt II topo vector. The full length clone was then digested with KpnI and NotI and transferred into pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen).

Flavopiridol was obtained from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Flavopiridol-glucuronide (flavo-G) was extracted from patient urine and purified. Total urine through 24-hours after the start of flavopiridol dosing was collected from patients enrolled in an IRB-approved phase II protocol (NCI-7000). Octanol extraction followed by C-18 solid phase extraction was employed to isolate flavo-G from flavopiridol and other urine components. To quantify recovered flavo-G and verify purity, samples were incubated with beta-Glucuronidase as previously described and quantified via LC-MS/MS analysis with methods modified from those previously reported. Purity was estimated at >95% via mass and UV chromatography.

Calculated uptake velocities were normalized to total protein in each well, and results were compared against empty vector controls using Student\\'s t-test.\"] To identify associations with genetics, the means of flavopiridol and flavo-G PK parameters were compared based on SNP genotypes using Student\\'s t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\"] For comparisons of PGx and clinical outcomes, SNP genotypes and response or toxicity grading was evaluated using Fisher\\'s exact test.\"] P-values were not further adjusted for multiple testing. DNA of adequate quality and quantity for analysis was available from 35 of the 52 patients treated on study, and both SNPlex and direct sequencing data were generated for these individuals (see Table 1 for demographics and pre-treatment characteristics of this patient subset). In addition to the 4 genes of interest, 17 genes and 27 SNPs met our criteria for further study (see Table 3). Among these, SLCO1B1 was selected for further evaluation given its known physiological relevance for a broad set of drugs and its potential role of transporting flavopiridol into liver for subsequent metabolism and excretion. A total of 577 plasma concentration-time values from 50 of 52 patients in the clinical study were included for PK data analysis using two-compartmental kinetics with first-order elimination, as described previously. Based on this previous analysis, BSV was initially assumed on each parameter in the model. However, removal of BSV for V1 did not significantly change OFV (increase of 1 unit). After removal of BSV on V1, addition of BOV on single or multiple parameters was tested in the model. Addition of BOV on clearance (CL) resulted in the most significant change in OFV. The final base model thus included BSV on CL, inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and volume of peripheral compartment (V2), and BOV on CL. Base model parameter estimates and random effects are presented in Table 4. ',\n"," 'Demographic and lab covariates from GAM screening were subsequently evaluated in the base model with univariate analysis (see Table 5). With the modified random error in the base model, bilirubin was indicated as the most significant covariate with a direct positive effect on Q. Addition of bilirubin decreased OFV by 8.07 and BSV (on Q) from 63.64% to 55.41% (see Figure 1). To evaluate genetic covariates, the dataset was reduced by removing patients for whom no genetic data was available. This reduced the dataset from 50 to 35 subjects and from 577 to 388 records. Univariate analysis on genetic covariates with this dataset identified the 14 most significant covariate-parameter relationships (see Table 6). Using the selection methods discussed above, we retained in all of the final models SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. The relationships between these SNPs and their respective base model-estimated PK parameters are displayed in Figure 2. Although associations between PK and SNPs in ABCC2 may have been expected due to known in vitro interactions of MRP2 and flavopiridol, no such evidence existed prior to this study for the role of SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 in flavopiridol transport. To determine if the observed associations between flavopiridol PK and SLCO1B1 PGx were functionally relevant for flavopiridol disposition, we measured uptake of flavopiridol and flavo-G in cells transfected with SLCO1B1. Transfection efficiencies were estimated at approximately 60% using GFP-containing control vectors. Mean uptake velocities were 261+-12 fmol/mg protein/10 min and 38+-10 fmol/mg protein/30 min for flavopiridol and flavo-G, respectively, in MDCK-II cells. Flavopiridol transport rates in HEK-293 cells were approximately 2-3 fold higher than in MDCK-II cells suggesting its transport may be affected by the different membrane and transporter compositions in the two cell lines. Flavo-G transport rates were similar in both cell lines. Figure 3 shows normalized uptake velocities of flavopiridol and flavo-G in both HEK293 and MDCK-II cells transfected with either SLCO1B1 or empty vector. Expression of the transfected SLCO1B1 gene was verified with real-time PCR (data not shown). Functional expression of OATP1B1 was verified by evaluating uptake of a positive control substrate, SN-38. A second agent, lenalidomide, was used as a negative control substrate. Total intracellular accumulation and Initial transport velocities of SN-38, flavopiridol, and flavo-G were significantly increased in HEK293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1, compared to empty control vectors, whereas no increased uptake was shown for lenalidomide. ',\n"," 'We further evaluated the uptake of flavopiridol in MDCK-II cells transfected with the SLCO1B1 polymorphic variants with amino acid changes relative to the reference sequence (i.e. nonsynonymous SNPs). These included rs11045819 (T155P), rs2306283 (D130N), and rs4149056 (V174A). The results indicated significant decreases in flavopiridol transport rates (t-test p-value<0.05) for the rs11045819 and rs4149056 variants, but the transport rate of the rs2306283 polymorph was similar to that in the reference SLCO1B1 transporter. Figure 4 displays these results. To arrive at a final model with significant PGx, lab and demographic covariates, the reduced data set was used to reevaluate the demographic and lab covariates retained after univariate analysis with the full dataset (see Table 6). Bilirubin effect on Q was apparent and remained the most significant demographic or lab covariate with the reduced dataset. However, significant effects of blood urea nitrogen on CL and alanine aminotransferase on V2 that were observed in the full dataset disappeared with use of the reduced dataset. The remaining four significant demographic or lab covariates and the two significant SNPs (SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710) were then evaluated by forward addition and backward deletion. Only the two SNPs and bilirubin were retained as significant covariates with the reduced dataset. Relative to the base model, the final model displayed an OFV reduction of 34.11. Table 7 lists the final model parameter estimates. The bootstrap method was used to assess bias in the final covariate model. From the reduced data set, 200 replicate data sets were generated and used for the evaluation of the stability of the final covariate model. Table 8 lists the results of the bootstrap procedure, presented as mean and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals of the parameter estimates and random effects of the final model. Mean estimated parameter values from the bootstrap were within 11% of the parameter estimates of the original data set indicating reliability in the developed model. Flavo-G PK parameter estimates reported previously in 27 pts on study were evaluated to identify PGx associations. The trends observed indicated that fewer TA repeats in the UGT1A1 promoter were weakly associated with lower flavo-G Cmax (2.17+/-0.99 vs. 5.08+/-4.12 microM) and AUC (26.43+/-30.26 vs. 66.16+/-64.37 hr* microM) (p = .057 and .077, respectively). Only two transporter SNPs were associated with flavo-G PK. ',\n"," 'The SLCO1B1 rs2306283 SNP correlated with flavo-G plasma concentrations (the total time in hours flavo-G concentrations were below 1.5 microM, p = .019), and the ABCG2 rs1564481 SNP was associated with flavo-G AUC (p = .050). We also evaluated flavopiridol AUC with respect to PGx, and one trend was observed with the ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP (p = 0.08). Bilirubin levels were not associated with SNPs in UGT1A1, but the SLCO1B1 rs3829310 minor C allele was associated with higher baseline bilirubin (p = .011). These relationships are presented in Figure 5. To determine if the presence of polymorphisms was significantly associated with outcomes, clinical response and the primary toxicities (TLS, diarrhea and CRS) were evaluated against PGx. Results indicated SNPs in SLCO1B1 and ABCG2, but not in UGT1A1/9 or ABCC2, were associated with response. SNPs significantly associated with improved response included the SCLO1B1 rs11045819 (CC genotype, p = .041) and ABCG2 rs1564481 (T allele, p = .037). The SLCO1B1 rs2306283 SNP alone did not meet the significance criteria (T allele, p = .061), but the combination of this and the SLCO1B1 rs11045819 SNP was significant (p = .007). No SNPs met the significance criteria when compared against TLS, although the most closely associated SNP was SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (C allele, p = .056). Similaraly, the most closely associated SNPs with diarrhea and CRS were SCLO1B1 rs2306283 (T allele, p = .055) and ABCG2 rs1564481 (T allele, p = .074). To evaluate the validity of the findings from the 35-patient dataset, a second dataset was evaluated for associations between PGx and PK. The validation set comprised data from 66 CLL patients who were treated with the same flavopiridol dosing regimen in a separate phase II study (NCI-7000, NCT00098371). As with the phase I study, enrolled patients provided informed written consent, and plasma and PBMC samples were obtained according to The Ohio State University IRB approved protocol. Clinical results of this study were reported previously. Plasma and DNA samples from this study were analyzed using the methods described above to generate flavopiridol and flavo-G concentration-time data, PK parameter estimates, and PGx data for each patient. Covariates found to be significantly associated in univariate analysis with the phase I dataset, including demographic and baseline laboratory covariates and SNPs in UGT1A1, ABCC2, ABCG2 and SLCO1B1, were compared with the phase II pharmacokinetic data. Significant associations and trends were observed with the validation dataset. ',\n"," 'For flavopiridol PK, these included significant associations between the SCLO1B1 rs2306283 SNP and Q (p = 0.02) and between both the ABCG2 rs2622624 and rs3114018 SNPs and CL and V1 (rs2622624, p = 0.008 and 0.04; rs3114018, p = 0.004 and 0.006 for CL and V1, respectively). The SLCO1B1 rs3829310 SNP was weakly associated with flavopiridol CL and AUC (p = 0.08 and 0.08, respectively). The ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP showed a similar trend with AUC (p = .08). For flavo-G, significant associations included Cmax and AUC with the UGT1A1*28 promotor SNP (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Bilirubin levels were significantly associated with the SLCO1B1 rs3829310 and SLCO1B1 rs2291075 SNPs (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). Figure 6 displays a subset of these relationships. Safe and effective use of flavopiridol will require a thorough understanding of the factors influencing the onset of hyper-acute tumor lysis syndrome and inter-individual variability in response. We previously reported that at least some of the variability in outcomes may be explained by PK, yet significant portions of this variability remain unexplained. In this first evaluation of pharmacogenetics using the flavopiridol PK-derived schedule, we identified a novel flavopiridol-transporter interaction and confirmed its functional relevance in vitro. Furthermore, a subset of the polymorphisms evaluated in this study was significantly associated with outcomes. The striking activity of this dosing schedule in CLL and flavopiridol\\'s emerging activity with combination chemotherapy in other diseases demand these pharmacogenetic and other factors be identified and further characterized.\"] To expand on our previous evaluation of flavopiridol using the PK-directed schedule, we sought to characterize the role of PGx in flavopiridol disposition. We combined focused and exploratory approaches, whereby PK data from a phase I dataset was evaluated against SNPs in candidate genes previously shown to metabolize or transport flavopiridol in in vitro studies, as well as SNPs in genes not known to interact with flavopiridol. The candidate genes evaluated included ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. Indeed, at least one SNP in each of these genes was significantly associated in univariate analysis with flavopiridol and flavo-G PK. In multivariate analysis with the phase I dataset, a single SNP in ABCC2 (rs8187710) remained significant. This is a non-synonymous SNP resulting in a C1515Y alteration and is part of a haplotype with the rs17222723 SNP (also a non-synonymous SNP with a V1188E residue change). ',\n"," 'This haplotype has been reported to be associated with PBMC accumulation of lopinavir, susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This is a relatively infrequent SNP, and only 5 of 35 and 4 of 51 individuals were genotyped for the polymorphic A allele in the phase I and II datasets, respectively. Significant associations between this SNP and PK parameters were not observed in the phase II dataset. Although UGT1A1 SNPs were not included in the final popPK model, both flavopiridol and flavo-G were correlated with the UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism, and fewer TA repeats (6 and 7) were associated with lower flavo-G concentrations and AUC in both the phase I and II datasets. One of the most broadly studied substrates of UGT1A1 and 1A9 is irinotecan/SN-38, which shares metabolic pathways and has a similar toxicity profile (diarrhea) with flavopiridol. Interestingly, the *3 polymorphism of 1A9 was previously shown to be associated with SN-38 but not flavopiridol disposition. Innocenti and colleagues measured ratios of flavo-G:flavopiridol and identified an indirect relationship between flavo-G levels and diarrhea. Zhai and colleagues reported PK and UGT1A1 polymorphism data in 49 patients with refractory neoplasms treated with 1-hour IV flavopiridol. However, their results indicated no correlation of the TATA box promoter UGT1A1*28 genotype with flavopiridol PK or diarrhea severity. While we did not identify correlations with diarrhea for flavopiridol and flavo-G PK, we observed one association with PGx and diarrhea. The 35-patient dataset evaluated in this study was small with regard to exploratory PGx, and therefore an additional dataset from 51 patients was used to evaluate the validity of the findings. While the associations identified in each dataset were not identical, similar trends were observed between PK parameters and SNPs in the candidate genes. Furthermore, the clinical associations we observed with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated in vitro. SLCO1B1 is important for the disposition of statin drugs and various anti-cancer agents including irinotecan. It was recently highlighted by the International Transporter Consortium as one of the seven most relevant transporters for drug development due to its broad substrate specificity, potential for drug-drug interactions, and clinically relevant polymorphisms. Importantly, functional transport data indicated this gene may play a role in hepatic uptake of both flavopiridol and flavo-G. ',\n"," 'All five of the SLCO1B1 SNPs evaluated in the phase I dataset were significant in univariate analysis, and two of these (rs11045819 on V1 and rs4149056 on CL) were the strongest associations observed of any covariates evaluated for flavopiridol PK in multivariate analysis. These are non-synonymous SNPs affecting the amino acid sequence in OATP1B1. Previous studies indicated these variants were associated with reduced uptake activity of the OATP1B1 substrates estrone-3-sulfate, estradiol-17beta-d-glucuronide, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, pravastatin, the SN-38 metabolite of irinotecan and rifampicin in. These reports are consistent with our in vitro data which indicated these SNPs significantly reduced flavopiridol transport, while the other nonsynonymous SNP evaluated (rs2306283) had no measureable effect. Interestingly, this was the only SLCO1B1 SNP significantly associated with flavo-G PK. A recently reported study in MDCK-II cells with this SNP indicated increased transport of bromosulfophthalein and decreased transport of cholyltaurine. Collectively, the data may suggest that the altered protein sequence affects OATP1B1 transport of flavopiridol and flavo-G differently. Further in vitro evaluations of these and other SNPs will be required to characterize their functional impact with respect to flavopiridol and flavo-G disposition. Additionally, the data presented suggests flavopridol may be a weak substrate of SLCO1B1 in comparison with SN-38 under the evaluated experimental conditions. However, characterization of the kinetics of flavopiridol and flavo-G transport via SLCO1B1 will be necessary for understanding the full impact this gene has on overall flavopiridol disposition. The observed associations between PGx and outcomes in this study are encouraging as potential indicators for patient response. While no SNP met the significance criteria for association with TLS, the polymorphism most closely associated with this toxicity was SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (ANOVA p = .056). The strength of the associations between PK, outcomes and multiple SNPs in SLCO1B1 and the confirmation of functional OATP1B1 transport of both flavopiridol and flavo-G support the potential for this gene to be clinically relevant in patients receiving flavopiridol treatment. Overall, analysis of the phase II dataset revealed significant associations with the candidate genes that were supportive of the findings from the phase I dataset. In particular, trends in flavopiridol AUC with respect to the ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP and flavo-G Cmax and AUC with respect to the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism were strikingly similar between the two datasets (see Figures 5 and 6). Again, further validation of these associations will be essential in larger datasets. ',\n"," 'This work modifies and develops further our previously reported population model for the PK-directed schedule of flavopiridol. We demonstrate the most significant covariates in the phase I dataset to be polymorphisms in two transporter genes, SCLO1B1 and ABCC2, and the phase II validation set revealed significant associations with polymorphisms in ABCG2. While larger data sets are necessary to fully characterize the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other genes on flavopiridol PK, our findings are supportive of a clinically significant role for PGx in flavopiridol disposition. The composite data to date suggests inter-individual variability in outcomes from flavopiridol therapy will be due to a combination of pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and potentially other factors related to tumor cell sensitivity to flavopiridol\\'s cytotoxic effects.\"] Inter-individual variability is of particular concern for chemotherapeutic drugs with relatively narrow therapeutic windows. The developing model for flavopiridol PK may ultimately help to explain this variability by incorporating pharmacogenetic and other significant factors. With sufficient data and validation, this model may ultimately serve as a tool for predicting PK and associated outcomes in individuals prior to therapy. If sufficiently robust, such a tool would be clinically useful in identifying individuals likely to respond and/or experience severe TLS or other toxicities upon receiving flavopiridol. ',\n"," 'CLL cells treated with dasatinib in vitro undergo apoptosis via inhibition of Lyn kinase. Thus, in this study we tested the activity of dasatinib in patients with relapsed CLL. Patients were eligible for this phase 2 trial if they had documented CLL/SLL and had failed at least one prior therapy with a fludarabine-containing regimen and if they required therapy according to NCI-WG criteria. The starting dose of dasatinib was 140 mg daily. Fifteen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 59 and a median of 3 prior regimens. All patients had received fludarabine, and 5 were fludarabine-refractory. Eleven of the 15 (73%) had high risk del(11q) or del(17p) cytogenetics. The primary toxicity was myelosuppression, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 10 and 6 patients, respectively. Partial responses by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI 6-44). Among the remaining 12 patients, 5 had nodal responses by physical exam, and 1 patient had a nodal and lymphocyte response but with severe myelosuppression. Pharmacodynamic studies indicated apoptosis in peripheral blood CLL cells within 3-6 hours after dasatinib administration, associated with downregulation of syk mRNA. Dasatinib as a single agent has activity in relapsed and refractory CLL. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the Western world and remains incurable outside of the bone marrow transplant setting. While the median survival for all newly diagnosed patients is over 10 years, there is significant patient to patient variability. For patients who relapse after initial treatment, survival varies from about 3 years in good risk patients treated aggressively to 9-13 months in fludarabine-refractory patients. The reasons for progression and treatment resistance are currently under intensive investigation. CLL cells are believed to proliferate and escape apoptosis in large part from signal pathways originating from the B-cell receptor (BCR). Although the precise mechanisms likely differ between heavy chain mutated and unmutated CLLs, in both forms of the disease Src family kinases (SFKs) are overexpressed, are aberrantly located in the cytosol outside of lipid rafts, and appear to play a crucial role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. In unmutated CLL cells, the signaling from the BCR follows a pattern similar to that in normal B-cells. ',\n"," 'These cells respond to antigen engagement with translocation of the BCR to lipid rafts, where the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located in the intracellular tails of the BCR become phosphorylated by the SFK Lyn. The BCR then phosphorylates Syk kinase, resulting in downstream activation of PI3K, Akt and Mcl-1 as well as MEK/ERK. These events result in enhanced proliferation and survival. In mutated CLL cells, little response to BCR engagement is seen, and no migration of the BCR to lipid rafts is seen. Instead, these cells show constitutive activation of Lyn kinase outside lipid rafts in the cytosol with continual signaling of proliferation and survival pathways. In both mutated and unmutated CLL cells, inhibition of Lyn kinase by selective inhibitors enhanced apoptosis of these cells in vitro through a caspase-dependent mechanism, further demonstrating the key role of Lyn in CLL. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor derived from an aminothiazole scaffold and was originally developed as a pan-Src kinase inhibitor. Once dasatinib was found to bind Abl with an affinity over 100 times that of imatinib mesylate, its development focused on CML, with successful clinical trials leading to its FDA approval in 2006 for the treatment of CML resistant to imatinib. However, dasatinib also inhibits Lyn kinase in vitro with an IC50 of 11 nM, similar to the 1-10 nM IC50 of dasatinib for BCR-ABL. The inhibition of Lyn kinase by dasatinib has been tested in K562 cell lines resistant to imatinib mesylate, and in these cells, apoptosis correlated with inhibition of Lyn phosphorylation. Dasatinib has been extensively studied in CML, initially at doses of 35 mg to 70 mg BID. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the peak concentration of dasatinib occurred at approximately 2 hours while the half life was approximately 5 hours. Dasatinib was well tolerated. In a Phase I trial of dasatinib, CML cells from patients resistant to imatinib mesylate showed rapid and sustained inhibition of Lyn kinase. With the understanding that Lyn kinase may be critical for CLL survival, and given Lyn could be inhibited by dasatinib at tolerable doses, we initiated this phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The use of 140 mg once daily was chosen due to emerging data that the once daily schedule was potentially less toxic and at least as effective in patients with CML. ',\n"," '2 study of dasatinib given once daily to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. The study was undertaken from 2007 to 2008 at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, institutions of the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. The primary objective of the study was to determine the overall response rate by NCI-WG criteria. Secondary objectives were to determine the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, spectrum of toxicities, and pharmacodynamic studies to demonstrate Lyn kinase inhibition and caspase activation by dasatinib in peripheral blood CLL cells. Eligible patients needed to have relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, defined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, with an immunophenotype positive for CD5, CD19, and CD23, with the exception that patients with CD23 negative cells could be eligible as long as cyclin D1 staining was also negative (ruling out mantle cell lymphoma). Patients needed to be at least 18 years of age, have failed at least 1 prior fludarabine containing regimen or at least 2 non-fludarabine containing regimens, have an ECOG performance status of 2 or better, creatinine <3.0 mg/dl, SGOT <3 x ULN (upper limit of normal), ANC >1,000/ul, platelets >50,000/ul, and reticulocyte count <10%. Patients were required to be in need of treatment according to NCI-WG guidelines. Women were excluded if pregnant, breast-feeding, or unwilling to use an acceptable form of contraception if of child-bearing potential. Additional exclusion criteria included uncontrolled angina, a prolonged QT interval at baseline (QTc >450 ms), clinically significant arrhythmias, significant hypertension, or known HIV infection. Drugs known to interfere with platelet function had to be stopped at least 7 days prior to starting dasatinib. The institutional review board of the participating institutions (Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center IRB) approved this study and provided oversight for the duration of the trial. The data were analyzed primarily by P.C.A., E.C.A., D.N., L.W., and J.R.B, but all authors had access to the primary clinical trial data. The clinical trial registration number and name are NCT00438854 and \"Dasatinib in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\". All patients were required to give written informed consent, and the trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients began protocol treatment with a starting daily oral dose of dasatinib of 140 mg (a combination of two 20 mg and two 50 mg pills) and could continue treatment for up to 24 months if responding and without significant toxicity. ',\n"," 'Dasatinib was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Treatment was intended to be continuous, with no planned rest period or breaks. Non-hematologic toxicities were graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3.0, and hematologic toxicities according to the 1996 NCI-WG guidelines. In the event of unacceptable toxicity, defined as any grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicity or any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity, the treatment was held until resolution of the toxicity to grade 1 or less. According to the degree of toxicity, drug could be re-instituted at the same dose or with a dose reduction to 100 mg or 80 mg daily. If the 80 mg daily dose was not tolerated, the patient was taken off protocol due to toxicity. Supportive measures such as blood product support and growth factor administration were allowed at the discretion of the treating physician, with no prophylactic anti-infective therapy mandated. Patients with progression of disease were removed from study. Prior to study treatment, patients underwent the following baseline evaluations: history, physical exam (nodes measured by ruler), complete blood count (CBC), chemistries, liver function tests, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in women, ECG, CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics with analysis by FISH for del(11q), +12, del(13q), and del(17p). Expression of ZAP70 by CLL cells was determined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. In the first month of treatment, CBC, chemistries, and liver function tests were performed at least weekly along with ECGs to assess the QTc interval. For the first 6 months, similar laboratory studies were required at least monthly along with an ECG for QTc assessment. At 2 month intervals up to the 6-month time-point, CT scans were repeated to help assess their impact on response (though not required for NCI-WG criteria). Also at the 2-month time point, a bone marrow biopsy was performed on all patients as a part of response assessment. After 6 months, CT scans were required every 6 months. A bone marrow biopsy was required to confirm a clinical CR or at the time of disease progression, but was not required if patients were removed from the study due to other reasons such as toxicity. ',\n"," \"For a subset of patients who consented to participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study, plasma samples were obtained prior to the first dose of dasatinib and at 3, 6 and 24 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of dasatinib were measured as previously described. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients at baseline, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours after the first dose of dasatinib and prior to day 8 of therapy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were enriched by depleting non-lymphoid cells using the RosetteSep Human B Cell Enrichment Cocktail (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). For analysis of apoptosis, samples of enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes (EPBLs) were stained with anti-Caspase 3 antibody-FITC (Beckton Dickinson) and then fixed in paraformaldehyde and ethanol. Tunel staining was performed using the APO-BRDU Tunel Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), except that anti-BRDU-Alexa Fluor 488 was replaced with anti-BRDU-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). For analysis of protein and phosphoprotein levels, EPBLs were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Sigma). The total protein concentration was identified using the BSA kit (Peirce). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for detection of phophoprotein levels. For p-Lyn, the human phospho-Lyn (Y397) DuoSet IC (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) kit was utilized using 2 ug of total protein lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions. For p-Syk, an ELISA plate was coated with rabbit anti-human p-Syk primary capture antibody (Cell Signaling) and the plate was blocked with BSA. A total of 2 ug of total protein sample lysate was incubated and the plate washed. A mouse anti-human Syk antibody (Sigma) was then added followed by goat anti-mouse biotin and, then streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (both from R & D Systems). The plates were read colorimetrically and the amount of phosphoprotein was expressed as a ratio to the total protein concentration. RNA from EPBLs was extracted, processed, and applied to Affymetrix Human Plus 2.0 microarrays according to standard protocol. Nucleic acid quality was confirmed using gel electrophoresis. The primary objective of this phase II study was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL treated with dasatinib. The primary measures of efficacy of tumor response were: complete remission (CR), nodular partial remission (nPR), or partial remission (PR), as per NCI-WG criteria. \",\n"," 'The true ORR is reported as percentage and 90% CI calculated using the binomial exact test. Patient clinical characteristics are summarized using numbers and percentages for categorical variables, median and range for continuous variables. Duration of on study time was defined from the date patients went on study to the date they were taken off study. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined from the date on study to date of progression, death in remission, initiation of non-protocol therapy in the absence of progression, or censored on the last visit if patients are still on study. Time to progression (TTP) was defined from the time of on study to the date of progression or censored on the off study date if patients had stopped the study. Patients still on study at the time of manuscript preparation were censored at the last visit date. OS was defined from the date on study to date of death or censored on the last visit if patients were still alive as the time of analysis. The method of Kaplan-Meier was used to summarize duration of on study, time to progression, time to treatment failure, and overall survival from the date of on study. In order to identify the differences between gene expression levels of pre and post treatment genes among patients 2 and 3, we first normalized the data at median, then specified the two comparison groups. The threshold of coefficient variation (standard deviation/mean) was set at 1 and 1000 for lower and upper limit as filtering criteria and gene probes differentially expressed at a level of significance (p<.05) were identified. Among the 15 patients enrolled between January 2007 and June 2008 (Table 1), there were 10 male and 5 female subjects with a median age of 59 years (40-78 years). Most were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and had advanced stage disease (7 with Rai stage 3 or 4). All patients had previously received fludarabine, and 5 patients were refractory. Pretreatment bone marrow biopsies demonstrated extensive infiltration (50-95% replacement) with CLL cells in 14 of the 15 patients. By cytogenetic/FISH analysis, there were 3 patients with del(17p), 5 patients with del(11q), and an additional patient with both del(17p) and del(11q). ZAP-70 expression was analyzed in all patients, and 10 patients were classified as positive with >50% expression, while the other 5 patients demonstrated low ZAP-70 expression. ',\n"," 'All 15 treated patients were evaluable for toxicity, and hematological toxicities were frequently encountered (Table 2). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (ANC <1,000/ul) occurred in 10 patients. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (NCI-WG criteria) occurred in 6 patients, but there were no bleeding events reported. Overall, myelosuppression was quite variable among the 15 patients, and 5 were removed from study within 4 months due to this toxicity rather than progression of disease. Two grade 3 infections were observed, both pneumonias that resolved with supportive care, and there were no grade 4 or 5 infections. The other most common non-hematologic toxicities encountered were nausea and fatigue, primarily grades 1 and 2 (Table 2). Four patients developed pleural effusions, which were transient and easily managed by holding the dasatinib and/or using diuretics and steroids. One patient had grade 4 cardiac toxicity due to an asymptomatic QTc of 516 ms, which resolved with repletion of potassium and magnesium. The one grade 4 renal toxicity was a serum potassium of 9.9 mmol/L that was spurious due to leukocytosis, as has been previously reported. For 11 of the 15 patients, study drug was interrupted at some point due to toxicity, with a median duration of interruption of 1.5 weeks with a range of 0 to 8 weeks. Partial responses (PR) by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI 6-44%). Among the 15 patients, 9 (60%) had nodal responses (2 CR and 7 PR) by physical exam (PE), 5 without a 50% reduction in lymphocytosis (see complete table provided as supplemental data). CT scans confirmed a 50% reduction of all nodal and extranodal masses in 4 of the patients (Figure 1), with the other 5 showing less than 50% reduction. The 4 patients with 50% reduction in blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) also had at least 50% nodal responses, but 1 of these patients had severe myelosuppression such that the response could not be counted as a partial response by NCI-WG criteria. The blood responses tended to show both patterns of early and late improvement in lymphocytosis, with response within 7 days in one patient and ongoing improvement after 6 months in others (data not shown). The median duration on study was 14 weeks. ',\n"," 'Ten patients came off study prior to 12 months, 3 of these with progression and 4 due to toxicity, while 3 withdrew consent without progression or significant toxicity. At 12 months, 5 patients remained on study with one starting to progress but the other 4 continuing on treatment in response or with stable disease. The median TTF was 6.7 months. A total of 14 patients experienced treatment failure. Of the 14 patients, 10 of them had disease progression and 4 of them initiated new treatment without progression of disease. The median time to disease progression was 7.5 months. A total of 10 patients experienced disease progression and the rest were censored on the date off study (Figure 2). The median OS of all patients is 27 months. Of the 15 patients, 9 of them have died. Analysis of ALC and lymph node responses showed that for the 5 patients with del(11q), 3 had a blood response and 5 had a nodal response. In fact, two of the three patients achieving NCI WG PR had del(11q). One of the 5 patients with del(17p) responded in lymph nodes but not in blood. Analysis of response by ZAP-70 status showed no clear pattern. Among the 10 ZAP-70 positive patients 1 responded in blood and 5 responded in lymph nodes. One of the 3 patients to respond according to NCI-WG responses was ZAP-70 positive. The pharmacokinetics of dasatinib varied widely among the 3 patients tested, with the 3-hour level in plasma ranging from 19 to 112 ng/ml (see table provided as supplemental data). As expected given the five hour half-life of dasatinib, the 6-hour levels were far below the 3-hour levels, and the 24-hour trough levels were almost undetectable in all three patients. Using staining for TUNEL and activated caspase 3, apoptosis was seen in all three patients assessed, with maximal apoptosis 6 hours after dasatinib (Figure 3, and data not shown for caspase 3). While patient 1 had modest apoptosis, apoptosis was dramatic in 15-20% of enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients 2 and 3. Also within these three patients, we utilized Elisa to determine if levels of Lyn, p-Lyn, Syk, and p-Syk varied in the hours after taking dasatinib. Patients 1 and 3 had relatively low levels of p-Lyn relative to patient 2 prior to dasatinib (Figure 4). ',\n"," 'While levels of p-Lyn remained low in patients 1 and 3, the elevated p-Lyn in patient 2 decreased dramatically after dasatinib. Conversely, p-Syk levels, which were similar in all three patients prior to dosing, increased in patients 1 and 3 and slightly decreased in patient 2 following dasatinib. Of note, patient 2 had a partial response, while patients 1 and 3 did not experience clinical responses (see the associated ALC response at Day 8 provided at the bottom of Figure 4). Finally, the levels of Lyn kinase, p-Lyn, Syk, and p-Syk were compared at baseline and Day 8 of therapy. No association of baseline levels, or change between baseline and Day 8 levels, was seen with clinical response (data not shown). In order to gain biologic insight into whether a dasatinib-induced change in transcriptional program was associated with the brisk apoptosis seen in patients 2 and 3, microarray gene expression profiling was conducted in EPBLs (enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes) and the expression of genes compared in samples obtained before and 6 hours after taking dasatinib. We identified 123 probe sets, corresponding with 106 genes, which were differentially expressed. Of these,102 probe sets were significantly downregulated and 16 probe sets were significantly upregulated in EPBLs 6 hours after taking dasatinib. Functional annotation analysis of genes was performed using the interface DAVID of the National Institutes of Health. The 102 probe sets which were downregulated corresponded to 92 genes. Within the categories of lymphocyte activation/differentiation and leukocyte activation, the genes spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), FK506 binding protein, early growth response 1 (EGR1), NLR family CARD 3, and Notch 2 were significantly (p < .05) downregulated (gene array provided as a supplemental figure). The 16 upregulated probe sets corresponded to 14 unique genes. Among these, the genes GNAS1 and NFKB2 were significantly (p < .05) upregulated (gene array provided as a supplemental figure). Here we report the first full study of dasatinib in CLL, although a case report has recently been published that shows a complete response in a patient treated with single-agent dasatinb. This phase 2 study of single-agent dasatinib in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL demonstrated 3 partial responses by NCI-WG criteria among 15 patients treated. Overall 9 patients had shrinkage of lymph nodes or extranodal masses to less than 50% of their original size, and 4 patients had reduction of ALC by >50%. ',\n"," 'Dasatinib clearly has activity in relapsed CLL/SLL, and responses occurred in subgroups with poor prognostic indicators, particularly those with del(11q). Less activity was observed in patients with del(17p), and although 75% of patients were ZAP-70 positive, only 1 in 3 responders was ZAP-70 positive, suggesting that activity may be better in ZAP-70 negative patients. The small numbers in these subgroups make conclusions difficult, and subsequent studies with greater numbers of patients should reveal any true associations. Dasatinib was reasonably well tolerated in this group of patients. The toxicity most frequently encountered was myelosuppression, with 10 patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred, but bleeding was not a problem, and both myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia resolved promptly after holding the drug. A lower dose of dasatinib or intermittent dosing might reduce the myelosuppression observed. Two patients did require treatment for grade 3 infections but these were easily managed and not unexpected given the patient population. The only other notable toxicities were nausea, pleural effusions, and fatigue. The nausea could be treated with anti-emetics, and the pleural effusions resolved with dose interruptions, diuretics, and steroids. The fatigue generally was mild and tolerable. The greater activity of dasatinib in lymph nodes was not expected but welcome, since patients with advanced refractory disease often have significant lymphadenopathy and few treatment options. The reason for this increased activity in nodes is unclear but several possible explanations exist. Dasatinib may preferentially target proliferating CLL cells which are characteristically found in lymph nodes compared to blood. Another possible explanation is that dasatinib interferes with stromal support of CLL cells in lymph nodes. The mechanisms of stromal support in CLL are complex and multifactorial. For example, it has been established that B-cell survival is enhanced by CD40 signaling. CD40 is a transmembrane receptor that interacts with CD40 ligand present on CD4+ lymphocytes in lymph nodes, and this interaction results in the activation of PI3K and PLCgamma2 followed by the up-regulation of NF-KB and other anti-apoptotic mediators such as survivin, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The intracellular mediator of CD40 signaling is Lyn kinase, and it may be that the inhibition of Lyn by dasatinib interrupts this pathway of stromal support. ',\n"," 'More compelling is a report of an in vitro model which mimics nodal biology, where CD40 stimulation results in relative resistance to chemotherapy agents such as fludarabine through up-regulation in CLL cells of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1, all anti-apoptotic proteins. In this model, exposure to dasatinib completely prevented the entire anti-apoptotic program and rendered the CLL cells sensitive to fludarabine despite concurrent CD40 stimulation. Hence, dasatinib inhibition of Lyn may be particularly important in lymph node biology, and may show greater activity as a chemotherapy sensitizer in combination therapy. To date, the testing of dasatinib in combination with other drugs in CLL has only been performed in vitro, but these reports have been favorable. In one report, CLL cells from patients were treated in vitro with dasatinib, fludarabine, or in combination. Whereas modest apoptosis was seen with each agent alone, combination treatment with both agents enhanced apoptosis by 50%. Dasatinib led to global inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation with down regulation of Akt, ERK1 or 2, MAPK, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and p38. A similar result was demonstrated in a second report, which showed that CLL cells resistant to fludarabine or chlorambucil become sensitive to these agents when also exposed to dasatinib. It seems apparent that, while dasatinib alone may not consistently initiate apoptosis in all CLL cells, the drug clearly inhibits survival pathways that become critical for CLL cells after attack by more conventional chemotherapy agents. The current trial was originally based on the understanding that dasatinib, at concentrations achievable in humans, inhibits Lyn kinase which is overexpressed in CLL and mediates signal transduction from the BCR to downstream effector molecules. To understand the activity of dasatinib further, we investigated levels of p-Lyn and p-Syk and the subsequent apoptosis of EPBLs in a subset of our patients. We were able to demonstrate among 3 patients studied, that one patient had constitutive Lyn phosphorylation that decreased after dasatinib, while the other two patients showed minimal change in levels of p-Lyn. In the patient in whom Lyn was inhibited, no p-Syk was seen and a clinical PR was observed. The other two patients, both of whom showed increased p-Syk following dasatinib dosing, did not show clinical responses. These results are consistent with a recent report that CLL cells exposed to dasatinib in vitro demonstrate widespread p-Lyn inhibition but undergo apoptosis only when p-Syk and PLCgamma2 are also inhibited. ',\n"," \"Interestingly, we identified changes in the transcriptional program of EPBLs associated with apoptosis after dasatinib exposure. Among the genes that underwent downregulation were SYK, which is implicated in lymphocyte signaling and survival and for which inhibitors are currently under clinical study in CLL, FK506BP, which modulates the apoptotic signal of TGF-beta in CLL, EGR1, whose expression is associated with survival in CLL, NLR Card 3, which is downregulated 6 hrs following T-lymphocyte stimulation, and Notch 2, which similarly undergoes downregulation in CLL cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, genes which were upregulated included GNAS1, whose T393C polymorphism has been correlated with prognosis in CLL in one study but not in another. Also, NFKB2, which upregulates the anti-apoptotic bcl-2, was upregulated following exposure to dasatinib and may indicate the cell's molecular attempt to evade apoptosis. Our in vitro results can only be considered suggestive, and further studies need to be done to clarify the relationships between apoptosis and the various signaling molecules. In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this study that dasatinib has single agent activity in relapsed and refractory CLL, particularly in lymph nodes and in high-risk del(11q) patients. Given this encouraging clinical data as well as reports of in vitro studies providing evidence for greater efficacy in combination with other agents, our future studies of dasatinib in CLL are focusing on combination therapy. This is the first completed clinical trial testing the effectiveness of dasatinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We chose to test dasatinib in CLL because pharmacodynamic evaluation of this agent has demonstrated inhibition of Lyn kinase at very low nanomolar concentrations, and Lyn kinase has been shown to be a key enzyme in CLL survival. Recent in vitro studies have confirmed that dasatinib inhibits proliferation and triggers apoptosis in CLL cells. Our trial demonstrates responses according to strict NCI-WG criteria in 3 of 15 treated patients, which indicates effectiveness in this population of patients. We also report in vitro evidence that dasatinib inhibits phosphorylation of Lyn kinase with subsequent inhibition of Syk kinase associated with apoptosis at 6 hours, suggesting the mechanism of action. \",\n"," 'CALGB conducted a Phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with allogeneic transplantation to treat patients with recurrent low grade B cell malignancies. Patients over age 18 with a diagnosis of relapsed, chemotherapy-sensitive disease underwent transplantation with a matched sibling donor and conditioning with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2/d x 3) and fludarabine phosphate (25 mg/m2/d x 5). GVH prophylaxis included cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus low-dose methotrexate. Forty-four evaluable patients with a median age of 53 and median of two prior regimens were accrued. Sixteen patients had follicular NHL and 28 had histologies including 7 indolent B cell lymphomas, 4 mantle cell, 15 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 2 prolymphocytic leukemia pts. The six-month treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 2.4% and three-year TRM was 9%. Three-year event-free and overall survival were.75 and .81 for the follicular patients, .59 and .71 for the CLL/PLL patients, and .55 and .64 for the other histologies. The incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) was 29% and extensive chronic GVHD was 18%. This report demonstrates that allogeneic sibling transplantation with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen is safe and efficacious for patients with advanced indolent B cell malignancies enrolled on a Cooperative Group study. The treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) has traditionally been associated with high response rates, but a generally accepted inability to induce durable remissions and cure in the vast majority of patients with advanced disease. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) share similar characteristics as treatable but incurable malignancies with conventional approaches. Mantle cell lymphoma is a more aggressive malignancy that has recently demonstrated sensitivity and durable remissions following high dose therapy with intensive chemotherapy regimens and transplantation. These approaches have produced encouraging results in this disease and demonstrate improved progression-free and overall survival compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens plus the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab when used as a component of initial therapy. As with its use in mantle cell lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to conventional regimens for indolent lymphomas or CLL has increased the response rate and disease-free survival in these diseases. The addition of rituximab also led to an improvement in overall survival when it was included as a component of salvage therapy in one large study. ',\n"," 'Additional treatments such as 131Iodine tositumomab or 90Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan labeled anti-CD20 bound isotopes are also effective, but not necessarily more so than employing maintenance therapy with unlabelled anti-CD20 antibodies Although these improvements have been gratifying for patients afflicted with these malignancies, eventual progression to refractory disease and death remains a problem. Over the past 20 years, reports have emerged of the value of high-dose therapy with transplantation in treating these illnesses. Early studies with autologous transplants were especially encouraging when the infused marrow product was rendered tumor free by pcr analysis after ex vivo purging with anti-CD20 antibodies. Concerns remain about the risk of late complications such as the emergence of myelodysplasia or acute leukemia in patients treated with this approach and for a number of years, such treatment had fallen out of favor. Recent data has suggested that the use of antibody-mediated in vivo tumor cell purging might be lead to long remissions and possible cure without the high risk of treatment related complications associated with allogeneic transplants, but the durability of these responses and the long term risks of secondary malignancies remain uncertain. Data has emerged from both registry and large single institution studies that allogeneic donor transplants, whether with an ablative or non-ablative approach can be associated with prolonged remission and apparent cure for low-grade NHL patients. Reduced intensity regimens have demonstrated low morbidity and mortality rates associated with these approaches even after relapse following an autologous transplant. As a result of these encouraging single-institution results, CALGB undertook a prospective multi-center trial for patients with relapsed low-grade or mantle cell lymphoma, CLL, PLL, or SLL using matched related donors and a reducedintensity regimen. The current report describes the results of this Phase II study with a single conditioning regimen, GVHD prevention, and supportive care strategy. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate a six-month treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of less than 30% in a multi-center trial for patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL and PLL. The secondary objectives of the trial were to measure the response rates at six and 12 months post-transplant, the event-free and overall survival of this study population and assess the development of the total and T cell chimerism rates in the peripheral blood and marrow at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days. ',\n"," 'the cumulative risk of acute and chronic graft vs host disease, and identifying other treatment-related toxicities such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome and duration of cytopenias. Classical definitions of GVHD were used including a designation of chronic GVHD as that which occurred after day 100. All patients were < 70 years of age, had histologically documented chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or mantle cell lymphoma as follows. Diagnosis of CLL was made according to the NCI 1996 criteria. Histologic documentation of CLL or PLL required a lymphocytosis > 5,000/microl with < 55% prolymphocytes for CLL; patients with >= 55% prolymphocytes were classified as PLL. Histologic documentation of low-grade NHL was made according to the REAL Subtypes: small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular center lymphoma (grade I or II), diffuse predominantly small cell type, or marginal zone B-cell. Patients must have failed at least one prior regimen or have >=3 of the IPI risk factors; age > 60; PS>1; LDH>normal; presence of > 1 site of extra-nodal disease; or stage III/IV disease. Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma required histologic documentation with at least one of the following: immunophenotype with expression of CD5 and CD19 without CD23; cytogenetic analysis with presence of t(11;14); over-expression of cyclin D1, or bcl1 re-arrangement. All patients had stable or responsive disease to their most recent treatment and were >= 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Patients may not have received a prior autologous transplant and not have symptomatic pulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or serious infection. All patients had a matched sibling donor by low-resolution typing at HLA A, B, DR. All patients were staged with a physical exam, CT or PET/CT scan, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and organ function testing. Laboratory values included granulocytes >= 500/microL, platelets, >= 50,000/microL, calculated creatinine clearance, >= 40 cc/min, total bilirubin, <= 3 x ULN, AST, <= 3 x ULN, negative u-HCG or serum HCG if of child-bearing potential, DLCO > 40% and LVEF > 30%. Each participant signed an IRB-approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. Fludarabine was given at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day on Days -7 through -3. Cyclophosphamide was given at a dose of 1 g/m2/day IV on days -5 through -3. ',\n"," 'A target goal of 5-8 x 106 matched sibling donor peripheral blood CD34+ cells were collected following four or five days of G-CSF administration at 10 ug/kg/d on days -5 to -2 or -1, and infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus on day -1 with tapering begun on Day +90 as tolerated with a goal of stopping by Day +150. The rate of taper was adjusted for the presence of signs and symptoms of GVHD. Tacrolimus was tapered more quickly (Day +60 to Day +90) if donor chimerism of CD3 cells was < 50% at Day +60 or if disease progression occurred. A competing risks model was used to simultaneously estimate the probabilities of acute or chronic GVHD and death. A similar competing risks model was used to simultaneously estimate the probabilities of acute GVHD and death. Patients with progressive disease and no evidence of GVHD were tapered off tacrolimus at the time progressive or stable disease was noted. If there was no evidence of active GVHD, then donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given no sooner than 30 days after complete cessation of GVHD prophylaxis treatment. The initial dose of DLI was 1 x 107 CD3 cells/kg. Subsequent doses of DLI could be given at intervals of no less than 30 days in the absence of response or GVHD with doses of 5 x 107 CD3 cells/kg. Antibiotic Prophylaxis consisted of fluconazole, acyclovir, and TMP/SMX per institutional standards. CMV monitoring and therapy were based on positive cultures or pcr testing. G-CSF was administered at a dose of 5 ug/kg/day from day +5 until an ANC of >1000/ul was achieved for 3 consecutive days. Study monitoring, data quality and statistical evaluation were undertaken by the CALGB Statistical and Data Management Centers. The primary endpoint of the study was treatment-related mortality within six months of the day of stem cell infusion (Day 0). The primary hypothesis was that the probability of experiencing a TRM was less than 30%. The null hypothesis, H0, that the TRM rate, p. is less than or equal to .15 (H0: p <0.15) was compared with the alternative hypothesis, HA, that p is greater than or equal to 0.30 (HA: p> 0.30). ',\n"," 'TRM was assessed at three stages with 15 patients accrued per stage and a maximum of 45 patients entered onto the study as long as the stopping criteria for the study were not met. The significance level and power of this design were 0.08 and 0.85, respectively. The time to event distributions for overall and event-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method while the discrepancy between two time to event distributions was tested using the log-rank test. Donor chimerism in peripheral blood as well as CD19, CD3, and CD14/15 selected cells were determined using a pcr-based method that routinely achieved 1% sensitivity. CD19, CD3, and CD14/15 cells were selected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Miltenyi magnetic particles (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of each cell subset was determined by flow cytometry. Two short tandem repeat (STR) loci were amplified for each donor-recipient pair (selected from VWF, D21S11, D18S51, D16S539, PENTA D, D3S1358, FGA, D7S820, D2S1338, D10S2325, D12S391, SE33, PENTA E). Amplicons were separated using an automated nucleotide sequencer (ABI 3100 Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the quantity of each informative allele from duplicate samples was determined using GeneMapper fragment analysis software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Forty-seven patients from 13 different CALGB transplant centers were registered onto this study (Table 1). Three patients never began therapy and will not be included in this analysis of 44 patients who were treated per protocol between August, 2001 and April, 2006. Histologies included 16 follicular, 7 other indolent B cell disease, 4 mantle cell, 15 CLL and 2 PLL pts. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 2.5 years (range 0.4 to 12.4 years). The median number of prior therapies was 3 for the entire group (range 1-6) including a median of 3 for those patients with CLL/PLL or Mantle Cell/Other histologies and 2 prior therapies for the 16 patients with follicular NHL. Four patients had received prior irradiation and 1 of 27 NHL patients had an ECOG performance status greater than 1. Forty-one percent of NHL patients had > 1 site of extra-nodal disease. The majority of patients had either a short duration of initial remission, young age, high-risk disease, or were transplanted following multiple therapies. Overall 6-month treatment-related mortality was 2.3% (1 subject) at day 117 from GVHD and sepsis indicating strong statistical evidence in support of the study hypothesis (Table 2). ',\n"," 'Three additional patients died of non-relapse causes at 18, 19, and 36 months from GVHD and sepsis for a three-year treatment-related mortality rate of 9%. One additional patient died of fungal pneumonia in conjunction with treatment for chronic GVHD 7 years following transplant, while another died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma for an overall non-relapse mortality of 13.6% after a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Twenty-five percent (11/44) of patients experienced grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities, primarily from infection or GVHD. Additional serious toxicities included one pulmonary embolus, one grade 4 sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, and two second malignancies; one of the pancreas and a second of the distal esophagus. The median duration of an ANC < 1000/ul was 8 days (range 0-19) and thrombocytopenia < 100,000/ul was 12 days (range 0-38). Twenty-seven of the 44 patients required no platelet transfusions. The median number of red cell transfusions during the transplant period was 1 (range 0-9) with 13 patients requiring no RBC transfusions. Infectious complications were documented in 67% of patients; viral infections in 32%, including CMV reactivation in 15% of patients and CMV infection in 2 patients, bacterial in 41% and fungal in 20% of patients (more than one type of infection was seen in multiple patients). An additional 30% of patients had site-specific infections for which no organism was identified. As described in Table 3, the median % of peripheral blood donor T-cell chimerism at days 30, 60 and 180 were 88, 94, and 97% respectively. Comparable values for unfractionated (lymphoid + myeloid population) peripheral blood chimerism at days 30, 60, and 180 were 80, 85, and 99% respectively. While these median values were high, a significant percentage of patients demonstrated a persistent mixed chimerism picture out to day 180. Greater than 90% peripheral blood donor T cells was seen in 45, 61, and 64% of patients at days 30, 60, and 180 post-transplant. Likewise, > 90% unfractionated peripheral blood donor chimerism was seen in 26, 36, and 65% of patients at days 30, 60, and 180 respectively. (Table 3) Thus, if full donor chimerism was defined as > 90% donor cells, then 64 and 65% of patients showed full donor engraftment in the unfractionated and lymphoid compartments respectively by six months. Bone marrow and peripheral blood gave similar chimerism results at each time point. Finally, no correlation was observed between chimerism status and relapse. ',\n"," 'The overall incidence of grades 1-4 acute GVHD was 61% of which 11% was grade 2, 16% grade 3, and 2.3% grade 4. Twenty-nine point three (29.3) percent of patients experienced limited and 18% had extensive chronic GVHD. Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as time to progression or death due to any cause (Table 4). There have been 18 events. Twelve patients have relapsed at 3 (3 pts), 4 (1 pt), 6 (2 pts), 9(1 pt) 15 (2 pts), 20 (1 pt), 29 (1pt) and 45 (1 pt) months post transplant. The other 6 events were deaths in the absence of relapse due to GVHD (2), sepsis (2), fungal pneumonia in the setting of chronic GVHD (1) and adenocarcinoma (1). While most patients with lymphoma achieved optimal response within the first three months post-transplant, the CLL/PLL cohort demonstrated a slower pace of response with the median time to CR being 3.5 months, but one patient reported as requirig 9 months and another 22 months post-transplant. Six of 17 patients with CLL/PLL, 3/16 with follicular and 3/11 patients with other indolent B cell malignancies have relapsed. Four patients received DLI for progressive disease and subsequently died of their malignancy. The other relapsed patients were felt to be ineligible for DLI either because of uncontrollable relapse or pre-existing GVHD. One additional patient received DLI for a stable partial response and one for loss of chimerism. Both remain in complete remission more than four years post transplant. For the 30 patients still alive, the median follow-up is 4.6 years. The EFS at 3 years for follicular patients was 0.75 (.46-.90), compared to 0.59 (.33-.78) for CLL/PLL and 0.55 (0.23-.78) for the other and mantle cell histologies combined (Figure 1). Fourteen deaths have occurred from progressive disease (7), infection and GVH (6, one of which occurred following a second transplant for relapsed disease), and a second malignancy (1). Overall survival at 3 years is 0.81 (.51-.93) for the follicular histologies, 0.71 (.43-.87) for CLL/PLL and 0.64 (.30-.85) for the other and mantle cell histologies, respectively (Figure 2). Despite the recent advances in standard therapies, treatment outcomes for patients with indolent B cell malignancies remain suboptimal, as life expectancies are clearly reduced by these diagnoses. ',\n"," 'For those patients who are seeking a cure, stem cell transplantation has been available for many years, although late recurrences and the development of secondary myelodysplasia have undermined the utility of autologous transplants while treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and lack of suitable donors have limited the use of allogeneic transplants. Recently, the use of reduced intensity regimens has markedly reduced early morbidity and mortality following allogeneic transplantation. While early relapse and later complications of chronic graft vs host disease and infection remain a problem, the overall success with these reduced intensity regimens have all indicated a plateau on the survival curves with 4 year or longer disease free remission rates exceeding 60% for chemotherapy-responsive patients. The data from Khouri is especially encouraging with the use of transplant and high-dose rituximab as the progression-free survival (PFS) in that trial exceeded 80% at five years with a very low incidence of acute and chronic GVHD for matched related transplant patients. A treatment regimen including the identical schedule and dosage of rituximab is currently being evaluated in a multi-center trial sponsored by an intergroup collaboration between the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT-CTN), CALGB, ECOG, and SWOG. In the current report, the fact that a multi-center group was able to conduct an allogeneic transplant study that yielded excellent outcomes with only a 2.3% six month TRM was very encouraging. Recent mortality rates from other trials are similar, but at the time the study was planned, there was no Cooperative Group experience with reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant on which to base an expectation of TRM. Morbidity was also low, with an overall incidence of grade IV non-hematologic toxicities of 25% including an 11% incidence of pulmonary complications that consisted of pneumonitis, infection, and alveolar hemorrhage. Severe hepatic and renal toxicities were rare and the overall incidence of infections included 5% CMV infection and 15% reactivation, 41% bacterial, and 20% documented fungal processes. The overall incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD was 29%. Thirty percent of patients had limited and 18% had extensive chronic GVHD. While these numbers are somewhat higher than those reported by groups that have used alemtuzamab as a component of the conditioning regimen, reactivation of CMV is less frequent, and the need for donor lymphocyte infusion for relapse appears lower in the current study. ',\n"," 'At day 30 post-transplant, only 26% of patients demonstrated > 90% unfractionated peripheral blood donor chimerism and 45% demonstrated > 90% T cell donor chimerism. By day 180, the % of patients with > 90% unfractionated and T cell donor chimerism had increased to 65 and 64% respectively. At the same time points, the median percentage of donor T cell chimerism was higher and reached 85 and 94% by day 60, and 99 and 97% by day 180. Thus, while the median % of donor cells is high in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments by day 180, only about 2/3 of patients achieved full donor chimerism in both components of the peripheral blood by as late as 6 months following transplant. If the approach encouraged by Thomsen and colleagueswas followed, this could lead to donor lymphocyte infusions for as many as 1/3 of the patients, even in the absence of disease progression. Peripheral blood and marrow values correlated well with one another. The lack of correlation between relapse and chimerism status may reflect small numbers of patients in our study or alternatively, indicate that partial chimerism may in fact be sufficient to maintain an anti-tumor effect while associated with a low rate of long term GVHD in most patients. Our results are somewhat different from the report by Thomson where relapse was lower in those patients who converted from partial to full donor chimerism after DLI infusions compared to those who remained with a mixed chimerism status despite DLI. They also reported a higher remission and durable remission rate in those relapsed patients who received DLI than we observed, perhaps due to earlier intervention at a time of less advanced disease. Alterations in the immunosuppression regimens used or early infusion of DLI might enhance the rate and frequency of full donor chimerism, but one would expect this to be associated with an increased rate and severity of GVHD. Despite these concerns, the Thomson results were excellent, with 76% of patients remaining progression-free at four years with only 18% having extensive chronic GVHD. There were 14 deaths reported to date in the CALGB study including nine in patients who had relapsed and required additional therapy. One patient died from a pancreatic cancer, 2 years post transplant. Five patients died of infection related to GVHD at 4, 18, 19, 36, and 72 months post transplant. ',\n"," 'Significant challenges remain to the successful application of this approach. While the use of well-matched unrelated donors has not had a negative impact in recent reports of transplant studies for acute leukemia, data on approaches using such donors in low-grade malignancies is just emerging. Recent reports by the EBMT and CIBMTR have indicated that while use of unrelated donors resulted in a somewhat higher incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, the overall rates of progression, morbidity, and mortality compare favorably to outcomes following fully-ablative transplants. It is notable, however, that the recent paper by Thomson reported higher rates of progression-free survival in their matched related than unrelated patients, even with a reduced intensity regimen. While 53 is relatively old for allogeneic transplants, it is young for low grade NHL and CLL populations and in future trials, one would anticipate an even higher median age and likely a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Whether the relapse rate could be reduced further by more intensive therapy remains a question to be considered given the high rate of toxicity and low success rate associated with frank relapse followed by DLI in the current study. Of the six patients who received DLI, four died from progressive disease despite the onset of significant GVHD while the two patients infused with DLI for loss of chimerism and stable partial remission remain in CR more than two years beyond DLI infusion. This suggests that careful monitoring for relapse and early use of DLI may be a more effective strategy than delaying such efforts until frank recurrence is observed. Although the number of enrolled patients with low-grade NHL or CLL are less than in the Khouri or Thomson trials, our results are remarkably similar, especially for the follicular lymphoma patients. Even in more aggressive diseases such as prolymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma, there appears to be a plateau on the event-free survival curves, albeit with median follow-up that remains less than four years. While the number of patients is small, we have only had one patient relapse beyond 2 years in this study, suggesting that most responses will be durable. This is consistent with the results published by the M.D. ',\n"," 'Anderson group in which non-ablative allogeneic transplant appeared to confer a higher likelihood of prolonged disease-free survival in mantle cell patients, especially in those with relapsed or refractory disease, compared to what had been achieved with autologous transplantation. Also of note is the prolonged time to best response that can be seen in these patients, particularly those with CLL. This likely reflects in part the slow time to establishing full donor chimerism which is associated with the graft vs leukemia effect that is known to occur in these patients but which can take months to develop. Our results testify not only to the efficacy of this approach, but confirm that this treatment can be undertaken safely and effectively in a large number of transplant-centers by following rigorous protocols. ',\n"," 'Acadesine has shown in vitro to selectively induce apoptosis in B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. We conducted a phase I/II open-label clinical study, to determine the safety and tolerability of acadesine given intravenously as a 4-h infusion to CLL patients. Patient population included CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease who had received one or more prior lines of treatment including either a fludarabine or an alkylator-based regimen. Twenty-four patients were included: eighteen in Part I treated at single doses of 50-315 mg/kg, and six in Part II, three with two doses at 210 mg/kg and three with five doses at 210 mg/kg. A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg; 210 mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal biological dose (OBD). Grade >=2 hyperuricemia occurred commonly but was not clinically significant and resolved with the administration of prophylactic allopurinol. Other adverse events included transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia (not clinically significant), renal impairment, and transient infusion-related hypotension (clinically significant). Trends of efficacy such as a reduction of peripheral CLL cells and reduction in lymphadenopathy were observed; however, the results were variable due to the small population and the range of doses tested. A MTD of 210 mg/kg was established with single acadesine dose. Multiple dose administrations at the OBD were tested with an acceptable safety profile, showing that acadesine might be a valuable agent for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent type of leukemia in the Western world, affecting mainly the elderly. CLL follows an extremely variable clinical course, with overall survival times ranging from months to decades. The symptoms and signs of the disease arise from a clonal excess of B cells caused mainly by defects that prevent programmed cell death (apoptosis). Available treatments for CLL generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse and CLL remains an incurable disease. Fludarabine-based regimens have significantly improved the efficacy of CLL treatment, and recently, a large randomized trial showed that the addition of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in treatment-naive patients (as first-line therapy) and PFS in relapsed patients. However, current chemotherapy is not selective for CLL cells, and attendant T-cell apoptosis leads to adverse reactions, including severe and prolonged immunosuppression. ',\n"," \"Conventional treatment of CLL is also associated with temporary myelosuppression with a concomitant increased risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding/bruising. Almost all patients relapse or become resistant to existing therapies, especially those with genomic alterations such as deletion 17p and/or mutations in TP53. Both have been shown to predict for poor response to chemotherapy and to be associated with poor OS. Acadesine (Acadra ), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-d-ribofuranoside or AICA-riboside, is a water soluble nucleoside with a different mechanism of action compared to currently approved nucleoside analogs (e.g., fludarabine). When added to cell cultures or administered to animals or humans, acadesine is phosphorylated to its ribotide, AICA-ribotide (ZMP). ZMP is a natural endogenous intermediate in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Acadesine induces apoptosis of CLL cells cultured ex vivo in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range 50 muM to 1 mM, and with an IC50 of 380 +- 60 muM. Incorporation of acadesine into the cell and its subsequent phosphorylation to ZMP are necessary to induce apoptosis. Moreover, acadesine is not reliant on the p53 tumor suppressor or ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) proteins to drive apoptosis, and hence, the absence/loss of function of these proteins in patients with CLL should not affect the activity of acadesine. This is an important issue because alterations of either p53 or ATM are related to resistance to chemotherapy in CLL. Also, no significant differences in acadesine-induced apoptosis have been observed in ex vivo analysis between unmutated and mutated CLL samples and either between ZAP70 positive and ZAP70 negative cases. Ex vivo, B cells were found to be much more sensitive to acadesine-induced apoptosis than T cells. Given that fludarabine causes both B- and T-cell apoptosis, the latter leading to the common and severe complication of immunosuppression, the B cell targeted mode of action of acadesine could provide a safety benefit over other commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens and a valuable treatment alternative to certain groups of patients with CLL who are refractory to other treatments. This phase I/II study was approved by the competent institutional review board and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00559624). A total of 24 patients were enrolled in the study. All of them provided written informed consent, prior to any study related procedure not part of the patient's normal medical care. \",\n"," \"part of the patient's normal medical care. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of CLL according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group Criteria, with refractory or relapsed disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status <=2, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. They had received one or more prior lines of treatment which must have included either a fludarabine- or cladribine-based regimen or an alkylator-based regimen. Refractoriness was defined as any patient who had failed to achieve a complete response (CR), nodular partial response (nPR), or partial response (PR) according to the NCI Working Group Guidelines for CLL. Fludarabine refractoriness also included patients who achieved a CR, nPR, or PR of <=6 months duration. Other inclusion criteria were adequate renal function, defined by serum creatinine <=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and a calculated creatinine clearance of >=60 mL/min. This was a Phase I/II, open-label, study to evaluate an escalating dose and number of doses of acadesine in patients with CLL. The primary endpoint of the study was to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of acadesine in CLL patients, and the secondary endpoints were to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of acadesine and its metabolite, ZMP, and to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) of acadesine in patients with CLL. OBD for single-dose administration of acadesine was considered as the dose enabling a plasma concentration in the range of that causing apoptosis in in vitro models determined from the PK and safety data, and was defined as the dose below that at which dose escalation is stopped in Part I of the study and this dose will be the starting dose used in Part II of the study which will assess repeat dosing with acadesine. Patients were enrolled in the study in cohorts of three patients or more, depending upon the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Day 1 dosing was staggered between all patients in each cohort by a minimum of 48 h. In Part I, patients received a single dose of acadesine on Day 1. In Part II, patients received up to 5 doses of acadesine over a period of up to 15 days starting on Day 1. The starting dose for Part I was 50 mg/kg given as a 4 h (+-30 min) intravenous (iv) infusion on Day 1 only. \",\n"," 'Patients were assessed for safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) for up to 3 weeks after dosing (to Day 22). Investigators were advised to treat patients with prophylactic allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia in all patients in Part I from Cohort 2 onward; additionally, a specific dose and duration of treatment of allopurinol was specified for Part II. The decision to escalate to the next dose in a separate cohort of patients was based on the assessment of safety, including any DLTs, PK modeling of exposure to ZMP, and PD response data, where available, by the independent Data Monitoring Board (DMB). Dose escalation in Part I of the study followed a modified Fibonacci dose escalation design, with 100 % dose escalations allowed until a confirmed grade 2 toxicity (as defined by NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 for all toxicities except anemia and thrombocytopenia where CTCAE version 2.0 adapted for leukemia studies was used) considered related to treatment occurred. Once this occurred, future dose escalations were incremental (67, 50, 40, 33 %, etc.). In Part II, patients were treated with 2 or 5 consecutive doses at the MTD/OBD identified in Part I of the study. Incidence, causality, and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), local tolerability, changes in laboratory values (including liver enzymes, blood glucose and uric acid) and vital signs were assessed. They were assessed for their relationship to acadesine and classified for severity according to the CTCAE v3.0 for all events except anemia and thrombocytopenia which were assessed according to CTCAE v2.0 (which uses % changes relative to study baseline/entry). In Part I of the study, blood samples for PK analysis (for both acadesine and its metabolite ZMP) were taken pre-dose and 0, 30, 60 min, 2, 6, 20, 72, 96, and 168 h, 14 and 21 days post-dose in all cohorts. In Part II, PK samples were also taken at pre-dose and 0 min and 20 h post-dose for any interim doses, and 72, 96, and 168 h and 14 and 21 days after completion of the last dose for each patient. Acadesine and ZMP concentrations were determined by a validated bioanalytical HPLC-MS/MS method, with lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) set at 20 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL for acadesine in human plasma and ZMP in whole blood, respectively. ',\n"," 'A noncompartmental PK analysis of the acadesine and ZMP concentrations was undertaken using the WinNonlin software, Professional Version 5.3 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Although no International Working Group (IWG) disease response assessments were included in the protocol, bi-dimensional nodal area (sum of right neck, left neck, right axillary, left axillary, right inguinal and left inguinal nodes) and uni-dimensional lymph nodes (liver and spleen length) were measured. The PD effect of acadesine in patients with CLL was assessed by B-cell and T-cell counts in peripheral blood. Samples were taken at pre-dose and 20, 72, 168 h, and 21 days post-dose in all cohorts. In Part II, PD samples were also taken at pre-dose and 20 h post-dose for any interim doses, and 72, 168 h and 21 days after completion of the last dose for each patient. From January 2008 to January 2011, 24 CLL patients with refractory or relapsed disease were enrolled onto this phase I/II clinical trial. The pretreatment characteristics are listed in Table 1. Patients were between 56 and 79 years old, all diagnosed with CLL between 4 and 21 years (inclusive) prior to study entry. The majority were males (15 patients, 63 %) and had received between 1 and 13 previous lines of therapy (mean 2.7). All patients had an ECOG score of <=2 and had received either a fludarabine- or cladribine-based regimen or an alkylator-based regimen, in accordance with the eligibility criteria. Individual Rai and Binet staging and relapsed/refractory status at screening are displayed in Table 2. In Part I of the study, patients received a single dose of acadesine on Day 1 at escalating doses: 50 mg/kg (6 patients), 83.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 139.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 210 mg/kg (3 patients), and 315 mg/kg (3 patients). At the 315 mg/kg dose level, 2 of the 3 patients experienced a DLT. Also, PK data indicate that at 315 mg/kg, a plateau in acadesine conversion to ZMP was reached. Therefore, 210 mg/kg was designated per protocol MTD and OBD for single acadesine administration based on the decision of the DMB. The dose administered in Part II (210 mg/kg) was based on the results of Part I. ',\n"," 'In view of the possible risk of acadesine-related renal adverse events or laboratory evidence of creatinine elevation, either as part of a clinical tumor lysis syndrome or occurring as isolated renal impairment, acadesine in Part II Cohort 1 was to be administered with a minimum of a 72-h interval between each dose. Thus, 3 patients received 2 doses (on Days 1 and 4) and 3 patients received 5 consecutive doses (on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, and 15). Acadesine infusions were well tolerated. No acadesine-related deaths occurred in the study, and no patients withdrew from the study due to AEs (all causality, either related or not related to the study drug), in either the single or repeated dose part of the study. In Part I, a total of 78 AEs were reported in 15 (83 %) patients, and approximately half of all AEs were reported as drug-related (42 AEs, 54 %. See Table 3). Six SAEs were reported in 2 patients in the 50 mg/kg (3 SAEs) and in 2 patients in the 315 mg/kg (3 SAEs) cohorts. In Part II, a total of 48 AEs were reported in 6 patients, over half of all AEs were reported as drug-related (31 AEs, 65 %. See Table 3), and there were no SAEs. Among all study patients, a single CTCAE grade 4 AE was reported (hyperuricemia) and 9 CTCAE grade 3 events (in 6 patients) were reported. In part I of the study, one patient at 50 mg/kg experienced hyperuricemia (CTCAE grade 4, DLT but not reported as an SAE). As a result, prophylactic allopurinol was administered to patients in the higher dose cohorts, and no further hyperuricemia AEs occurred. Two patients, one at 210 mg/kg and one at 315 mg/kg, reported acadesine-related transient hypotension, CTCAE grade 1 and 2, respectively, starting after acadesine infusion and resolved the day after acadesine dosing (Day 2) with no clinical sequelae. Only the patient treated with 315 mg/kg required treatment (a sodium chloride iv infusion) and had concomitant AEs of presyncope (vasovagal syndrome) and nausea, both CTCAE grade 1. In Part I, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs in Part I were anemia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2, reported in 3 patients, all of them with hemoglobin values below the normal range at pre-dose) and diarrhea, reported in 2 patients, of CTCAE grade 1 (see Table 3). ',\n"," 'At 315 mg/kg, 2 out of 3 patients experienced DLTs: the first patient experienced a tumor lysis syndrome (classed as a SAE, CTCAE grade 3), which resolved within 13 days with rasburicase treatment. The second patient, diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma and a large abdominal lymphomatous mass, reported renal impairment/increased creatinine (both reported as SAEs and CTCAE grade 3), which resolved quickly (returning to grade 1 within 14 days) with conservative treatment (no dialysis required). In the repeat dose phase, no SAEs were observed. There was evidence of transient increases in creatinine after dosing in the 5 x 210 mg/kg repeat dose cohort: one DLT was reported in one patient (increased creatinine; CTCAE grade 2) and an AE was reported in another patient (increased creatinine; CTCAE grade 1), both patients having normal creatinine levels at baseline. One patient treated with 2 doses at 210 mg/kg reported acadesine-related hypotension (CTCAE grade 2), which resolved spontaneously within 24 h, without treatment and without clinical sequelae. In Part II, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs during repeat dosing were anemia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2; reported in 5 patients, 4 of them with hemoglobin values below the normal range at pre-dose), thrombocytopenia (CTCAE grade 1 or 2, reported by 2 patients, one of them with platelets pre-dose levels below the normal range), and nausea (reported by 3 patients; CTCAE grade 1 or 2). There was reduction in the size of palpable lymph nodes after single and repeat dosing with acadesine, although it should be noted that formal IWG response criteria assessments were not planned in this phase I/II study. In Part I, 11/18 patients showed evidence of anti-leukemic activity, in terms of decreases in B cells and/or decreases in the size of lymph nodes (decreases >20 % at any time after dosing with respect to pre-dosing values in either B-cell counts or lymph nodes size. See Table 4). In Part II, 5/6 patients showed evidence of anti-leukemic activity according to the same criteria. For example, a patient with Del13q14 and Del17p, treated at 50 mg/kg, experienced a sustained reduction in B-cell counts, which at Day 22 post-treatment was 58 % lower than at baseline. Also, one patient treated with five doses at 210 mg/kg experienced a reduction in B-cell counts up to 65.7 % on Day 8 post-baseline. This patient had lymph nodes involvement and paraneoplastic skin manifestations. ',\n"," 'The lymphocyte count has continued to drop, and 18 months after acadesine treatment, lymphocyte count is below 5,000/muL, and there are no signs of disease in lymph nodes or skin. Although we only had data from 3 patients per cohort (6 in cohort 1), we compared the B- and T-cell mean values at every post-treatment time with values at pre-treatment. Changes in T-cell counts were inconsistent across the cohorts and no overall significant trend was apparent. For B cells, statistically significant decreases occurred at some time points in some cohorts (see Table 4). In cohort 1, decrease in B cells at Day 2 was statistically significant using parametric (p = 0.012, Student t test) or nonparametric (p = 0.043, Wilcoxon signed rank test) method. Similarly, when pre-dose B cells were compared to Day 2 results in all 15 patients from the single-dose cohort where both values are available, a significant difference was found by both statistical methods (p = 0.038 and p = 0.027, respectively). This suggests a trend in decrease in B cells and tends to confirm the results from in vitro experiments, where acadesine induced apoptosis selectively in B cells. Results showed that acadesine and ZMP were rapidly distributed in the bloodstream, and acadesine was rapidly converted into ZMP. Maximum acadesine concentrations were observed at the end of the infusions and from then on concentrations started to decrease. The LLOQ for acadesine was reached between 20 h and 15 days. Maximum concentrations of ZMP were found between the end of the infusion and 30 min-1 h later due to the time elapsed between acadesine administration and its transformation into ZMP. Blood ZMP concentrations started decreasing progressively from 1 h on (after the end of the infusion), reaching the LLOQ between 5 and 22 days after administration (Fig. 1). At the OBD (210 mg/kg single dose), maximum concentration (Cmax) for acadesine was 38,736 ng/mL and 270,988 ng/mL for ZMP (median of the 3 patients treated in the cohort). The Area under the curve (AUC0 24) was 123,124 ng h/mL for acadesine and 2,066,170 ng h/mL for ZMP (median of 3 patients treated in the cohort). ',\n"," 'Considering that the sum of the Cmax molar plasma concentrations of acadesine and ZMP, obtained at the end of the 4-h infusion, would be equivalent to the dose used in an in vitro cell culture, at the OBD dose (210 mg/kg single dose) target acadesine concentrations were achieved (median acadesine + ZMP concentration was 0.9 mM, higher than the 0.5 mM concentrations used to induce apoptosis in in vitro cell cultures)). Time of maximum drug concentration (Tmax), maximum drug concentration (Cmax), area under the time-concentration curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0 24), and half life (t1/2) for all cohorts are summarized in Table 5. The PK analysis of both acadesine and ZMP demonstrates a high degree of inter-subject variability. For both cohorts in Part II, there was no important accumulation of acadesine or ZMP upon multiple dosing. Following single-dose infusion of acadesine, there was a trend toward a plateau in ZMP levels after increasing the acadesine dose from 139.5 to 210 mg/kg. PK data at 315 mg/kg and PK modeling indicate a plateau in acadesine conversion to ZMP. Thus, the OBD determined from the PK and safety data was 210 mg/kg. This study was the first administration of acadesine in cancer patients:specifically CLL. A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for acadesine in patients with CLL at single doses between 50 and 210 mg/kg. The key safety findings with regard to AEs and clinical laboratory results were asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient renal impairment/increased creatinine, and infusion-related hypotension. Hyperuricemia has been documented in previous studies with acadesine administered to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury, and given that acadesine is metabolized to uric acid, hyperuricemia was not unexpected in patients with CLL. Prophylactic allopurinol adopted from cohort 2 (Part I) resulted in no further hyperuricemia occurring in the study. Four patients had renal impairment during the study (two received 315 mg/kg and two 5 x 210 mg/kg). All of them recovered with appropriate management and none of them required dialysis. Two independent nephrologists reviewed data from all patients and conclude that the renal dysfunction associated with acadesine treatment exhibited functional characteristics rather than nephrotoxic features, based on the rapid reversibility and full recovery of the renal dysfunction even after several acadesine consecutive doses. They proposed renal function monitoring and prophylaxis measures that will be implemented in the following clinical trials with acadesine. ',\n"," 'Modest (grade 1 or 2), transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, with recovery to baseline levels occurring in most patients within last days of acadesine administration, were reported in 3/18 and 5/6 patients treated in Part I and Part II of the study, respectively. All but one these AEs were drug-related, and none of them were clinically significant. Acadesine-related transient hypotension occurred in 3 patients in this trial. The hypotension typically occurred after acadesine infusion and lasted several hours with no clinically significant sequellae. Recovery occurred either spontaneously or with conservative (iv fluid administration) management. Of note, there was no evidence of renal toxicity or hypotension in pre-clinical studies or in cardiac studies in more than 2,000 patients who were administered acadesine. This is the first time that the PK of acadesine has been investigated in patients with CLL. The results indicate a high degree of inter-subject variability. Several possible factors may be contributing to this observation, for example: the underlying disease, associated co-morbidities, and co-medication. The OBD, that is, the dose enabling a plasma concentration in the range of that causing apoptosis in in vitro models determined from the PK and safety data, was 210 mg/kg. In terms of disease activity, there were no conventional IWG responses in this study; such assessments were not prospectively planned as is typical in a phase I trial. However, there was evidence of anti-leukemic activity in 16/24 patients based on a more than 20 % reduction in either B-cell count or size of palpable lymph nodes. In vitro anti-leukemic activity independent of genetic alterations has been previously described with acadesine by Pairet and collaborators. Our study size is too small to draw definitive conclusions, but indications of anti-leukemic activity were seen in patients with poor prognosis genetic alterations, suggesting that acadesine might be a potential treatment option in this sub-group. The absence of significant reduction in T-cell counts with acadesine in this study is in agreement with ex vivo data which showed B cells were more sensitive to acadesine-induced apoptosis than T cells. This is in contrast with current chemotherapy agents, such as fludarabine, which cause long-lasting T- and NK-cell depression. Although early indications from this study are that acadesine does not induce T-cell apoptosis to the same extent as existing treatments, larger scale studies will be required to confirm this in the wider population. ',\n"," 'In conclusion, this study has defined the DLT, MTD, and OBD of acadesine and also shows provisional evidence of acadesine anti-leukemic activity, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. Assessment and monitoring of renal function is essential in patients receiving acadesine. The modest myelosuppressive profile observed with acadesine (if confirmed in larger trials) may make it either an attractive combination partner for standard of care agents used in CLL patients or a candidate for post-induction intervention. The p53-independent mechanism of action of acadesine makes it an attractive compound in patients bearing alterations of this pathway, which represent a significant group in advanced patients, and for whom few therapeutic options are available. Preliminary data also show that acadesine has in vitro toxicity toward other B-cell malignancies, such as mantle cell lymphoma (especially when combined with monoclonal antibodies) and multiple myeloma. ',\n"," \"Patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can be treated by subsequent immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). But unlike myeloid leukemia, B cell leukemia and lymphoma are less sensitive to allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy. Moreover, the beneficial graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect may be associated with moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches augmenting the anti-tumor efficacy of DLI and dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD are needed. The anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) FBTA05 may improve the targeting of tumor cells by redirecting immune allogeneic effector cells while reducing the risk of undesirable reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD. Based on this underlying treatment concept and on promising data taken from preclinical results and a small pilot study, an open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II-study is conducted to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the investigational antibody FBTA05 in combination with DLI for patients suffering from rituximab- and/or alemtuzumab-refractory, CD20-positive low- or high-grade lymphoma after allogeneic SCT. During the first trial phase with emphasis on dose escalation a maximum of 24 patients distributed into 4 cohorts will be enrolled. For the evaluation of preliminary efficacy data a maximum of 12 patients (6 patients with low-grade lymphoma and/or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / 6 patients with high-grade or aggressive lymphoma) will attend the second phase of this clinical trial. Promising data (e.g. induction of cellular immunity; GVL predominance over GVHD; achievement of partial or complete responses; prolongation of time-to-progression) obtained from this phase I/II trial would represent the first milestone in the clinical evaluation of a novel immunotherapeutic concept for treatment-resistant low- and high-grade lymphoma and NHL patients in relapse. NCT01138579 Approximately half of the patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and the majority of patients with low-grade lymphomas cannot be cured by conventional therapeutic treatment regimes. Intensive chemotherapy followed by stem cell support has improved survival of patients with chemotherapy sensitive lymphoma. The majority of these patients, however, will still relapse, even after high-dose therapy and subsequently have limited therapeutic options. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can induce long-term remission due to a graft versus lymphoma (GVL) reaction, this occurs predominantly in a highly selected population of indolent lymphoma patients. \",\n"," 'A GVL reaction is less pronounced in patients with aggressive lymphoma, resulting in a high relapse rate. In patients not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, palliative treatment is restricted by resistance to chemotherapy and complications of infection. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies with improved anti-tumor efficacy need to be developed for such patients. Immunotherapies with monoclonal antibodies (mABs) directed against the CD20 antigen have previously been shown to be highly effective. Rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and Biogen IDEC Inc, Cambridge, MA), an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) 1 chimeric mAb, induced overall response rates (ORR) up to 50% in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade B cell lymphoma. In first line-treatment, rituximab induces response rates up to 75% in patients with follicular or low-grade NHL. But despite these encouraging results, there are still numerous patients who do not respond or finally relapse. Efforts to further increase the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies resulted in the development of trAb FBTA05 which mediates effective tumor cell cytotoxicity even at low CD20 expression levels, and probably even more importantly, induces a lasting anti-tumor immunity. FBTA05 is a heterologous antibody, composed of two potent heavy chain subclasses, a mouse IgG2a and a rat IgG2b chain, each with their respective light chains. It therefore possesses two specific and one functional binding site. FBTA05 binds with one binding arm to the CD3 antigen on T cells and with the second binding arm to the CD20 antigen, which is expressed exclusively on normal and malignant B cells, but not on hematological precursor cells or other human cell types. In addition, the third functional site within the hybrid Fc region binds to Fcgamma receptor type I, IIa and III which are expressed by accessory cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells) of the immune system. In this \"tri-cell complex\", an important \"crosstalk\" between T cells and accessory cells can occur, which includes co-stimulatory signals necessary for a physiological T cell activation cascade. The simultaneous activation of different immune cells at the tumor site results in efficient killing of tumor cells by several complementary mechanisms (e.g. release of cytokines, perforin-mediated lysis and phagocytosis). The antibody-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells by accessory cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) is believed to result in the processing of tumor antigens and presentation on the surface of these cells. ',\n"," 'result in polyclonal humoral and cellular immune responses, a T cell response even against unknown, tumor-associated peptides may be induced. The combined attack of various immune cells with different killing mechanisms induced by FBTA05 leads to a significant tumor cell elimination when compared to monospecific antibodies or conventional bispecific antibodies. In addition, the induction of a variety of effector mechanisms may result in a protective long-term anti-tumor immunity. The postulated mechanism of action of the trAb FBTA05 is shown in Figure 1. Prior to the start of the current phase I/II dose escalating study, FBTA05 was administered in a compassionate use setting to patients with recurrent and refractory B cell malignancies following allo-SCT, and within a phase I/II trial (IV-A05-LL-01, EudraCT No: 2006-006694-24) to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL in an autologous setting. In compassionate use a limited number of advanced cancer patients were treated with FBTA05. These, included 4 patients with refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), 4 patients with refractory high-grade non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (HG-NHL) and 1 patient with refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). The treatment comprised escalating doses of FBTA05 with a range of 10-2,000 mug per single infusion. The maximum cumulative dosage administered per patient ranged between 130-13,610 mug of FBTA05. The duration of treatment was between 5-76 days. Following FBTA05 treatment, patients received DLI. Due to the nature of the different indications, the number of peripheral B cells prior to the start of FBTA05 infusions showed a large variation. An anti-tumor response (decrease of leukemic cells and shrinking of lymph nodes) was observed in 3 of 4 CLL patients. In 1 case of HG-NHL, a halt of progression for almost 4 months was observed. The effect of FBTA05 in the other patients was not evaluable due to other concomitant treatment or disease (fungal infection). Relapse finally occurred in all patients. The main side effects were restricted to fever, chills, bone pain and transient increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGT). Only one case of GVHD (grade 3) was observed after FBTA05 and DLI and this was in the ALL patient. In context of the administration of the highest cumulative dose of FBTA05 (6,240 mug), a transient granulocytopenia was detected in a HG-NHL patient. The cytokine profile was characterized by a transient increase of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs) were not detectable. ',\n"," 'According to the current experience with the anti HER2/neu directed trAb ertumaxomab there is a correlation between the formation of HAMA and human anti-rat antibodies (HARAs), so HARA development in these patients would seem to be unlikely. Due to the changes in the development program of the sponsor (Fresenius Biotech GmbH) the phase I/II dose escalating study (IV-A05-LL-01, EudraCT No: 2006-006694-24) was prematurely terminated after treatment of 3 patients in the first cohort (maximum dose 100 mug FBTA05). Thus, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) could be established and only limited data on drug safety are available. In general, the intravenous infusion of FBTA05 was assessed to be safe and well tolerated, even at higher antibody doses. However, due to the limited number of patients treated, to variable disease progression in individual patients and to a variety of different concomitant treatments used, this information needs to be interpreted with caution. Antibody based therapies (rituximab, alemtuzumab), especially in combination with chemotherapeutic regimes, offer some advantages in patients with CLL and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Nevertheless, most patients finally relapse. Especially patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have a very poor prognosis in case of early relapse after chemotherapy combined with rituximab. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further develop alternative treatment options whereby the CD20 antigen represents a solid target for innovative therapeutic approaches: (i) it is expressed on most B-cell lymphomas, (ii) it is only expressed on B cells, but not precursor cells or human tissues and (iii) it is not shed or secreted upon antibody binding. The trAb FBTA05 provides a novel and unique approach for the targeted treatment of CD20 expressing neoplasias. The potency of FBTA05 has been demonstrated by efficient in vitro killing of human B cell tumor cells, as well as cells derived from CLL patients expressing only low levels of CD20. FBTA05 in combination with DLI has already been administered to patients in compassionate use prior to the start of the scheduled phase I/II study and assessed to be feasible, safe and well tolerated even at high antibody and T cell doses. Most importantly, some anti-tumor responses were observed in 3 CLL and 1 NHL patient. It is well established that DLI, given as a single treatment is effective in hematological relapse post-SCT, but it is suggested that concerted treatment with additional drugs may further improve treatment outcome. ',\n"," 'Thus, the combination of DLI and the anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trAb FBTA05 might be a promising treatment option for patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allo-SCT. Since both, the desired GVL and the unwanted detrimental GVHD responses are mediated by T lymphocytes present in DLI preparations, FBTA05 has the capacity to enhance these GVL effects as autologous and allogeneic T cells are targeted to tumor sites. At the same time as GVL of allogeneic T lymphocytes is strengthened by FBTA05 engagement the risks for GVHD development are reduced. Therefore, by adding FBTA05 to the established allogeneic DLI treatment regime patients may even benefit more from this combined therapeutic approach. Furthermore, FBTA05 should be given prior to DLI administration to allow the already bound anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trAbs FBTA05 to attract incoming allogeneic T lymphocytes directly to the CD20-expressing tumor cells. In other words, this treatment setting may favor GVL enhancement by simultaneously minimizing GVHD risks. This application sequence may be also important to control cytokine release due the increased number of CD3+ T target cells of FBTA05 in the blood circulation after DLI infusion. The opposite application order for FBTA05 and DLI would not mediate this positive effect of pre-coating tumor cells with trAb FBTA05 in vivo for attracting incoming allogeneic T lymphocytes. Moreover, preclinical and first clinical data confirmed this beneficial sequence for FBTA05 and DLI application. The present trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational trAb FBTA05 in combination with DLI for treatment of relapsed or refractory disease in CD20 positive CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL after allogeneic transplantation. The primary objective is the determination of the MTD of FBTA05 in phase I (dose-escalation part). In phase II (efficacy part), it is the preliminary evaluation of efficacy of a treatment schedule with FBTA05 and DLI in patients with CD20 positive either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL after allo-SCT. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of safety and pharmacodynamics of FBTA05 in combination with DLI, the induction of cellular immunity in terms of GVL or GVHD, and the determination of further efficacy data in terms of time to progression (TTP), duration of response and clinical benefit. The primary endpoint in Phase I is the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), in phase II the objective response rate. ',\n"," 'The secondary endpoints are safety and efficacy. Regarding safety, the recommended dose of FBTA05 in combination with DLI for further efficacy studies will be determined. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), the presence of HAMAs after FBTA05 application, the need to discontinue FBTA05 infusion, vital functions, the physical examination findings, laboratory parameters, concomitant medication and as pharmacodynamic endpoints the serum levels of cytokines will be recorded. In terms of efficacy the clinical benefit rate, the duration of response, the time to progression, the overall survival, the ECOG performance status, the tumor specific response, lymphocyte subsets, activation signs and memory status of T cells will be analysed. To evaluate differences in drug response to CLL/low grade NHL or high grade NHL, patients are enrolled into study cohorts according to their respective disease entity (either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL). As shown in Figure 2, the complete treatment course consists of a drug induction part (safety part) with defined FBTA05 doses of 10 mug on day 0, 20 mug on day 3 and 50 mug on day 7, as well as a drug maintenance / escalation part (course I and II, see also Table 1). The final antibody infusion of each part is followed by a dose-escalated application of donor lymphocytes. Each cohort includes at least 2 patients. In a strict sequential order, treatment and dose escalation (cohort A-D, Table 1) is performed independently for each disease entity (either CLL / low-grade NHL or high-grade NHL). Thus, treatment of any subsequent patient 2 or 3 at a certain dose level will be started only after the safety part treatment of the previous patient of the same disease entity is completed, and the External Safety Board (ESB), acting as a Dose Steering Board (DSB), agrees to the enrolment of the next patient. The same dose escalation procedure will be applied throughout the study for all Cohorts (A-D). If one dose-limiting toxicity is seen, a total of 3 patients of the same disease entity must be treated at that dose level. If two dose-limiting toxicities are seen at any dose level, treatment for this disease entity is terminated and the MTD will be established at the next lower dosing level. If 2 of 3 patients of the same disease entity in Cohort A show dose-limiting toxicities, the MTD has been reached and lower dose levels may have to be investigated. ',\n"," 'After the phase I part of the study an interim analysis will be performed. Based on the outcome of this analysis the recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part will be proposed by the ESB and the investigators on the basis of the MTD and any other relevant safety issues. The recommended dose will not exceed the maximal dose foreseen in the protocol approved by the competent authority. The report of the interim analysis with the recommended dose will be presented to the ethics committee and competent authority. A maximum of 6 patients per disease entity will receive treatment during phase II. If the last Cohort at MTD level in phase I already included 2 or 3 patients for CLL/low grade NHL, respectively high-grade NHL, an additional 4 or 3 patients per disease entity will be enrolled in phase II. There will be a maximum of 24 patients in the MTD evaluation part of phase I: 12 patients for CLL / low-grade NHL, 12 patients for high-grade NHL. There will be a maximum of 12 patients in phase II of the study: 6 patients for CLL / low-grade NHL, 6 patients for HG-NHL. A total of maximal 30 patients will be included in the study. Patients of both genders, any ethnic origin and at least 18 years old are included in the study if they meet the criteria given in Table 2. All participating patients have to sign the written informed consent. Patients can be withdrawn from the study for medical reasons at any time and must be withdrawn in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity. Patients can recall their consent at any time without any negative implications for their further treatment. The investigational drug FBTA05 is provided by the TRION Pharma GmbH (Munich, Germany) as a sterile, pyrogen-free, color-free and preservative-free solution for infusion. The concentrate contains 0.2 mg/ml antibody per 100mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6), with 0.02% Tween 80. Depending on the dose level, FBTA05 is further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution for i.v. infusion. FBTA05 is administered with a constant rate over 6 hours by intravenous (i.v.) infusion. To avoid infusion reactions typically occurring after i.v. antibody infusions, i.v. Paracetamol (1,000 mg) and i.v. Dimetinden (4 mg) are administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of infusion. Three hours after the start of FBTA05 infusion, i.v. Paracetamol (500 - 1,000 mg) is repeated. ',\n"," 'Post-infusion, Paracetamol and Dimetinden are administered, as needed. In phase I, each patient (cohort A - D) will undergo the same safety part and receive induction doses of FBTA05 on day 0 (10 mug), day 3 (20 mug) and day 7 (50 mug). During the maintenance part, FBTA05 applications are scheduled for course I on day 14 (+- 1 day), 21 (+- 1 day), 28 (+- 1 day) and 35 (+- 1 day), for course II on day 42 (+- 1 day), 49(+- 1 day), 56 (+- 1 day) and 63 (+- 1 day). Thereby dose escalation of FBTA05 will be performed according to the respective Cohort A - D (Table 1). Donor lymphocyte infusion is scheduled in each cohort at the end of the safety part (day 7), as well as at the end of course I (day 35) and course II (day 63). The numbers of infused T cells are escalated according to the respective preparative regimen applied for allo-SCT as shown in Table 3. DLI will not be performed in case the of GVHD or active infection at the time of DLI, or in the rare cases that DLI is not available for technical reasons. In this case antibody application will be continued as scheduled without DLI. In phase II the recommended dose will be applied according to the respective treatment schedule as determined in phase I. Patients are required to complete screening procedures and 14 treatment visits (11 applications of FBTA05; 3 applications of DLI), so far as the dosage regimen is tolerated according to MTD assessments. Two weeks after the last infusion (week 12), patients will attend an end-of-study visit (EOS). In follow up, patients will attend 4 additional post-study follow-up visits (6, 9, 12 and 24 months after start of treatment). Patients enrolled in phase II will follow the identical screening, treatment and post-study follow-up schedule as for phase I. An ESB, composed of three independent experienced clinical experts is responsible for the evaluation of the patients. Together with the investigators they decide, whether individual patients may continue the study, and whether or not dose escalation can be applied. The ESB is involved in the assessment and declaration of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) as well as the evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). ',\n"," 'Moreover, based on the results of the interim analysis at the end of the phase I, the ESB together with the investigators will propose the recommended dose (RD) for phase II. The condition for a DLT is fulfilled in the case of termination of treatment due to an adverse reaction. Thereby, the treatment schedule for a patient must be terminated if any toxicity grade >= 3, condition or adverse event (e.g. body temperature >= Grade 3 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) (40 C), systolic BP < 75 or > 210 mm Hg, pulse < 50 or > 150 bpm or a dyspnoea grade IV) does not normalize within 3 hours. Furthermore, treatment will be terminated in case of an anaphylactic reaction, including, but not limited to severe angioedema, severe bronchospasm, severe urticaria or anaphylactic shock which occurs during the infusion. An adverse reaction, including clinical conditions of CTC Grade >= 3 or clinically relevant laboratory abnormality of CTC Grade >= 3 which occurs after the infusion and does not resolve until the planned date of the next infusion will also be grounds for termination of treatment. To assure the safety of the study patients a substantial examination program is performed. The patients are under hospital surveillance at least 1 hour prior to infusion and for 24 hours after the start of infusion. Physical examinations are performed at all scheduled visits and vital parameters (e.g. blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen-saturation and body temperature) are monitored throughout the infusion time until 24 hours after start of infusion. Moreover, patients are evaluated with regard to clinical signs, symptoms (including AEs) and subjective well-being. Laboratory parameters for safety analysis and immune monitoring are evaluated at every study visit. Moreover, during treatment, blood will be drawn prior to the start of infusion, at the end of the 6-hour drug infusion period and at 24 after the start of infusion. Blood chemistry parameters include sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, bilirubin (total), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, or SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, or SGPT) gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphastase, antithrombin III, albumin, creatinine, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), quick prothrombin time, fibrinogen and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Hematology parameters encompass hematocrit, hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, reticulocytes, platelets and differential WBC. ',\n"," 'An extensive immune monitoring program determines lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8 T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes) including effector, central memory as well as regulatory T cells and cytokine release profiles comprising interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Experimental ELISPOT-analysis to evaluate the induction of tumor specific immune responses after treatment with FBTA05 is restricted to CLL samples. Bone marrow biopsies are done before the start of treatment, moreover at the EOS and, 12 and 24 months after the start of therapy. Disseminated tumor cells will be determined by analyzing bone marrow aspirates taken from the iliac crest. Changes in the presence of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow will be assessed according to NCI criteria. Tumor assessment via imaging techniques (sonography, compute tomography, magnetic resonance tomography or positron-emission tomography) is clinical practise for the advanced stage of disease and will be performed at the screening, end of study visit and follow up visits scheduled 6, 9, 12 and 24 month after onset of the study. Assessment will be done according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The study is exploratory and is not powered to address any predefined hypotheses. The safety analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least one FBTA05 infusion. The efficacy analysis will be performed on both the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least the first three infusions and the first DLI (safety part). Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by use of appropriate descriptive techniques. The FBTA05 trial is supported by the Bavarian Immunotherapy Network (BayImmuNet) and the Munich m4-Biotech Cluster.

',\n"," 'Before start of the trial, the trial protocol, informed consent document and any other trial documents were submitted to the independent ethics committee and the regulatory authority (Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, PEI). Ethics approval was granted on 14 January 2010, PEI approval on 16 July 2010. The trial protocol was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov and was given the number NCT01138579. The procedures set out in this trial protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation and documentation of this trial, are designed to ensure that all persons involved in the trial abide by Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles described in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial will be carried out in keeping with local legal and regulatory requirements. The idea to redirect immunity via bispecific antibodies is currently one of the most compelling concepts in cancer treatment. In the meantime, various bispecific antibody formats have entered clinical trials indicating their enormous therapeutic potential. In the present phase I/II trial, the anti-CD3 x anti-CD20 trAb FBTA05 is applied in combination with DLI in patients with CD20-positive CLL, low- and high-grade NHL relapsed or refractory after allo-SCT. The primary goal of this combined FBTA05/DLI treatment approach is to further improve an already successful allogeneic DLI regime for patients with resistant B cell malignancies who relapsed after allo-SCT. In addition, Riechelmann and co-workers showed that opsonization of autologous effector cells (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells) with anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 trAb catumaxomab led to beneficial results (i.e. tolerability, safety and response) in patients with intractable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Based on these findings and anticipating our own preliminary clinical data from a small pilot study, the planned treatment schedule is designed to enhance the targeting of tumor cells by allogeneic T lymphocytes while reducing the risk of undesirable GVHD reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD as already shown in preclinical models. Of note, these studies about the enhancement of graft-versus-tumor effects and the reduction of GVHD by means of combined DLI/trAb application was thoroughly performed upon administration of C57 splenocytes with or without pretreatment of anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3 trAb BiLu in (BALB x C57BL/6) F1 H-2d/b mice that were previously inoculated with a lethal dose of B16-EpCAM melanoma cells. Importantly, the C57 spleen cells were syngeneic to the B16-EpCAM tumor cells, but haploidentically mismatched to host cells. ',\n"," 'Treatment with BiLu protected recipient mice from the alloreactive C57 splenocytes, as GVHD-related death was observed in only 20% of mice whereas almost all mice inoculated with naive C57 splenocytes w/o BiLu pretreatment died of GVHD. In total 50% of all treated mice were disease-free in this experimental settings. BiLu treatment w/o cell therapy also had a substantial anti-tumor effect, as a similar proportion of treated mice were disease-free under these conditions. Thus, future trials could also address the feasibility to pass on DLI in relevant clinical settings. Here, this clinical study with a combined trAb/DLI treatment might provide further insights into the capacity of this therapeutic regime to deplete malignant B cells, activate the immune system and induce secondary cell-mediated immunity.

',\n"," \"The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in few durable remissions. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01105247.) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. Therapy for symptomatic CLL has consisted predominantly of chemotherapeutic agents, including chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and combinations of these agents that are effective for palliation but do not improve survival. The addition of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to chemotherapy (fludarabine alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide) results in higher response rates, extended remissions, and improved overall survival. However, a subgroup of patients with deletion of 17p13.1 have a poor response to chemoimmunotherapy, and patients with tumors expressing unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain genes have shorter remissions than those with mutated genes. Furthermore, chemoimmunotherapy is not curative, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased toxicity and reduced antitumor activity. Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, CLL lacks a common genetic target. However, B-cell-receptor signaling has emerged as a driving factor for CLL tumor-cell survival. \",\n"," \"Downstream of the B-cell receptor and of critical importance to its function is a member of the Tec family of kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK mutations in humans cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which leads to the absence of peripheral-blood B cells, decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin, and increased susceptibility to infections. BTK is essential for activation of several constitutively active pathways of CLL-cell survival, including the Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathways. In addition, BTK is essential to chemokine-mediated homing and adhesion of B cells. Given the importance of B-cell-receptor signaling in CLL and the central role of BTK in this pathway, an attractive strategy is to target inhibition of this kinase. Ibrutinib (Pharmacyclics) is an orally bioavailable, potent inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.5 nM) that covalently binds to the cysteine-481 amino acid of the BTK enzyme. Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib treatment inhibits numerous processes, including ERK signaling, NF-kappaB DNA binding, cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-mediated CLL-cell proliferation, and tumor-cell migration. Ibrutinib does not have toxic effects on normal T cells; this distinguishes it from most regimens used for CLL. A phase 1 study of ibrutinib showed mild-to-moderate toxicity and clinical antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell cancers; 11 of the 16 patients in the study had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. These preliminary results prompted the initiation of a phase 1b-2 study of ibrutinib in CLL; this study involved two different therapeutic doses in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Eligibility criteria included the following: a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as defined according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and World Health Organization classifications; a need for treatment; adequate renal and hepatic function, defined by a creatinine level of no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and an alanine aminotransferase level of no more than 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range; and an absence of active infection. The first and second cohorts were required to have received at least two previous therapies, including a purine analogue. A third cohort was composed of patients with high-risk disease that did not respond to a chemoimmunotherapy regimen or that progressed within 24 months after completion of the regimen. \",\n"," 'neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter were required initially. However, an amendment to the protocol allowed enrollment of 22 patients with any degree of cytopenia if it was due to bone marrow involvement. Exclusion criteria were any type of cancer that limited survival to less than 2 years, gastrointestinal disease that might inhibit ibrutinib absorption, and medicines associated with torsades de pointes. Testing to detect interphase cytogenetic abnormalities, immunoglobulin-gene mutational analysis, and measurement of beta2-microglobulin levels were performed during the screening period by a central reference laboratory. This phase 1b-2, open-label, multicenter study was designed to determine the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. In addition, we sought to examine the influence of features of a poor prognosis on the clinical response to ibrutinib. An institutional review board approved the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) at each study site. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written informed consent. The study is ongoing. Two cohorts of patients (27 patients in cohort 1 and 24 patients in cohort 3) were assigned to receive a fixed daily dose of 420 mg of ibrutinib, and one cohort (34 patients in cohort 2) was assigned to receive a daily dose of 840 mg, with both doses administered orally on a continuous schedule until the onset of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment in the three cohorts occurred consecutively from May 2010 through August 2011. On the basis of early data from cohort 1, cohort 3 was added to study the effect of 420 mg in patients with high-risk disease. The primary end point was the safety of the two fixed-dose regimens, assessed according to the frequency and severity of adverse events. Safety monitoring, which included a clinical history taking, physical examination, and laboratory tests, was performed weekly for the first month, every other week for the second month, and monthly thereafter. Adverse events were graded with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf). Hematologic toxic effects were graded according to the system of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (2008). ',\n"," \"The secondary end points were the overall response rate, progression-free survival, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. A response assessment that included a radiologic examination was performed at the end of cycles 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 24. A bone marrow biopsy was performed to confirm a complete response. The response in patients with CLL was evaluated according to the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with the exception that lymphocytosis was not the sole criterion for disease progression (a summary of the response criteria is available in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). For patients with persistent lymphocytosis, a partial response in all other measures was characterized as a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response in patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma was evaluated according to the International Working Group criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2007). Putative biomarkers of response and overall survival were exploratory end points. We conducted pharmacokinetic studies to determine the exposure to ibrutinib after treatment at both dose levels. The pharmacokinetic measures were derived from the nominal plasma concentration-time curves. Pharmacodynamic testing was performed to assess the level of drug binding to BTK (BTK occupancy) after treatment. A cell-permeable, fluorescently tagged derivative of ibrutinib was used to visualize BTK before treatment and 4 and 24 hours after treatment, as previously described. The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics and Janssen. All the authors and the sponsors were responsible for designing the study protocol and analysis plan. All the authors and their respective research teams collected all the data, and the sponsors confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled it for summation and analysis. The authors had full access to the data and analyses for compilation of this report. Manuscript drafts were prepared by the authors with editorial assistance from a professional medical writer paid by Janssen. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of the study to the protocol, and all the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for discrete variables, were used to summarize the findings in each of the defined cohorts. All analyses included patients who received the study drug. The overall response rate with a 95% confidence interval was calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for time-to-event analysis (curves and corresponding quartiles). \",\n"," \"Data on progression-free survival were censored when patients received new anticancer therapy or at the last clinical assessment, for patients who were lost to follow-up. No imputation of missing values was performed. In an exploratory analysis, characteristics associated with response and progression-free survival and overall survival were compared by means of Fisher's exact test in each subgroup. Analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. A total of 85 patients were enrolled at eight sites. The baseline characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1, and in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. The patients, who were generally considered to have high-risk disease, had received a median of four previous therapies. A total of 65% of the patients had advanced-stage disease, 33% had 17p13.1 deletions, and 36% had 11q22.3 deletions. At a median follow-up of 20.9 months (range, 0.7 to 26.7), 54 patients (64%) were still receiving treatment, and 31 (36%) had discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation (detailed in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix) included disease progression in 11 patients (13%); the patient's or investigator's decision in 13 (15%), of whom 5 patients then underwent stem-cell transplantation; and adverse events in 7 patients (8%), including 3 patients who had pneumonia, 2 who had sepsis, 1 who had staphylococcal bacteremia without physiological signs of sepsis, and 1 who had gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The steady-state concentration-time profiles of ibrutinib after administration of 420 mg or 840 mg per day are shown in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The exposure to ibrutinib increased proportionally from a dose of 420 to 840 mg per day. No differences in the time to the peak ibrutinib concentration in the blood (median Tmax, 2 hours [range, 0.5 to 6]) or the terminal half-life (7.8+-3.6 hours with 420 mg per day and 8.1+-3.4 hours with 840 mg per day) were apparent between doses. Post-treatment assessments indicated full occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib at both dose levels. The median level of BTK occupancy was 96 to 99% (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix); it was observed as early as 4 hours after the dose was administered and was maintained 24 hours after the dose was administered, at both dose levels. Long-term therapy with ibrutinib was associated with modest toxicity; most adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 2). \",\n"," 'The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection, and most adverse events resolved without the need for a suspension of treatment. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2 patients in the 420-mg cohort (4%) and in 4 patients in the 840-mg cohort (12%). Serious adverse events are listed in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were pneumonia (in 10 patients [12%]) and dehydration (in 5 patients [6%]). Infections of grade 3 or higher occurred most frequently early in the course of therapy. The average rate of infection was 7.1 per 100 patient-months during the first 6 months and 2.6 per 100 patient-months thereafter (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The exposure-adjusted rate of infections that were grade 3 or higher was reduced by more than half after 6 months of treatment (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). IgG and IgM levels remained relatively stable throughout treatment, whereas IgA levels increased at 3, 6, and 12 months (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects were infrequent; 5 patients (6%) had anemia, 13 patients (15%) had neutropenia, and 5 patients (6%) had thrombocytopenia. Bleeding events that were grade 3 or higher in severity occurred in 4 patients. A total of 8 patients died within 30 days after receiving the last dose of ibrutinib: 3 deaths were from pneumonia, 1 was from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 1 was from sarcoma, and 3 were related to CLL progression. The overall response rate based on the standard criteria was 71% (2 complete responses and 34 partial responses) in the 420-mg cohort and 71% (24 partial responses) in the 840-mg cohort. In addition, 10 patients in the 420-mg cohort (20%) and 5 patients in the 840-mg cohort (15%) had a partial response with persistent lymphocytosis. Blood lymphocytosis was generally noted by day 7 (in 78% of the patients); it peaked at a median of 4 weeks and then slowly declined. In 50 of 63 patients (79%), the lymphocyte count normalized (absolute lymphocyte count, <4x109 cells per cubic millimeter) or was reduced by 50% from the baseline level. Treatment-related lymphocytosis developed at similar frequencies in patients with unmutated and those with mutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain genes (77% and 83%, respectively). ',\n"," \"However, in patients with unmutated immunoglobulin genes, lymphocyte counts normalized more rapidly (median, 6.4 vs. 14.8 months) and more frequently (in 85% vs. 50% of the patients). Lymphocytosis occurred concomitantly with a notable reduction in lymph-node size (Fig. 1A) and spleen size, as well as frequent improvement in cytopenias (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). An improved response was time-dependent (Fig. 1B); increasing numbers of partial responses and complete responses occurred during follow-up, whereas the frequency of a partial response with lymphocytosis diminished as the lymphocyte count decreased over time. As shown in Figure 2, the response to ibrutinib did not appear to vary according to traditional high-risk prognostic features. The response rate among the patients with a 17p13.1 deletion was 68%, including one complete response, whereas the response rate was 71% among those without this deletion. The only factor associated with a response was the mutation status of the immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene. Notably, 4 of the 12 patients with a mutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene (33%) had a partial response or complete response and 5 (42%) had a partial response with lymphocytosis. By contrast, 53 of the 69 patients with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene (77%) had a partial response or complete response and 9 (13%) had a partial response with lymphocytosis. This difference in the overall response rate (partial response plus complete response) was significant (P = 0.005), whereas the combined overall response rate plus the rate of partial response with lymphocytosis did not differ significantly according to mutation status. Sustained improvement in cytopenias, defined as improvement by more than 50% or a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g per deciliter, an absolute neutrophil count higher than 1500 cells per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count higher than 100,000 cells per cubic millimeter (lasting for >=2 cycles without transfusion or administration of growth factors), was frequently observed during ibrutinib treatment (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Improvement was observed in 32 of 41 patients with baseline thrombocytopenia (78%), 27 of 33 with anemia (82%), and 24 of 31 with neutropenia (77%). Ibrutinib treatment promoted durable responses, irrespective of the dose. The 26-month estimated rate of progression-free survival (Fig. 3A, top graph) was 75%, and the rate of overall survival (Fig. 3B, top graph) was 83%. Disease progression developed in 11 patients (13%) during follow-up, and 7 of those patients had progression by biologic transformation (Richter's syndrome). \",\n"," 'The median time from the initial diagnosis of CLL to transformation was 98 months (range, 24 to 143). Among the 11 patients in whom progressive disease developed, 10 patients had a 17p13.1 or a 11q22.3 deletion, and 1 patient did not have high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (Fig. 3A). Patients had a prolonged time to progression despite high-risk genomic features. Among the 28 patients with a 17p13.1 deletion : a uniformly poor prognostic factor : the 26-month estimated rate of progression-free survival (Fig. 3A) was 57% and the rate of overall survival (Fig. 3B) was 70%. Patients who discontinued ibrutinib for reasons other than progression remained in the study and were followed quarterly until disease progression, the initiation of new anticancer therapy, or death. After disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, follow-up was limited to survival status. Treatment at the time of new treatment initiation was left to the discretion of the treating physician. The responses to ibrutinib, the covalent inhibitor of BTK, that we observed in this study were more durable than expected on the basis of previous experience with other single-agent therapies for relapsed CLL. At both doses of ibrutinib that we studied, pharmacokinetic data showed rapid absorption and elimination. Moreover, pharmacodynamic data showed that once-daily ibrutinib provided effective and complete occupancy of BTK, a surrogate of kinase inhibition. Ibrutinib caused a transient increase in blood lymphocyte levels, which was concurrent with a reduction in lymph-node size, spleen size, or both. Continued treatment with ibrutinib led to resolution of this asymptomatic lymphocytosis, and patients were characterized as having a classic response according to the 2008 criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with an observed response rate of 71%. Fifteen additional patients (18%) in this study had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Treatment-related lymphocytosis has been seen with other agents that target B-cell-receptor signaling; these findings have prompted several groups of CLL experts to conclude that such lymphocytosis is not a sign of progressive disease. Our findings provide support for an ibrutinib-mediated pharmacodynamic effect on CLL by cell mobilization from protected bone marrow, lymphnode, and spleen sites harboring stromal elements that have been shown to promote leukemic-cell proliferation, drug resistance, and survival. ',\n"," \"Despite the immunocompromised condition of the patients, who had received a median of four previous therapies, ibrutinib treatment did not result in an increased incidence of grade 3 or higher infections during the extended therapy period, as compared with the rates reported in several series of patients who received traditional salvage therapies. The incidence of infection was highest early in the course of ibrutinib treatment and decreased with continued therapy. During treatment, improvement in neutrophil counts occurred in patients with baseline neutropenia (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix), with significant increases in the level of serum IgA and no detrimental effects on IgG or IgM levels (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The analysis of immunoglobulin levels was limited to patients with relatively preserved immunoglobulin levels, since those who received intravenous immune globulin were excluded. The occurrence of ecchymosis, petechiae, or both was noted on the skin in a subgroup of patients who received ibrutinib, but these conditions were not accompanied by excess bleeding or associated with thrombocytopenia. Randomized trials comparing the safety profile of ibrutinib with that of other therapeutic agents for CLL are ongoing. These trials include A Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) Versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707) and A Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor PCI-32765 Versus Chlorambucil in Patients 65 Years or Older with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE-2, NCT01722487). Several validated high-risk characteristics of CLL, including 17p13.1 deletion, did not influence the objective response to ibrutinib. However, most events associated with disease progression occurred in patients with high-risk cytogenetic lesions (17p13.1 deletion or 11q22.3 deletion), whereas only one patient without these risk factors had an event associated with disease progression. Patients with an unmutated immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain gene, perhaps owing to enhanced B-cell-receptor signaling and dependence on this pathway, had earlier resolution of lymphocytosis and were more frequently classified as having a response according to traditional response criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (P = 0.02); however, survival outcomes were similar to those among patients without this unmutated gene. Greater than 90% occupancy of the pharmacodynamic probe and the similar response in the two dose groups provide support for the use of the 420-mg dose of ibrutinib for relapsed CLL. \",\n"," 'Ibrutinib has a favorable therapeutic index, which may facilitate its use in combination with other agents for the treatment of CLL. However, the durable remissions obtained thus far suggest that many patients may be treated successfully with monotherapy. ',\n"," 'Forodesine was originally developed for T-cell leukemias and was effective in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The current study was done to test its utility in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Our preclinical investigations (lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with B-ALL [n=12]) demonstrate activity in vitro. Minimal activity in the clinic suggests that this agent should be used in combination with other established or novel ALL agents. The discovery that purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency leads to T-cell lymphopenia was the basis for introducing PNP inhibitors for T-cell leukemias. Forodesine is an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor with picomolar potency. Because T lymphoblasts and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics to accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), forodesine demonstrated promising activity in preclinical and clinical settings for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell CLL (B-CLL). However, the use of forodesine in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is unknown. Leukemic blasts obtained from pediatric patients with de novo B-ALL (n=10) were incubated with forodesine and deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and the biological end points of apoptosis, intracellular dGTP accumulation, and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis were measured. Additionally, adult patients with B-ALL (n= 2) were intravenously infused with 80 mg/m2/d daily for 5 days. After therapy, clinical response, toxicity, laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition, and plasma forodesine, dGuo, and intracellular dGTP levels were analyzed. Our in vitro investigations demonstrated that forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation and induced modest apoptosis in de novo B-ALL lymphoblasts. There was time-dependent accumulation of dGTP and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. During therapy, neither patient achieved a complete response (CR), but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. There was significant maintained inhibition of PNP enzyme in red blood cells, accumulation of forodesine and dGuo in plasma, and intracellular dGTP accumulation in both patients. Our preclinical and clinical investigations suggest that forodesine has activity in B-ALL. However, it needs to be either infused with dGuo or combined with established chemotherapeutic agents based on mechanistic rationale. The discovery of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, a metabolic disorder that results in congenital immunodeficiency in association with severe T-cell immune depletion, and the elucidation of its pathophysiologic characteristics provided the rationale for the development of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) analogs for leukemias. Because dGuo is readily catabolized by PNP, phar-macologic inhibition of this enzyme manifests a deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP)-mediated T-cell lymphopenia. ',\n"," 'Although T-cell-specific depletion was observed with dGuo, the efficient catabolism of dGuo by PNP limited its use clinically. Taken together, these data provided a rationale for the development of PNP-resistant dGuo analogs or PNP inhibitors for the treatment of leukemias. The PNP-resistant dGuo derivative arabinosylguanine (ara-G) is toxic to T lymphoblasts and resistant to degradation by endogenous PNP. Once within cells, ara-G is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase into ara-GTP. The resultant accumulation of intracellular ara-GTP inhibits DNA synthesis. Similar to dGuo, ara-G has shown antileukemic activity in T-lymphoblastic cell lines and in the clinic through a T-lymphoid lineage-specific accumulation of ara-GTP during therapy. A clinical trial conducted by the Childrens Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group of nelarabine, a prodrug of ara-G, in refractory T-cell leukemias and lymphomas demonstrated higher responses in T-ALL. Additionally, a phase II trial in patients with refractory T-cell malignancies demonstrated substantial single-agent activity, with an objective response rate of more than 50% in the subset of patients with T-cell leukemia. Of note, some activity was also seen in patients with B-lineage disease. Forodesine (also known as BCX-1777/immucillin H) was developed as an orally bioavailable novel PNP transition-state inhibitor with a low picomolar inhibitory constant for human enzymes. The principal requisite for this agent to demonstrate its action relies on complete inhibition (> 95%) of the PNP enzyme and subsequent accumulation of dGTP, the intracellular metabolite of substrate dGuo. Forodesine exhibited cytotoxicity in T-cell leukemia cell lines through accumulation of large amounts of intracellular dGTP perturbing the cellular milieu. This in vitro activity in cell lines provided the impetus to initiate a clinical study in patients with T-cell leukemia to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this inhibitor. In agreement with its preclinical activity, forodesine demonstrated promising activity in patients with T-cell leukemia through accumulation of dGuo in plasma and dGTP in leukemia cells. Forodesine is also effective against indolent B- and T-cell diseases (both in vitro and in clinical trials), as well as in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. With this background, we proposed to test forodesine in B-ALL based on the following rationale. First, akin to T cells, inhibition of PNP promotes accumulation of dGTP, subsequent imbalance in the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and eventually cell death in B cells. Second, T-cell therapies such as nelarabine have demonstrated clinical activity in B-cell leukemias. ',\n"," 'have demonstrated clinical activity in B-cell leukemias. Third, B cells have high levels of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the enzyme that facilitates the accumulation of dGTP. Fourth, the rate-limiting enzyme dCK that converts dGuo to dGTP is present in high levels in pediatric lymphoblasts. Finally, forodesine has demonstrated some activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of forodesine in B-ALL. Given that B cells contain high levels of dCK, we hypothesized that this agent could sensitize B-ALL lymphoblasts to apoptosis. Our preclinical studies with 12 pediatric patients with de novo acute leukemia (most had B-ALL [10 patients] with 1 each T-ALL and acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) and extended studies on clinical evaluation of adult patients with B-ALL (n = 2) provide the rationale for utility of this agent in B-cell leukemias. Forodesine for clinical use was provided by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL). For quantitation of deoxynucleotides, dNTPs were obtained from Amersham/GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Pittsburgh, PA) and were used as standards. [3H]deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and [3H]deoxythymidine triphosphate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham, MA) and MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA), respectively. This project consists of reports from 2 studies: in vitro investigations in blasts from de novo pediatric acute leukemia with forodesine (n=12) and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluations of forodesine in adult patients with B-ALL (n=2) during therapy. Among pediatric patients, the majority were patients with active B-ALL (B-ALL [n=10]; acute myelogenous leukemia [AML] [n=1]; acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL] [n=1]). Whole blood or bone marrow was collected in heparinized tubes from pediatric patients with leukemia at initial diagnosis. The specimen was diluted 1:3 with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.135 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4 [pH 7.4]) and layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque (specific gravity, 1.086; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The blood was then centrifuged at 433g for 20 minutes, and mononuclear cells were removed from the interphase. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 10 mL RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The isolated lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo in a culture incubator at 37 C. These concentrations were selected based on plasma pharmacologic data obtained during a phase I study of forodesine. ',\n"," \"Cultures were maintained and aliquots (1x107 cells/mL) were removed at the end of incubation times. A Coulter channelyzer (Coulter Electronics) was used to determine cell number and mean cell volume. These cells were measured for intracellular dNTP, macromolecule syntheses, and apoptosis levels. The lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo. Cultures were maintained and aliquots (1x107 cells/mL) were removed at the end of incubation times (24 or 48 hours). Percent apoptosis was measured by annexin V binding assay (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, fresh cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 microL of 1xannexin binding buffer obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), at a concentration of 1x10 cells/mL. Annexin V:fluorescein isothiocyanate (5 microL) was added, and the cells were incubated in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature. Ten microliters (50 microg/mL) propidium iodide was then added to the labeled cells and analyzed immediately with a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data from at least 10,000 events per sample were recorded and processed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). The lymphoblasts were incubated with or without 2 microM forodesine and 20 microM dGuo for indicated time points (24 or 48 hours), and the global DNA and RNA syntheses were measured by [3H] thymidine and [3H]uridine incorporation assays. Before removal of the aliquot, 10 microCi/mL [3H]thymidine or [3H]uridine was added to these cultures, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 minutes. The labeled cells were then extracted using perchloric acid, and the pellets were incubated overnight with KOH at 37 C to dissolve DNA and RNA, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). PNP inhibition was measured by spectrophotometric assay. Erythrocytes were separated from whole blood and PNP was extracted from red blood cells by cell hemolysis. Addition of the substrate inosine results in conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine by PNP. Hypoxanthine is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase to form a stable product, uric acid. The accumulation of uric acid is quantitatively determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 293 nm. The observed data are then normalized by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm, which represents the number of erythrocytes used to prepare the PNP extract. \",\n"," 'The inhibitory effect was calculated using the equation [1 :(PNP activity post dose/PNP activity pre dose)] x 100. Blood samples (10 mL) before and after treatment at indicated days were obtained in green-stopper Vacutainer tubes containing heparin and 50 microM BCX-3424 (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals) as an internal control. The plasma was removed after centrifugation and stored at :70 C and analyzed at BioCryst Pharmaceuticals. Plasma dGuo and forodesine were analyzed as described previously using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Briefly, BCX-1777 was extracted from plasma using a phenylboronic acid affinity solid-phase extraction cartridge and dGuo was extracted from plasma using a Waters Oasis HLB affinity solid-phase extraction cartridge (Waters Corp, Milford, MA). The mass of BCX-1777 plus H+ (267.1 m/z) and the mass of dGuo plus H+ (268.1 m/z) are monitored in quadrupole 1. The BCX-1777 product ion 148.0 m/z and the dGuo product ion 157.0 m/z are monitored in quadrupole 3. The concentrations of forodesine and dGuo were determined by weighted (1/x) quadratic regression analysis of peak areas produced from the standard curve. Cells incubated in vitro with dGuo and forodesine were collected at different time points (24 or 48 hours at 37 C). Similarly, blood samples were obtained from patients at different time points during treatment with forodesine, and leukemic blasts were isolated. The nucleotides in the blast cells were extracted by 60% methanol as described previously, and the dNTPs were quantitated in these cell extracts by DNA polymerase assay as described by Sherman and Fyfe. Patients were eligible to participate if they had failed at least 1 previous treatment regimen for B-ALL. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or better, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, adequate organ function with aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels micro<=3 times the upper limit of normal, and calculated creatinine clearance > 40 mL/min. Female patients had to have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 to 7 days before the start of the study, and all patients had to be free of active or uncontrolled infection, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis viruses. Patients signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center before participation in the study. ',\n"," 'Blood samples were collected on the pretreatment day and on days 1 through 4 on cycles 1 to 3, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined. The clinical trial was a phase I/II open-label multicenter study of forodesine hydrochloride in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL, with the primary end point of assessing the safety of repeated intravenous doses of forodesine hydrochloride. Secondary end points included assessment of the efficacy of the drug in this disease, as well as evaluation of the steady-state pharmacokinetics and correlating pharmacodynamic parameters with any potential response. Patients were to receive 4 weeks of treatment with 5 days of intravenous dosing each week. Patients having clinical response (defined as achieving complete response [CR], CR without platelet recovery, partial response, or stable disease) could receive an additional 4 weeks of treatment with forodesine. Patients were evaluated for grades 3 and 4 non-hematologic toxicity and grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Forodesine treatment would be delayed or dosage reduced depending on the recovery from toxicity. All data were graphed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance (a value of .05) was determined by the 2-tailed paired Student t test. Characteristics of patients enrolled in the in vitro study are provided in Table 1 (pediatric B-ALL [n = 10]; T-ALL [n = 1]; AML [n = 1]; adult B-ALL [n = 2; No. 9001, No. 9002]). When measured by annexin/propidium iodide binding assay (Figure 1), in samples from 8 patients tested, there was heterogeneity in response to forodesine ranging from 2% to 40% apoptosis (normalized to time-matched control), with median 10% apoptosis. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant induction of apoptosis in these cells compared with untreated controls (Figure 1A, Figure 24 hours; P = .018; Figure 1B, Figure 48 hours; P = .041). There was no significant amount of apoptosis in the sample from patient 3, a patient with AML, compared with other patients with B-ALL. We do not have cytotoxicity data for patient 8, a patient with T-ALL. There was significant accumulation of dGTP in these cells, ranging between 3 and 90 microM, with a median 16 microM (24 hours; P = .045; n = 9; Figure 2A) after forodesine and dGuo treatment compared with time-matched controls (Figure 2B; Figure 48 hours). In particular, patient 8, who was diagnosed with T-ALL, showed 3-fold higher accumulation of dGTP levels compared with patients with B-ALL. ',\n"," 'When measured for dATP levels, there was no difference in accumulation between controls and treated samples (Figure 2C), which is consistent with our previous studies in T-cell leukemias. In general, cancer cells, including leukemic cells, are known to sustain their function through active DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. To test if for-odesine can potentially inhibit these macromolecule syntheses in these lymphoblasts as a result of perturbation of the dGTP pool, we performed [3H]uridine and [3H] thymidine incorporation assays to measure their levels of inhibition. Although samples varied in response to forodesine, there was significant inhibition of RNA synthesis at 24 hours (Figure 3A; n = 5; P = .015). For DNA synthesis, there was inhibition observed in 3 of 5 patients; however, the statistical analysis by 2-tailed t test did not show significance (Figure 3B; P = .0675). Samples 3a and 6a were collected at 48 hours for these patients. Of note, the values given are absolute disintegrations per minute values, and one can observe the variations in the basal levels of macromolecule synthesis between different patient samples. Two patients were treated with forodesine at 80 mg/m2/day daily for 5 days through 3 cycles. The study was closed early for slow accrual, and as such no further patients with B-ALL were treated. The first patient, a 61-year-old woman with precursor B-ALL, received initial therapy with the hyperCVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine [Oncovin], doxorubicin [Adriamycin], dexamethasone) regimen plus rituximab and achieved a CR after 2 courses of treatment but had disease relapse within 5 months. She went on to receive multiple salvage regimens, including augmented hyper-CVAD, liposomal vincristine, liposomal annamycin, combination high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate with alemtuzumab and rituximab, without achieving a response. She was then enrolled in the study and received 3 cycles of forodesine, with disease progression on day 8 of the third cycle, and treatment was discontinued. Five days later, she was hospitalized for progressive shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic pain and died of the complications of her disease and infection. The second patient was a 23-year-old woman with precursor B-ALL and t(4;11) who achieved CR after receiving 2 courses of the hyperCVAD regimen. She then underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an HIA-matched sibling after a preparative regimen of total body irradiation, etoposide, and rituximab. Her disease relapsed after transplantation and she received salvage therapy with liposomal vincristine and dexamethasone without a response. ',\n"," 'She completed 1 cycle of forodesine but experienced intracranial hemorrhage shortly after the initiation of cycle 2 and died of the associated complications. In summary, neither patient achieved a CR, but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. The pretreatment and end of infusion samples were collected between days 1 and 5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of week 2 and week 3. The red blood cells were isolated from whole blood, and the cells were processed to determine percent PNP inhibition in these samples. The inhibition of PNP for patient No. 9001 before therapy was 0% and increased to a median of 84% of inhibition (range 76%-95%) (Figure 4). Because accumulation of dGTP is promoted by PNP inhibition, > 90% PNP inhibition is required for this agent to be efficacious. Assessment of PNP inhibition for patient No. 9002 was not performed. To determine if forodesine was at steady-state level, we next measured the plasma forodesine levels during therapy in these 2 patients. Forodesine levels were quantitated on day 0 and at the end of infusion between days 1 and 5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of week 2 and week 3 (n = 2). For patient No. 9001 (Figure 5A; solid line), on day 0 the forodesine level was 0 microM and increased to 12 microM on day 1. By day 2, the level dropped to 2 microM before infusion and increased to 12 microM at the end of infusion. The pattern was very similar between pretreatment and end of infusion. For patient No. 9002 (Figure 5A; dashed line) the pattern was similar; however, the levels were almost half that of the other patient. The levels increased to 6 microM (range 4.7-6.7 microM) and dropped to 1 microM (range 0.21-2.3 microM) after treatment. These forodesine levels were comparatively higher than those in the samples of the patient with B-CLL, in which the maximum was 1.3 microM. With these concentrations of plasma forodesine and levels of PNP inhibition, an increase in endogenous dGuo was expected. The level of dGuo in pretreatment samples for patient No. 9001 was less than the level of detection and increased to 22 microM and then further to 38 microM and was maintained at 12 microM on day 4 of week 3 (Figure 5B; solid line). ',\n"," \"For patient No. 9002, the levels were again lower, ranging from 7 to 12 microM (Figure 5B; dashed line). The starting level of intracellular dGTP for patient No. 9001 on day 0 of cycle 1 was 11 microM and increased to 18 microM by the end of infusion. On day 2, there was an increase to 270 microM, with further elevation to 310 microM at the end of infusion. This level was maintained until day 4 of cycle 1. By cycle 3, the levels dropped to 37 microM and were maintained through day 4 (Figure 6A). For patient No. 9002, the intracellular dGTP levels were 10-fold less, with a maximum level of 15 microM (Figure 6B), suggesting heterogeneity in the accumulation of dGTP between patients. ALL is the most common malignancy of childhood. Although the cure rates for childhood ALL are currently about 80%, the outcome of relapsed ALL remains dismal, with an overall survival of only 10% for patients with early bone marrow relapse or a second or subsequent relapse. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the mainstay of treatment for relapsed ALL. However, recurrence rates are as high as 90% for patients with morphologic evidence of residual disease going into HSCT. In addition, higher levels of pretransplantation minimal residual disease have been shown to predict relapse after HSCT. 34-36 To that end, novel agents with the ability to induce a minimal residual disease:negative remission are needed. Forodesine may also play an important role in the setting of recurrent T-cell ALL now that nelarabine is moving to frontline regimens for those with high-risk disease. However, the role of forodesine in B-cell ALL is not clear. Preclinical investigations in primary T-ALL and B-ALL cells from pediatric patients have demonstrated activity of forodesine and dGuo in B lymphoblasts. The lower activity in B-ALL was associated with less dGTP accumulation, which may result from a lower level of expression of nucleoside transporters in B cells and a higher level of 5'-nucleotidase. In contrast to other nucleoside analogs, dGuo, as well as ara-G, are phosphorylated by dGuo kinase as well as dCyd kinase. Furthermore, both dGuo and ara-G are preferred substrates for dGuo kinase compared with dCyd kinase. At the mRNA level, both these kinases are present at similar levels in T lymphoblasts and B lymphoblasts from children. \",\n"," 'However, levels of proteins and the activity of enzymes will also affect the level of accumulation of triphosphate. This may explain heterogeneity among patients to accumulate dGTP after 24 and 48 hours of incubation with for-odesine and dGuo (Figure 2 A and B). Although there was only a modest effect on cell death of B-leukemic lymphoblasts (Figure 1), there was inhibition of DNA synthesis, suggesting there could be an impact on the cell proliferative index (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in a B-lymphoblastic cell line with ara-G, in which some S-phase cells were killed but then cells were blocked in S-phase of the cell cycle. This is in contrast to T cells, in which a majority of cells in S phase were killed; this was followed by cell death in other phases of the cell cycle by activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Partial inhibition of proliferation with limited apoptosis has also been observed in myeloma cell lines: another B-cell neoplasm albeit mature plasma B cells. Forodesine is a potent inhibitor of PNP, the mRNA of which is present at slightly higher levels in B cells. Most of the PNP is in large body organs and red blood cells. At the physiologic dose in patients with B-ALL, there was more than 85% inhibition of this enzyme in red blood cells (Figure 4). This inhibition resulted in a peak of at least 10 mM of dGuo in plasma (Figure 5B), suggesting that the desired concentration of dGuo could be achieved in patients with B-ALL. However, only higher levels of dGuo (patient No. 9001) resulted in more than 200 microM dGTP in B lymphoblasts. Lower dGuo resulted in only 10 microM of dGTP (Figure 6). Collectively, these data suggest that forodesine will need to be infused with dGuo or combined with chemotherapeutic agents based on the mechanistic rationale to have clinically meaningful activity in B-ALL. Despite advances in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with ALL, disease relapses in a significant majority of the former and a minority of the latter. New agents are needed to improve the outcome of these patients. Inhibition of PNP leading to depletion of T cells has been demonstrated with forodesine, an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor that has been previously evaluated for its efficacy in patients with T-ALL. Aside from T-ALL, forodesine has also demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in indolent lymphoid neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ',\n"," 'The current study was conducted to evaluate the activity of this agent in B-ALL, using lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with B-ALL for in vitro analysis. Concurrently, a phase II study examined the role of this agent in various leukemias, including 2 adult patients with B-ALL. Although the limited data prohibit definitive conclusions, this study suggests that forodesine may be a useful agent for B-ALL only when used in combination with other agents. ',\n"," 'New therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are needed, particularly those that can eradicate residual disease and elicit anti-CLL immune responses. CD40 ligation on CLL cells, which can be achieved using adenovirus encoding chimeric CD154 (Ad-ISF35), enhances their ability to function as antigen-presenting cells and increases their sensitivity to clearance by immune-effector mechanisms. In this study, we report the results of a first-in-man phase I trial of intranodal direct injection (IDI) of Ad-ISF35 in patients with CLL to evaluate toxicity, safety, and tolerability. Fifteen patients received a single IDI of 1 x 1010 to 33 x1010 Ad-ISF35 viral particles (vp), with a defined maximum tolerated dose as 1 x 1011 vp. Although the most common adverse events were transient grade 1 to 2 pain at the injection site and flu-like symptoms following IDI, some patients receiving the highest dose had transient, asymptomatic grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia, neutropenia, or transaminitis. Increased expression of death receptor, immune costimulatory molecules, and Ad-ISF35 vector DNA was detected in circulating CLL cells. Notably, we also observed preliminary clinical responses, including reductions in leukemia cell counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Six patients did not require additional therapy for more than 6 months, and three achieved a partial remission. In conclusion, Ad-ISF35 IDI was safely delivered in patients with CLLs and induced systemic biologic and clinical responses. These results provide the rationale for phase II studies in CLLs, lymphomas, and CD40-expressing solid tumors. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal B cells in the blood, lymphoid tissues, and marrow. Although advances in chemoimmunotherapy have resulted in improved response rates and have prolonged survival, such treatments can also impair hematopoiesis and immune function and are not well tolerated by all patients, particularly the elderly. Furthermore, most treated patients eventually relapse and require additional therapy and the disease still is considered incurable. It has been reported that the lymph node and bone marrow microenviroments play an important role in protecting CLL cells from apoptosis. Evidence exists to postulate that proliferating CLL cells in the lymph nodes are the source of the nonproliferating CLL cells present in the peripheral blood. However, most therapies used currently in CLLs do not target residual niches or leukemia cells that may depend heavily on the microenvironment. ',\n"," 'As such, relapse after chemotherapybased treatment is inevitable and this argues in favor of the development of novel treatment alternatives, including those that promote immune stimulation and activation of the tumor microenvironment. We have addressed this problem by studying in vitro and in vivo mechanism to promote cellular activation and immune recognition in CLL with an approach that involves transduction of CLL cells with vectors encoding the ligand for CD40 (CD154; ref.). Although the leukemia cells express high levels of human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) required for presentation of antigen to T cells, CLL cells are poor antigen-presenting cells. These cells lack expression of the immune costimulatory molecules required for effective T-cell activation and instead appear to suppress T-cell function. CD40 activation using recombinant antibodies or CD154 ligands have been used in patients with cancer and CLL showing objective clinical responses. Activation of B cells through CD40 changes its phenotype and induces immunoglobulin class switching and enhances its antigen-presenting capacity. Similar changes are also observed when CLL cells are activated via ligation of CD40, which can be achieved through transduction of CLL cells with an adenovirus (Ad) vector encoding CD154. Such transduced and CD40-activated CLL cells can induce autologous T-cell activation and immune recognition, leading to generation of anti-leukemia immune responses. We previously conducted clinical trials evaluating the safety and clinical activity of this approach. For these trials, patients underwent leukapheresis and CLL cells were subsequently transduced ex vivo with an Ad vector encoding either mouse-CD154 or a chimeric-humanized CD154, termed Ad-ISF35. Ad-ISF35 was developed to mitigate generation of immunity against mouse-CD154 and to improve membrane stability. Transduction of CLL cells with Ad-CD154 or Ad-ISF35 generated transduced CLL cells that had phenotypic features of CLL cells that had been activated by contact with CD154-bearing cells. Moreover, as these transduced CLL cells expressed a ligand for CD40, they also could activate bystander, nontransduced CLL cells to undergo such phenotypic changes. Clinical studies showed that i.v. infusions of autologous CLL cells that had been transduced with Ad-CD154 or Ad-ISF35 did not cause unacceptable or long-term toxicity, induced activation of \"bystander\" nontransduced CLL cells similar to that achieved by contact with CD154-/ISF35-bearing cells, almost invariably resulted in acute reductions in leukemia cell blood counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and could induce anti-leukemia immune responses. ',\n"," 'this approach, which also requires ex vivo processing of cells in specialized facilities that are not widely available. Therefore, we considered whether we could achieve similar biologic and clinical responses by injecting the Ad-ISF35 vector directly into pathologically enlarged lymph nodes of patients with CLL. This hypothesis is supported by preclinical studies in test animals showing that direct injection of Ad-ISF35 into tumor nodules is safe and capable of inducing antitumor responses. Thus, we conducted a first-in-man phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate toxicity, tolerability, and safety of Ad-ISF35 intranodal direct injection (IDI) in patients with CLL. Patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki to participate in this study. We enrolled and treated 15 patients who met the eligibility criteria, including diagnosis of CLL and progressive disease (PD) requiring treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL; refs.). All patients were offered standard chemoimmunotherapy but declined this treatment in favor of participating in this study. Patients presented at least one single accessible and palpable lymph node in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal regions. The size of the lymph nodes was larger than 2 x 2 cm in the horizontal and perpendicular axes. Additional inclusion criteria were hemoglobin >=10 g/dL, platelet count >=50 x 103/mm3 , total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine <=2x ULN (upper limit of normal), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <=2, and anticipated survival of at least 3 months. Patients were excluded from participating in this clinical trial if they had received treatment with chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies within 28 days before entering the study. Additional treatments for CLL were not allowed during the time of participation in this trial. In addition, patients with history of secondary malignancies within 5 years of registration were excluded from the protocol (except for patients with history of treated non-melanoma skin cancer). The study used a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 dose cohorts to receive one IDI of 1 x 1010, 3.3 x 1010, 1x1011, or 3.3 x 1011 viral particles (vp) of Ad-ISF35 (provided by Memgen, LLC). The injected node was in the axilla and greater than 2 x 2 cm in size before injection. The study design was reviewed and approved by the U.S. ',\n"," \"Food and Drug Administration (BB-IND 13046), the Recombinant Advisory Committee (RAC) of the NIH (Bethesda, MD), the University of California San Diego (UCSD, La Jolla, CA) Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and the UCSD Institutional Review Board. This clinical trial was registered in the NIH database (registration NCT00783874; ref.). We evaluated the patient's white blood cell counts (WBC), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), platelet counts (plt), hemoglobin (Hb), and size of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes before and at designated times after Ad-ISF35 IDI. The follow-up period included frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations on days 0,1, 2, 7,14, 21, 30, 60, and 84 after injection and every 3 months thereafter for a total of 1 year. Assessment of response to treatment was evaluated following the IWCLL guidelines. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any adverse event grade 3 or higher that was considered by the investigator to be possibly related or related to Ad-ISF35 treatment. DLTs were evaluated only during the first 21 days of treatment and their assessment determined dose escalation and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, modified for hematologic toxicities according to the IWCLL guidelines. Hematologic adverse events were considered DLT if they were grade 4 or higher and lasted 7 days or more. We defined the MTD as the highest dose where no more than one patient of 6 presented DLTs. Ten million of isolated WBCs/mL in PBS (+1% FBS) were incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs specific for CD5, CD19, CD54, CD80, CD86, CD20, DR5, CD3, CD4, CD8, mCD154 (used for detection of ISF35 protein expression), CD95, CD23 and kappa- or lambda-immunoglobulin light chain (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flow-Jo software (Tree Star Inc.). We examined serum samples for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TNF-alpha, granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IFN-gamma via Luminex xMAP technology following manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Luminex 100TM IS machine and BeadView Multiplex software v1.0 was used for data analysis by Spline curve-fitting method. We measured serum antibodies against Ad-ISF35 or recombinant human CD154 (rhCD154) protein by ELISA. \",\n"," \"Plates were coated with 4 x 109 vp/mL of Ad-ISF35 or 2 microg/mL of rhCD154 (R&D Systems) for 2 hours at 37 C. Plates were blocked with PBS/Tween 0.01%, bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1%. Sera samples collected on days 0 and 28 were added at different dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was added at 1:5,000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS-Tween 0.01%, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added, and reaction was stopped by adding 1N phosphoric acid. Optical densities were obtained in a SpectraMax250 plate reader (Molecular Devices). EC50 of each the serum was calculated with GraphPad Prism 4.0. Serial dilutions of serum samples were preincubated with 4 x 108 vp/mL of Ad-ISF35 for 10 minutes at 37 C. Then, the serum samples were added to 2 x 104 HeLa cells in 96-well plates for 24 hours at 37 C. HeLa cells were incubated with PBS-EDTA enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Gibco) for 10 minutes at 37 C and then incubated with 2 microL of antimouse CD154 and phycoerythrin-labeled (BD Pharmigen) for 30 minutes at 4 C. Fluorescence data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analysis was carried out using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Antibody neutralization activity was assessed by decrease in ISF35 (protein encoded by Ad-ISF35) expression in HeLa cells cultured with Ad-ISF35 preincubated with serum dilutions compared with the control cells incubated with Ad-IS35 without serum. Neutralizing activity was defined as at least 2-fold increase compared with pretreatment sample. We used a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that could detect 5 DNA copies or more of Ad-ISF35 in 100 ng of genomic DNA All the samples were tested in duplicate with a cycle threshold (Ct) variability that was less than 5% for Ad-ISF35 amplification. The following primers were used for Ad-ISF35 amplification (400 nmol/L): forward, 5'CCT CTG GCT GAA GCC CAG 3'; reverse, 5'CTC CCA AGT GAA TGG ATT GT 3'. MGB-FAM probe 5'TTACTCAAGGCGGCAAA3' was used at 250 nmol/L. The PCR reaction was carried out using TaqMan qPCR Universal Master Mix w/UNG from Applied Biosystems. The qPCR program used was 95 C for 3 minutes; 40 cycles: 95 C for 20 seconds, 52 C for 1 minute; and 20 seconds in Bio-Rad cycler iQ5 PCR machine. beta-Actin was used to monitor DNA quality. \",\n"," 'To calculate the Ad-ISF35 DNA copies present in given sample of DNA or cDNA, we used a standard curve with viral DNA ranging from 5 x 107 to 5 x 1010 viral copies. We used the IFN-gamma ELISPOT plates from R&D Systems, Inc. T cells from pre- and posttreatment (showing the highest number of CD8+ cells) from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated with Dynabeads against CD4 and CD8 (Invitrogen). CLL cells (5 x 106) from pretreatment samples (depleted of CD4 and CD8) were cultured for 24 hours with HeLa cells expressing CD154 (4 x 105) in 12-well plates. CLL cells were removed from cocultures and added into empty wells for 2 hours to allow floating HeLa-CD154 cells to reattach to the plate. CLL cells were washed and incubated with mitomycin C (60microg/mL) for 1 hour at 37 C. Activation of CLL cells was confirmed by flow cytometry measuring the upregulation of CD54 and CD95 markers. A total of 1 x 105 CLL nonactivated (CD4- and CD8-depleted) or CLL CD154-activated cells were cultured for 48 hours with 1x105 T cells plus L-2 (25 IU/mL). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic and baseline characteristics, clinical response variables, immunologic variables, and toxicity data. Univariate analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA with pre- and posttreatment values. HRs were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. All analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v4.0 and JMP v8.0. Five females and 10 males with a median age of 56 years (45-73 years) were enrolled in this study. The median leukemia cell doubling time for all patients was 3.3 months (0.9-22.5 months). The median number of prior treatments was 2 (0-7). Two patients were refractory to fludarabine-based treatment. CLL cells expressed unmutated Ig heavy chain variable region genes (IgVH) in 7 patients and ZAP-70 in 9 patients. Six patients had leukemia cells with adverse cytogenetics, 4 with deletions at 11q, and 2 with deletions at 17p (Table 1). All patients received Ad-ISF35 IDI. Only 2 of 15 patients did not complete the postinjection observation period of 84 days due to disease progression. The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions and systemic flu-like symptoms. Four patients had transient grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. One of these patients in cohort 2 presented grade 3 neutropenia that lasted for 6 days. ',\n"," 'This was not considered as DLT as the adverse event was not grade >= 4 and the duration was less than 7 days. In cohort 3, the first 3 patients did not present any DLTs. In cohort 4, 3 patients were enrolled, 2 of them presented DLTs including hypophosphatemia (grade 3 and 4) and AST elevation (grade 3). Because of this, we proceeded to enroll 3 additional patients in cohort 3 (3E). One patient presented with neutropenia grade 4 (not considered DLT as it lasted only 5 days) and one patient with hypophosphatemia grade 3 (considered DLT; Table 2). All adverse effects were subclinical and self-limiting. With these data, we defined cohort 3 dose (1 x 1011 vp) as the MTD. In addition, we have not observed long-term adverse effects associated with Ad-ISF35 IDI after a median follow-up of 2.5 years. We monitored the presence Ad-ISF35 DNA and ISF35 (protein encoded by Ad-ISF35 vector) expression in PBMCs collected before and after Ad-ISF35 IDI. For detection of Ad-ISF35 DNA, we used a sensitive qPCR assay capable of detecting 5 copies of Ad-ISF35 DNA in 100 ng of genomic DNA (gDNA). Ad-ISF35 was detected in only 3 patients 8 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI. Each of these patients had PBMCs with less than 9 copies of Ad-ISF35 per 100 ng of gDNA. Ad-ISF35 DNA was not detected at later time points (Fig. 1A). ISF35 protein surface expression was measured by flow cytometry. The results did not show detectable expression of ISF35 protein on the PBMCs of any patient at any time point (data not shown). Most patients (n = 14) experienced transient increases in platelet counts at day 7 and 14. None of the patients developed worsening anemia after injection (Fig. 1B). Also, we observed changes in T cells in the majority of patients enrolled in this study. During the first 48 hours, most patients (n = 11) had a transient fall in ALC (Fig. 1C) and absolute T-cell counts (Fig. 1D). The acute drop in T-cell counts was significant when compared with baseline levels in both cell subsets (CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ cells; P < 0.05). However, the majority of patients (n = 10) later showed an increase of T cells ranging from 6% to 311% during the first 4 weeks after Ad-ISF35 IDI. ',\n"," 'We observed that the majority of patients experienced an increase in ANC during the first 2 days following Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 1D). We observed systemic biologic responses to Ad-ISF35 IDI in most patients. In particular, we observed statistically significant upregulation of CD95, CD20, and HLAI during the first 48 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 1E). Such phenotypic changes are similar to those of CLL cells cocultured with CD154-bearing cells in vitro. We also noted that levels of IFN-g and IL-6 in the sera of 11 of 14 patients increased 1 day after Ad-ISF35 IDI relative to pretreatment levels. The relative increase in serum IFN-g appeared proportionate to the administered dose of Ad-ISF35 (linear trend analysis, P = 0.0328, r2 = 0.35); patients in cohorts 3 and 4 had the highest posttreatment serum levels of IFN-gamma (Fig. 2A). We evaluated whether cytokines or other factors present in the serum of patients who received Ad-ISF35 IDI were responsible for the phenotypic changes observed in circulating leukemic cells. CLL cells were cultured with autologous serum samples collected before and 1 day after Ad-ISF35 IDI. As a control, the same CLL cells were stimulated by coculture with CD154-bearing cells (HeLa-CD154). The expression levels of surface immune costimulatory molecules and death receptors were evaluated via flow cytometry. CLL cells cultured with sera collected before or after Ad-ISF35 IDI did not induce increased expression of these surface antigens. In contrast, CLL cells cocultured with HeLa-CD154 expressed higher levels of CD95 or immune costimulatory molecules than CLL cells cocultured with wild-type HeLa (Fig. 2B). Samples collected before and after Ad-ISF35 IDI from 4 patients were evaluated by ELISPOT assay to detect IFN-gamma production from T cells in response to coculture with CD40-stimulated autologous CLL cells. In these patients, we did not observe significant increase in the levels of T-cell/IFN-gamma production after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Supplementary Fig. S1). We evaluated for antibodies specific for adenovirus or human CD154 (hCD154). Sera collected from patients before Ad-ISF35 IDI had median titer of anti-adenovirus antibodies of 352 [confidence interval (CI), 173-531]. However, sera collected 1 month after therapy had significantly higher titers (median, 622; CI, 151-1,093; P < 0.05). Except for patient #10, the antiadenovirus antibodies induced by Ad-ISF35 IDI did not neutralize the capacity of adenovirus to infect HeLa cells in vitro (Table 3). None of the patients developed detectable antibodies to human CD154. ',\n"," 'Although Ad-ISF35 IDI was injected into a single axillary lymph node, we observed systemic clinical responses. The magnitude of these responses did not appear to have a clear dose-response relationship. Considering the best response during 84 days after Ad-ISF35 IDI, 87%, 80%, and 53% of patients had respective reductions in lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or ALC by more than 50% (Fig. 3A). The response observed in spleen and lymph nodes was durable during the course of the study (Fig. 3B). Three patients achieved partial response (PR), 7 patients had stable disease (SD), and 5 had PD by IWCLL criteria (refs.; Table 1). Six patients (patients 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, and 15) had durable responses (median, 8.8 months) and did not require additional treatment for over 6 months. Two of these patients (patients 2 and 5) did not require additional treatment for over a year after Ad-ISF35 IDI. The median time to next treatment (TNTx) for all patients was 5 months. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine hazard ratios (HR) comparing the duration of response (>=6 months), with variables such as number of prior therapies (<=1), ZAP-70 (<=20% positive cells), B2M levels (<=2.5 mg/L), IgG levels (<=500 mg/dL), splenomegaly (<=5 cm), and bidimensional lymph node product (total <=70 cm2). This analysis showed that only the number of prior therapies (<=1) had a statistically significant correlation with the duration of response (HR, 0.1491; CI, 0.04071-0.5464; P = 0.0041; Table 4). Therefore, patients who had no more than one prior treatment for CLL were 6.7 times more likely to have a durable response (TNTx >= 6 months). We examined the safety of gene immunotherapy using Ad-ISF35 IDI in patients with CLL. The injection of Ad-ISF35 into an axillary lymph node was safely delivered and without long-term adverse effects. Most of adverse effects were anticipated and of low-grade (grade 1 or 2). These included flu-like symptoms and erythema or pain at the site of injection. Such adverse effects have been observed in patients injected with adenovirus vectors directly into tumor nodules and most likely represent an inflammatory response to adenovirus infection/transduction. Many of the adverse events noted in this study also were similar to those observed in patients infused with autologous CLL cells transduced ex vivo with Ad-mCD154 or Ad-ISF35. ',\n"," 'In these ex vivo studies, patients who received the highest dose of transduced cells generally had a higher incidence of grade 2 versus grade 1 adverse events. We observed a similar dose relationship in patients receiving the 2 higher doses of Ad-ISF35, suggesting that there might be a relationship between the injected dose of Ad-ISF35 and frequency or intensity of adverse events. We observed grade 3/4 neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and AST elevation in 6 patients treated in cohorts 2, 3E, and 4. In 3 of these patients (n = 2 in cohort 4 and n = 1 in cohort 3E), hypophosphatemia and AST elevation were considered DLTs and thus defined the MTD as 1 x 1011 vp (cohort 3 dose). All the adverse events observed were subclinical and transient. The grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia observed could be related to increased serum levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 during the first 24 hours following Ad-ISF35 IDI. Hypophosphatemia has been associated with high serum levels of such inflammatory cytokines in patients with sepsis and in mice injected with IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-1beta. Some patients in the cohorts that received the higher doses also experienced transient elevations in serum hepatic transaminases. Although such transient and asymptomatic elevation of transaminases has been observed in patients who received i.v. injections of adenovirus vectors, the patient who had grade 3 elevation in AST elevation did not have detectable Ad-ISF35 in the blood. As such, it is conceivable that the transient elevations in hepatic transaminases instead could be associated with high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines could have been secreted in response to adenovirus infection as well as in response to CD40-CD154 stimulation. Several patients had decreased ALC and elevated ANC during the first 48 hours after Ad-ISF35 IDI, only to develop neutropenia 2 to 3 weeks later. Early increases in blood neutrophils associated with decreases in blood lymphocytes have been observed in mice infused with syngeneic dendritic cells stimulated by CD154 and IL-2 and pulsed with lymphoma antigens. Changes in ANC could be a direct response to modulation of the CD40-CD154 pathway as it has been observed in our mouse model and in patients with CD154 deficiency and hyper-IgM syndrome. On the other hand, neutropenia could be secondary to elevated levels of IFN-gamma and/or IL-6. Nevertheless, each patient recovered with no evidence of infection or other related complications. ',\n"," 'We observed fluctuation in T-cell counts after Ad-ISF35 IDI. Initially, during the first 48 hours after injection, the T cells decreased significantly and this could be in response to viral infection, cytokines, cell migration, or activation-induced cell death. At later time points, the majority of patients showed increase in T cells up to 300%, which was similar to what we have observed in previous studies using Ad-CD154. We studied whether T cells isolated after therapy were reactive against autologous CLL cells using ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma. However, in 4 patients available for evaluation, we did not observe reactivity of T cells against CD40-stimulated CLL cells. This finding is different than our previous experience in patients receiving ex vivo transduced autologous CLL cells with Ad-CD154. It is unclear the reasons for the lack of evidence of T-cell stimulation in response to AD-ISF35 IDI measured by IFN-gamma ELISPOT. Potential explanations could be the different route of administration (ex vivo vs. IDI), sample size, and time of analysis of the samples. Other immunemediated processes including microenvironment cell activation of macrophages could be responsible for the objective responses observed in some patients in this study. It is conceivable to hypothesize that multiple intranodal injections could enhance immunologic responses including T-cell reactivity against CLL antigens. We will address these mechanistic questions in future studies. We did not find evidence for Ad-ISF35 DNA in the PBMCs except in 3 patients, who had trace levels of detectable Ad-ISF35 DNA (close to the low-limit of sensitivity) 8 hours after injection. In addition, we did not detect expression of ISF35 protein on circulating CLL cells at any time following Ad-ISF35 IDI. Nevertheless, all patients experienced a systemic biologic response. We observed phenotypic changes in the circulating CLL cells that included expression of immune costimulatory molecules and death receptors. These changes were similar to those observed in vitro after leukemia cells are cultured with CD154-expressing cells. It is unlikely that the clinical and biologic activity observed after Ad-ISF35 IDI are mediated by direct transduction of cells distant from the injected lymph node. Our data in an A20 lymphoma mouse model have shown that after intratumoral injections, Ad-ISF35 is primarily found in tumor tissues with no evidence of accumulation or persistence in peripheral organs with a rapid virus clearance 24 hours after injection. ',\n"," 'In the same mouse model, we have detected the transduction not only in lymphoma cells but also in other important cells from the microenvironment such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells (manuscript in preparation). This suggests the possibility that phenotypic changes of microenvironment of cells may play a role in response to intratumoral Ad-ISF35 injection. Similarly, our data suggest that serum cytokines or other soluble factors are not entirely responsible for the phenotypic changes observed after Ad-ISF35 IDI (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the presence of systemic objective clinical response observed in conjunction with phenotypic changes and the lack of detectable Ad-ISF35 in circulating leukemia cells suggest that these effects are due to the stimulation generated by either contact with ISF35-bearing cells or other nontransduced activated cells, providing the so-called bystander-effect. Lymph node biopsies before and after Ad-ISF35 injection could have provided additional insight into this process. However, they were not conducted in this study to avoid additional local toxicities and adverse events that could interfere with the primary endpoint of this phase I study, which was to evaluate safety and tolerability. We are planning to conduct these biopsies in subsequent clinical trials. One concern was whether Ad-ISF35 IDI would induce autoantibodies reactive with hCD154. Such autoantibodies conceivably could induce adverse effects that are similar to those noted for some patients treated with antibodies specific for CD154. However, none of the patients developed antibodies reactive with hCD154. Nevertheless, 40% of treated patients were induced to increase their titers of antibodies of anti-adenovirus, indicating that Ad-ISF35 IDI could elicit an anti-adenovirus antibody response even in patients who have immune deficiency associated with CLL. Moreover, patients with CLL typically have hypogammaglobulinemia (median serum IgG levels in this study was 496 mg/dL) and typically respond poorly to administered vaccines. One of the treated patient also developed antibodies to adenovirus that could neutralize Ad-ISF35. It is uncertain whether the development of such antibodies can mitigate the activity of subsequent injections of Ad-ISF35. This will be evaluated in subsequent clinical studies examining the safety and activity of repeated administrations of Ad-ISF35 IDI. Although the primary purpose of the current study was to examine the safety of Ad-ISF35 IDI, we observed objective clinical responses in the majority of the patients treated. Patients experienced a 50% or more reduction in leukemia cell counts (7 of 15), lymphadenopathy (13 of 15), or splenomegaly (12 of 15). ',\n"," 'Six patients did not require additional treatment for 6 months or more and 3 patients achieved a PR. Moreover, responses achieved in the spleen and lymph nodes were durable and the majority of patients requiring additional treatment did so because of persistent lymphocytosis. This suggests that Ad-ISF35 can promote changes in the microenvironment of lymph nodes and spleen that could translate into a clinical benefit. Further studies to corroborate these observations are needed. Clinical responses in CLL can be compartmentalized. Patients can have excellent reduction of lymphocytosis but no response in large lymph nodes like in the case of patients treated with alemtuzumab, or good reduction in lymphadenopathy and spleen, but lack of response or lymphocytosis progression like in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the patients reported in this phase I study, we observed better and more durable responses in reduction of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Despite the fact that most patients had some degree of response (Fig. 3), only 3 of them fulfill all the criteria needed to achieve a clinical response based on the international guidelines. Previously untreated patients or those with less than one previous treatment showed the best clinical responses to Ad-ISF35 IDI (almost 7 times more likely to have durable responses). This supports the notion that early immunologic intervention in patients with CLL could result in better clinical outcomes. Although whether prior treatment with drugs or agents that suppress immune function mitigates the activity of Ad-ISF35 IDI needs to be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials. In summary, this first-in-man phase I clinical study shows that gene immunotherapy using Ad-ISF35 IDI is feasible and safe. We defined the dose of 1 x 1011 vp per injection as the MTD. Even though the study was designed to determine safety and tolerability of a single Ad-ISF35 IDI, we also observed systemic biologic and clinical effects. This is despite the fact that we could not detect expression of ISF35 protein in mononuclear cells isolated from the blood of patients following Ad-ISF35 IDI. This suggests that such responses were due to a bystander-effect in which leukemia cells are induced to undergo phenotypic changes when in contact with ISF35-bearing cells or other nontransduced activated cells. ',\n"," 'Our results also indicate that Ad-ISF-35 IDI-induced antibody, cytokine responses, and changes in the phenotype of circulating CLL cells that are consistent with immune activation similar to that induced by i.v. administration of autologous Ad-ISF35-transduced CLL cells. This suggests a greater interchange of cells between the blood, spleen, and lymphoid compartments of patients with CLL. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study conducted in patients with CLL showing that direct intratumoral/intranodal modulation by an immune-based strategy can result in clinical activity. This argues that the tumor microenvironment is a relevant target in this disease. ',\n"," \"In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P = 0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.) Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a variable natural history that is partly predicted by clinical and genomic features. Therapy for CLL has evolved from monotherapy with alkylating agents to chemoimmunotherapy. Each of the combination regimens has shown prolonged rates of progression- free survival, as compared with similar regimens that do not contain antibodies. Treatment of patients with relapsed CLL often includes regimens such as bendamustine and rituximab, ofatumumab, or investigational agents. \",\n"," \"Ofatumumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency on the basis of a single-group study involving patients who had resistance to fludarabine and alemtuzumab therapy; with an overall response rate of 58%, ofatumumab has been recommended in international consensus guidelines as a therapeutic option for patients with previously treated CLL. A short duration of response to initial therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities have been associated with a poor outcome among patients receiving conventional therapy. Identifying new therapies that prolong survival remains an important need for these patients. Ibrutinib (Imbruvica, Pharmacyclics and Janssen) is a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, an essential enzyme in B-cell receptor signaling, homing, and adhesion. On the basis of response rates in single-group, phase 2 studies, ibrutinib was recognized by the FDA as a breakthrough therapy and was granted accelerated approval for patients with mantle-cell lymphoma (in November 2013) and CLL (in February 2014) who had received at least one previous therapy. Among patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), those who received ibrutinib had a response rate of 71%, according to investigator assessment, and a progression-free survival rate of 75% at 2 years. In this study, drug toxicity did not result in the discontinuation of ibrutinib in most patients. On the basis of early results of the phase 2 trial, we initiated a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, the Study of Ibrutinib versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE), to compare once-daily oral ibrutinib with an active control single-agent therapy, ofatumumab, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL. Patients with CLL or SLL requiring therapy were eligible for enrollment if they had received at least one previous therapy and were considered to be inappropriate candidates for purine analogue treatment because they had a short progression-free interval after chemoimmunotherapy or because they had coexisting illnesses, an age of 70 years or more, or a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion (Text S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). \",\n"," 'an absolute neutrophil count of at least 750 cells per microliter, a platelet count of at least 30,000 cells per microliter, and adequate liver and kidney function. Patients requiring warfarin or strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors were excluded. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics and Janssen. All the authors and their research teams collected the data. Representatives of Pharmacyclics designed the study, confirmed the accuracy of the data, and compiled the data for analysis; Janssen representatives had no active role in the study. The authors had full access to the data and analyses for the compilation of this report. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript, which was reviewed, modified, and approved in its final version by all the authors. Editorial assistance was provided by two professional medical editors funded by Pharmacyclics. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org) and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. An independent review committee, whose members were unaware of study-group assignments and lymphocyte counts, assessed progression and response. An independent data and safety monitoring committee evaluated safety and reviewed data from the protocol-specified interim analysis. From June 2012 through April 2013, we enrolled 391 patients at 67 sites in the United States, Australia, and seven European countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral ibrutinib (at a dose of 420 mg once daily) until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects or intravenous ofatumumab for up to 24 weeks at an initial dose of 300 mg at week 1, followed by a dose of 2000 mg weekly for 7 weeks and then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, consistent with local labeling. Patients were stratified according to whether they had resistance to purine analogue chemoimmunotherapy (defined as no response or a relapse within 12 months after the last dose of a purine analogue) and whether they had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. ',\n"," 'During this study, promising data from the phase 2 trial led investigators to request, and the steering committee to recommend, crossover of patients in the ofatumumab group to the ibrutinib group. This revision was supported by the data and safety monitoring committee and was discussed with health authorities. Approximately 4 months after the last patient underwent randomization, a protocol amendment allowed patients in the ofatumumab group who had disease progression, as confirmed by an independent review committee, to receive ibrutinib. The primary end point was the duration of progression- free survival, as assessed by the independent review committee, according to the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. (Details regarding criteria for a complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.) On the basis of a clarification adopted in 2012, treatment-related lymphocytosis was not considered to be progressive disease. Key secondary end points included the duration of overall survival and the response rate. The criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia require the use of computed tomography (CT) to evaluate response and persistent improvement for at least 2 months to confirm response. Patients were monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks, every 4 weeks until month 6, and then every 12 weeks, with full response assessments performed every 12 weeks. Toxicity was graded according to the criteria of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0; the criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia were used to evaluate hematologic toxicity. Reports of eye-related adverse events were collected proactively on the basis of preclinical toxicology studies in dogs that revealed corneal abnormalities in animals receiving ibrutinib at a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (equivalent dose in humans, 81 mg per kilogram per day). Pathologists at a central laboratory assessed the results of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate cytogenetic factors (a procedure that was also performed at local site laboratories), measurements of serum beta2-microglobulin, and mutational analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes. (The presence of unmutated genes is usually associated with a poorer response to therapy and a worse outcome.) The primary end point, progression-free survival, was used in the calculation of the study sample size. ',\n"," \"The number of required events was based on a target hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.60, as calculated with the use of a two-sided log-rank test at an alpha level of 0.05, with a study power of at least 90%. The efficacy boundary (two-sided P<0.028) was crossed at the preplanned interim analysis, and the results from that analysis are presented in this report. The primary analysis was a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to the presence or absence of the chromosome 17p13.1 deletion and the disease refractory status at randomization. The type I error was controlled through adjustment of the significance level with the use of the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for the interim analysis and with the use of a hierarchical closed-testing procedure for primary and ordered secondary end points. The baseline characteristics of the patients were generally well balanced between the two study groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The majority of patients had advanced- stage disease. Patients in the ibrutinib group had undergone a median of three previous therapies, and those in the ofatumumab group had undergone a median of two previous therapies. The majority of patients had received previous treatment with purine analogues, alkylating agents, and anti-CD20 antibodies, which were frequently administered in combination. The percentage of patients with bulky disease (>=5 cm) was higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (64% vs. 52%). Approximately 57% of the patients in the two study groups had a deletion at either chromosome 17p13.1 or chromosome 11q22.3. The median follow-up time was 9.4 months (range, 0.1 to 16.6), and 86% of patients were still receiving ibrutinib at the time of this analysis (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged the duration of progression-free survival, with the median not reached at a median follow-up of 9.4 months, as compared with a median duration of progression-free survival of 8.1 months with ofatumumab. The hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group was 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.32; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). This represents a 78% reduction in the risk of progression or death among patients treated with ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab. At 6 months, 88% of patients in the ibrutinib group were still alive with no disease progression, as compared with 65% in the ofatumumab group. \",\n"," \"The effect of ibrutinib on progression-free survival was observed regardless of baseline clinical characteristics or molecular features (Fig. 2). Among patients with a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, the median duration of progression-free survival was not reached in the ibrutinib group, as compared with a median of 5.8 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.45). At 6 months, 83% of the patients with this deletion in the ibrutinib group, as compared with 49% of those with this deletion in the ofatumumab group, were alive with no disease progression. Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into an aggressive, rapidly growing large-cell lymphoma) was confirmed in two patients in each study group. Prolymphocytic leukemia developed in an additional patient in the ibrutinib group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly prolonged the rate of overall survival (hazard ratio for death in the ibrutinib group, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.79; P = 0.005), with the risk of death reduced by 57% (Fig. 1B). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. At the time of this analysis, 57 patients in the ofatumumab group had crossed over to receive ibrutinib after confirmed disease progression. The survival effect was based on an analysis in which data were censored at the time of crossover. At 12 months, the survival effect was also observed in the uncensored sensitivity analysis (hazard ratio for death, 0.39; P = 0.001), with an overall survival rate of 90% in the ibrutinib group and 79% in the ofatumumab group (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The difference in overall survival supporting the superiority of ibrutinib was preserved in all the subgroups defined according to pretreatment and genetic features (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The independently assessed response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (Fig. 3A). Overall, 43% of the patients in the ibrutinib group had a partial response, as compared with 4% in the ofatumumab group (odds ratio, 17.4; 95% CI, 8.1 to 37.3; P<0.001). In addition, 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib had a partial response with lymphocytosis (resulting in a 63% response rate). Lymphocytosis was observed in 69% of the patients who were treated with ibrutinib and was not considered to be disease progression. \",\n"," 'The condition resolved in 77% of these patients during follow-up. In a recent study, patients with a partial response with lymphocytosis had rates of progression-free survival that were similar to those in patients with a partial response. Investigator- assessed response rates were higher than independently assessed response rates in the two study groups (Fig. 3B). Treatment exposure was longer among patients receiving ibrutinib than among those receiving ofatumumab (median duration, 8.6 months [range, 0.2 to 16.1] vs. 5.3 months [range, 0 to 7.4]). The profiles of cumulative adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of the patients are presented without adjustment for duration of exposure in Table 2. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events that occurred in at least 20% of the patients were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Overall, 57% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and 47% of the patients in the ofatumumab group had at least one adverse event of grade 3 or higher. Serious adverse events are summarized in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred more frequently in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group included diarrhea (4% vs. 2%) and atrial fibrillation (3% vs. 0%); the latter event required cessation of therapy in one patient. An additional four patients in the ibrutinib group and one patient in the ofatumumab group had grade 1 or 2 atrial fibrillation. Bleeding-related adverse events of any grade (most commonly, petechiae, and including ecchymoses) were more common in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (44% vs. 12%). Major hemorrhage (any hemorrhagic event of grade 3 or higher or resulting in transfusion of red cells or in hospitalization) was reported in two patients (1%) in the ibrutinib group (including one patient with a subdural hematoma) and three patients (2%) in the ofatumumab group. Other adverse events that were more commonly noted among patients receiving ibrutinib than among those receiving ofatumumab included rash (8% vs. 4%), pyrexia (24% vs. 15%), and blurred vision (10% vs. 3%); all these events were generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. The incidence of cataracts was 3% and 1%, respectively. ',\n"," 'Infections of any grade were more common in the ibrutinib group (70% vs. 54%), whereas the frequency of infections of grade 3 or higher was similar in the two study groups (24% vs. 22%) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Infusion reactions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, urticaria, night sweats, and pruritus were more common in the ofatumumab group. Basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas were reported in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 2% in the ofatumumab group; nonskin cancers were seen in 3% and 1% of the patients, respectively. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events occurred in 4% of the patients in each study group. Fatal events occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 5% of those in the ofatumumab group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). These events were most commonly infectious in nature. Adverse events resulting in dose reductions occurred in 4% of the patients treated with ibrutinib, with only diarrhea (which occurred in three patients) leading to a dose reduction in more than one patient. Changes in creatinine levels from baseline were similar in the two study groups, with a decrease in creatinine clearance of any grade observed in 16% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 17% of those in the ofatumumab group. Among patients with relapsed CLL or SLL, including those who had a short duration of response to prior therapy or who had adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, ibrutinib was superior to ofatumumab with respect to progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate at a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The positive effect of ibrutinib was observed in subgroups of patients with a high-risk chromosome 17p13.1 deletion and with resistance to previous purine analogue therapy. Similar benefits with respect to progression-free survival were observed regardless of age, clinical stage, and factors such as status with respect to mutations in IGHV. The effect of ibrutinib on overall survival was significant, an effect that was robust despite the crossover of 57 patients to the ibrutinib group after they had disease progression while receiving ofatumumab; this effect was also observed in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Except for a few differences, our findings are largely similar to those of other trials of ibrutinib or ofatumumab. ',\n"," 'In each of the two groups in our study, the response rate as determined by independent assessors was lower than the response rate as determined by investigators. In the phase 2 study of ibrutinib monotherapy, in which response was assessed by investigators, the response rate was 71%, which is similar to the 70% response rate assessed by investigators in our study. The independently assessed response rate in the ofatumumab group in our study appears to be lower than that in the pivotal study that was based on 1996 National Cancer Institute guidelines for CLL, which did not require CT scanning to confirm response. This difference may be due in part to the requirement in our study for serial CT scanning, which was performed every 12 weeks, to confirm response. Another ofatumumab study that compared response assessment between patients who underwent CT scanning and those who did not undergo CT scanning showed substantial differences in the rates of response between the two subgroups, with lower response rates seen in the group that underwent CT scanning. Furthermore, the investigator-assessed response rate among patients in the ofatumumab group in our study (21%) was similar to the rate (23%) in a recent study that used 2008 criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Reassuringly, the results with respect to progression-free survival in the ofatumumab group in our study (median, 8.1 months) are similar to those in historical reports (median, approximately 6 months). Previous reports of ofatumumab therapy showed that patients with refractory CLL had a median survival of 12 months and 15 months, with no plateau in deaths. With a median follow- up of 9.4 months in our study, an early separation in the curves for overall survival favored ibrutinib; however, the median was not reached in either study group. At later time points, the survival curve for ofatumumab began to flatten, which may in part be a reflection of the influence of ibrutinib on patients in the ofatumumab group who crossed over to ibrutinib therapy. Ibrutinib was associated with toxic effects that were expected on the basis of the results of phase 2 studies. It appears that the drug can be safely administered even in a heavily pretreated and elderly population with baseline coexisting conditions, such as the one in our study. ',\n"," 'In the ibrutinib group, 32% of the patients had a decreased creatinine clearance, 64% had cytopenias, and 32% had a score on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale of more than 6 (ranging from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating worse health status). Toxic effects did not result in frequent dose reductions or treatment discontinuations. One strength of a randomized, controlled trial is that background disease-related complications may be differentiated from a treatment effect with a new agent. However, it is important to note that patients in the ibrutinib group had a reporting period for adverse events that was more than 3 months longer than that in the ofatumumab group (median duration, 8.6 months vs. 5.3 months), and no exposure-adjusted analysis of adverse events was performed. The frequencies of renal complications and increased creatinine levels were similar in the two study groups. Although the overall rate of infections was higher in the ibrutinib group, the frequency of infections of grade 3 or higher did not differ significantly between the two groups. Ocular symptoms were collected proactively and were reported more frequently among patients in the ibrutinib group, including a small proportion of patients who reported blurred vision. The development of cataracts in 3% of the patients receiving ibrutinib (as compared with 1% in the control group) bears noting, since longer exposure may be associated with an increased risk. Atrial fibrillation of any grade was noted in 10 patients in the ibrutinib group, as compared with 1 patient in the ofatumumab group, and led to the discontinuation of ibrutinib in 1 patient. Potential reasons for the higher rate of atrial fibrillation among patients receiving ibrutinib are being explored. In clinical studies in which serial electrocardiographic studies were performed, no evidence of arrhythmias was observed among patients receiving ibrutinib. An adverse event of interest with ibrutinib from early studies was major hemorrhage, including subdural hematoma. In our study, we excluded patients requiring warfarin but not those requiring other forms of anticoagulation. The rate of major hemorrhage was similar in the two study groups, with one subdural hematoma noted in a patient receiving ibrutinib. Although mild bleeding episodes were more common in the ibrutinib group, adherence to appropriate drug-withholding guidelines perioperatively and precautions regarding the use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants resulted in no unexpected major bleeding complications in the ibrutinib group. ',\n"," \"Further studies of the mechanism of bleeding, including bruising, that was observed among patients receiving ibrutinib have been conducted or are planned. In conclusion, ibrutinib was superior to ofatumumab in difficult-to-treat patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, as measured by progression-free survival, overall survival, and response. The improvement was observed across all subgroups that were examined, including patients who were resistant to chemoimmunotherapy and those with a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, which confirms single-agent ibrutinib as an effective therapy for CLL or SLL. Phase 3 studies examining the effect of ibrutinib in previously untreated patients with CLL or SLL are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02048813 and NCT01722487).

A treatment-induced rise in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has emerged as a class effect of kinase inhibitors in CLL and warrants further investigation. We here report correlative studies in 64 patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. We quantified tumor burden in blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, assessed phenotypic changes of circulating cells, and measured whole blood viscosity. With just one dose of ibrutinib the average increase in ALC was 66%, and in over 40% of patients the ALC peaked within 24 hours of initiating treatment. Circulating CLL cells on day 2 showed increased Ki67 and CD38 expression, indicating an efflux of tumor cells from the tissue compartments into the blood. The kinetics and degree of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable; interestingly in patients with a high baseline ALC the relative increase was mild and resolution rapid. After two cycles of treatment the disease burden in lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen decreased irrespective of the relative change in ALC. Whole blood viscosity was dependent on both ALC and hemoglobin. No adverse events were attributed to the lymphocytosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a malignancy of mature B-cells that involves blood, bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, is the most common leukemia in western countries. In the US alone ~120 000 people live with CLL, while an estimated 15 680 people will be newly diagnosed with, and 4 580 will die of CLL in 2013. Median survival with early stage disease is 10.7 years; however, the clinical course is quite heterogeneous, depending on prognostic markers like Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Variable (IGHV) gene mutation status, ZAP70 expression, deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) or presence of SF3B1 and NOTCH1 mutations. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has emerged as a key pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL. A role for antigenic stimulation of the clonal cells was first indicated by the observation that CLL cells use a restricted repertoire of IGHV genes that encode the antigen interacting interface of the BCR. More recently, the discovery of BCR stereotypes shared by a substantial proportion of CLL cases, suggests that CLL cells may arise from B-cells with defined antigen specificities. BCR signaling and activation of the NF-kappaB pathway occur primarily in the lymph node microenvironment promoting cell growth, proliferation, and survival. ',\n"," \"Thus, antigenic stimulation emerges as a driving pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL; a mechanism that is also implicated in an increasing number of mature B-cell malignancies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is recruited early in the BCR signaling cascade in conjunction with SYK and PI3Kdelta. BTK couples BCR activation to intracellular calcium release and activation of NF-kappaB and is essential for normal B-cell development and response of B-cells to antigenic stimulation. Knockdown of BTK is lethal to select lymphoma cell lines derived from activated B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and decreases the viability of primary CLL cells. In addition, genetic ablation of BTK inhibits disease progression in mouse models of CLL. Ibrutinib, an orally active agent, covalently binds to Cys-481 of BTK thereby irreversibly inactivating the kinase. In the phase I study, ibrutinib was well tolerated and active across a spectrum of mature B-cell malignancies, with the highest response rates in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). More recently, overall response rates of >70%, and an estimated 26 month progression free survival rate of 75% for previously treated patients with CLL was reported. In vitro ibrutinib has been shown to inhibit proliferation, adhesion and migration of CLL cells. Further, murine CLL models suggest that ibrutinib inhibits homing of CLL cells to tissue sites. In addition to ibrutinib, several other inhibitors of kinases in the BCR pathway are in clinical development. Initial clinical experience with such BCR inhibitors raised concerns due to a sometimes dramatic worsening of peripheral lymphocytosis, which is now recognized as a class effect. Concerns about patient safety due to the treatment-induced lymphocytosis have been somewhat alleviated by the increasing experience with these agents in clinical trials. However, many questions remain. Here we focused on the kinetics and inter-individual variability in treatment-induced lymphocytosis, characterized changes in the immune-phenotype of circulating CLL cells on treatment, assessed concomitant changes in disease distribution in different anatomic compartments, and sequentially determined whole blood viscosity during the period of peak lymphocytosis. We found that the ibrutinib induced lymphocytosis developed almost immediately after the first dose of drug, peaked within 24 hours in many patients, and showed pronounced inter-patient variability. We provide direct in vivo evidence that the initial rise in lymphocytosis is in large part due to the release of previously activated cells from the lymph node. \",\n"," 'drug, peaked within 24 hours in many patients, and showed pronounced inter-patient variability. We provide direct in vivo evidence that the initial rise in lymphocytosis is in large part due to the release of previously activated cells from the lymph node. Furthermore, substantial reductions in tumor burden in lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen independent of changes in the number of circulating CLL cells underscores the notion that in CLL patients treated with BCR inhibitors, the ALC is not a valid surrogate of overall disease burden or activity. We report correlative analyses on 64 CLL patients enrolled between January 2012 and October 2013 in our ongoing, investigator-initiated phase II study of ibrutinib (NCT01500733). The study was approved by the local ethics committee; informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory patients with either del(17p) or age >=65 years were eligible (Table 1) and treated with ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of intolerable side effects. Mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene was assessed as described and CLL with <2% mutations was classified as unmutated. Complete blood counts were determined in the NIH central laboratory. Groups of patients having distinct patterns of treatment-induced lymphocytosis (in regards to degree of change in ALC, and the kinetics of onset and resolution) were identified using hierarchical clustering (Eisen Laboratory, Stanford University, CA). Whole blood viscosity was determined by quantitative viscometry of whole blood (ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE v 4.03. Tumor volume in spleen and lymph node was computed from CT scans using syngovia software (Siemens, Cary, NC). Of the spleen volume, 70% was considered due to CLL cells. Bone marrow volume was calculated as previously published, and the content of CLL cells was calculated from the overall marrow cellularity multiplied by the degree of CLL cell infiltration. Cellular density was estimated at 109 cells/ml based on measurements of thymocyte density. Peripheral blood volume was calculated using the Nadler formula. The number of CLL cells was calculated based on measured ALC and the percentage of CD19+ cells among all lymphocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared by density-gradient centrifugation (Lymphocyte Separation Media; ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Lymph node derived single cell suspensions were obtained from core biopsies. ',\n"," \"Cell suspensions were stained as previously described (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For Ki67 staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 70% EtOH. To assess cell death fresh whole blood samples were collected, red cells were removed by ACK lysis, and CLL cell viability was assessed with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Cells were analyzed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACS-DIVA 6.1.1 and FlowJo software (Version 8.8.6; TreeStar, Ashland, OR). When comparing patient groups, a linear model was applied (JMP10 software, SAS Inc, Cary, NC). When comparing specific events among patient groups a Fisher's exact test was used. All other statistical analyses were by Student's T-test (Prism5, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). To test the hypothesis that the treatment-related increase in ALC is due to efflux of CLL cells from the lymph node, the predicted percentage of CLL cells expressing Ki67 (Ki67T PB) on day 2 was calculated from the change in ALC and the measured percentage of CLL cells expressing Ki67 pre-treatment in peripheral blood (KI67 PB pre) and lymph node (Ki67 LN pre):  Within 24 hours of initiating ibrutinib the mean baseline ALC of 105 000/muL increased on average by 66% (P<0.001) and continued to increase throughout the first cycle before it gradually declined (Figure 1a and b). Within four hours of starting treatment the mean ALC had already increased in most patients (data not shown). Thus, the onset of ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis was virtually immediate and in many patients reached its peak within days; in 46% of patients on day 2 and in 78% by day 28 (Figure 1c). The magnitude of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable between patients (Figure 1d), without any correlation to prior treatment history or the presence of absence of del(17p) (Supplementary Figure S1a-d). However, patients with IGHV mutated CLL showed a more pronounced rise in ALC that resolved more slowly than in patients with IGHV unmutated CLL (P<0.001; Supplementary Figure S1e-f). To test for factors that might predict distinct patterns of lymphocytosis, we used an unsupervised clustering analysis of the relative change in ALC over the first 6 months on treatment compared to baseline. Three separate clusters of patients that differ in the degree and the kinetics of the lymphocytosis were identified (Figure 2a-c). \",\n"," \"Notably, the pre-treatment ALC was significantly different between the three clusters (P<0.002, Figure 2d). The mean pre-treatment ALC was highest for patients in cluster 1 and in this group of patients the treatment-induced lymphocytosis peaked within days and resolved rapidly. Conversely, patients in cluster 3 tended to have lower pre-treatment ALC and showed a greater relative increase in lymphocytosis that developed and resolved more slowly. Compared to the other clusters, cluster 3 was enriched for patients having IGHV mutated CLL and bulky lymphadenopathy (at least one node with largest diameter >5 cm; Table 2). Conversely, patients in cluster 1 frequently had advanced Rai stage (80%). Thus, it appears that CLL patients with moderate lymphadenopathy may have a shorter time to peak ALC and a faster resolution of lymphocytosis, while bulky disease was here associated with more prolonged lymphocytosis. Notably, there was no significant difference in the degree of nodal response at 6 months among the three clusters (Table 2), suggesting that a prolonged lymphocytosis does not predict for inferior response; in agreement with a recent report by Woyach et al. We estimated a patient's total disease burden from the ALC, the extent of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly on CT scans, and the degree of bone marrow infiltration. Figure 3 summarizes data for four representative patients. The distribution of disease among the different anatomic compartments varied greatly between individual patients (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 1). During treatment, we repeatedly assessed the tumor burden in these sites for four patients chosen to represent cases with both diverse involvement of the four compartments pre-treatment and different kinetics of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis. The aggregate volume of lymphadenopathy as calculated from CT scans is shown for a representative patient in Figure 3b; ibrutinib reduced the pre-treatment lymph node volume of 3 161 mL (equal to an estimated 3.2x1012 CLL cells) by >80% within two months, with continued improvement at 6 months. Similarly, ibrutinib also rapidly reduced the tumor burden in the spleen (Figure 3c). The degree of bone marrow infiltration was estimated from anti-CD79a stained bone marrow biopsies (Figure 3d). Irrespective of the initial tumor distribution, all four representative patients showed a pronounced decrease in the number of CLL cells over time, with the most rapid decrease occurring during the first two months (Figure 3e). \",\n"," 'One patient showed an apparent increase in the total number of CLL cells at 2 months despite reductions in disease burden in all three tissue sites due to a pronounced increase in ALC. This likely reflects release of CLL cells from the liver and intestinal tract, sites known to be significant reservoirs of B-cells, but not included in our model. The substantial reduction in total tumor burden cannot be explained by mere disease redistribution between different anatomic sites and suggests that there is a substantial amount of treatment-induced cell death. For example in three of the four patients shown in Figure 3e trillions of CLL cells \"disappear\" within the first two months; and that is only from the four sites amenable to study. However, evidence of cell death has been elusive. For example none of the patients in our study showed signs of tumor lysis syndrome, and in ficolled, viably frozen PBMCs we failed to detect an increase in cell death or apoptosis. When we switched to analyzing fresh whole blood samples we found that pre-treatment a median 2.4% of the circulating tumor cells were dead or dying. On day 28 on ibrutinib the frequency of dead or dying cells in circulation on average more than doubled compared to pre-treatment (P=0.03; Figure 3f). In vitro and murine studies suggest that both inhibition of cell adhesion and homing of circulating cells to tissue sites may contribute to treatment-induced lymphocytosis in CLL. Based on the rapid onset of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis, we hypothesized that efflux of CLL cells from tissue sites fuels the rise in circulating cells. To distinguish CLL cells in circulation from tissue-resident cells we made use of prior observations that CLL cells are activated and proliferate in the tissue microenvironment, and the two populations therefore differ in their immuno-phenotypic characteristics (Figure 4a). Expression of activation markers, including CD38, CD69, and CD86, and the proliferation marker Ki67 have been found to be downregulated by BCR inhibitors. As expected we found downregulation of these markers on circulating tumor cells on day 14 of ibrutinib therapy (data not shown). However, on day 2 concurrent with the increase in ALC the frequency of CD38 and Ki67 positive CLL cells in circulation increased significantly (P<=0.004, Figure 4b-c, and Supplementary Figure S2a) consistent with an influx of tissue resident cells into the blood. ',\n"," 'Next we used the relative change in ALC and in the fraction of circulating cells expressing Ki67 on day 2 to estimate to what degree the influx of tissue resident cells can account for the rise in ALC. Figure 4d illustrates these changes in a representative patient. The fraction of Ki67 expressing CLL cells as measured by flow cytometry pre-treatment was 6.4% in the peripheral blood and 12.8% in the lymph node. On day 2 the ALC had increased from 90 000/ul to 128 000/ul. Thus one third of the cells on day 2 were \"additional cells\". If all these additional cells are derived from the lymph node, the frequency of Ki67 positive cells is predicted to increase to 8.3%. Indeed the actual frequency measured by flow cytometry was 8.2%. We could assess eight patients in this manner and consistently, actual and predicted frequency of Ki67 expressing cells were virtually identical (R=0.99, P<0.001; Figure 4e). Using this same formula, we could also predict the expected rise in ALC based on the pre-treatment and day 2 Ki67 values (R=0.99, P<0.001; Figure 4f). Thus, the treatment-induced rise in ALC on day 2 can be accounted for by the influx of lymph-node resident CLL cells into the blood. Patients with certain types of leukemia may develop leukostasis leading to central nervous system and respiratory impairment. CLL patients, even those with very high lymphocyte counts, are rarely reported to suffer such complications; however, the rapid increase in ALC and the release of more activated cells from tissue sites might contribute an additional risk. Fortunately, no adverse events were attributed to leukostasis or hyperviscosity syndrome in this study, where the highest ALC was 475 000/mul, and 42% of patients had an ALC greater than 200 000/mul at least once during the first two months. Prospectively measured whole blood viscosity pre-treatment and on days 2 and 28 correlated with ALC, but did so even more strongly with hemoglobin (P<0.001, Figure 5a and b). Overall, there was no significant increase in whole blood viscosity on treatment (Figure 5c). Only in two patients a slightly increased whole blood viscosity was recorded, in one patient on day 2 with an ALC of 405 000/mul and in the other on day 28 with an ALC of 388 000/mul. ALC and hemoglobin were inversely correlated and patients with high ALC tended to be more anemic (Supplementary Figure S3). ',\n"," 'Interestingly, in patients with a pre-treatment hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL there was a decrease in mean hemoglobin from 11.7 to 10.9 g/dL during the first 28 days on treatment (P <= 0.02, Figure 5d). Figure 5e illustrates the interaction of hemoglobin and ALC on whole blood viscosity. Notably, the effect of a high ALC may in part be offset by a degree of anemia. Treatment-induced lymphocytosis has become a hallmark of BCR inhibitors in CLL. Here we report clinical and biologic aspects of ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis in patients with CLL; we show that the rise in ALC is virtually immediate, driven by the efflux of cells from tissue compartments, and paralleled by a substantial decrease in total tumor burden. In prospective measurements of whole blood viscosity we identified a small subset of patients in whom whole blood viscosity can exceed the normal range. However, no clinical adverse events were attributed to the lymphocytosis. Prior studies have reported treatment-induced lymphocytosis with BCR inhibitors within weeks of initiating treatment. Here we show that the onset of lymphocytosis occurs within hours of the first dose of ibrutinib and identify a group of patients in whom the lymphocytosis peaks within the first days and resolves before the end of the first cycle. The variability in degree and kinetics of the ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis in our cohort appears to be somewhat more heterogeneous than seen in other studies. While we included both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory patients of all age groups, and a large proportion of patients having del(17p), none of these characteristics predicted kinetics or degree of lymphocytosis. Of practical consequence is the observation that patients with a high pre-treatment ALC tend to have a rapid but relatively modest rise in ALC followed by fast resolution of the leukemic disease. Conversely, the group of patients showing a slow but continuous rise in ALC also had slow resolution of leukemic disease, had lower ALC pre-treatment, a higher proportion of patients with bulky disease, and commonly had IGHV mutated CLL. Thus, patients in this group would be predicted to have a more indolent course and extended benefit of treatment, at least with conventional chemoimmunotherapy. Therefore, as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease in other sites, it seems appropriate to continue treatment and await the eventual resolution of the lymphocytosis. ',\n"," 'Overall, compared to patients with IGHV unmutated CLL patients with IGHV mutated CLL had a greater relative increase in ALC and slower resolution of lymphocytosis confirming an earlier report. While IGHV mutated patients may therefore have lower response rates by IWCLL criteria, Woyach et al. recently showed that patients with persistent lymphocytosis have a similar PFS compared to those who reach an IWCLL objective response within the first year. In accordance with this, we did not find a significant difference in the degree of nodal response at 6 months among the three clusters, further suggesting that a prolonged lymphocytosis does not indicate an inferior response. Resolution of lymphadenopathy concurrent with the rise in ALC has been a strong indication that treatment-induced lymphocytosis is not a sign of progressive disease but reflects redistribution of tumor cells between different anatomic compartments. Here we present for the first time direct evidence that the initial rapid rise in ALC is driven by the release of CLL cells from tissues, in particular from the lymph node. This conclusion is based on the increased frequency of CLL cells expressing Ki67 and CD38 in the blood within 24 hours of starting ibrutinib and supported by a mathematical model derived from in vivo measurements in both blood and lymph node resident cells (Figure 4d). At least in the first 24h the bulk of cells released into the blood appear to come from the lymph node but we cannot rule out that some cells also egress from the bone marrow or other tissue sites. While several markers have been reported to be differentially expressed between CLL cells in the blood and tissues, not all are suitable to assess shifts in cell populations on ibrutinib. For example the activation markers CD69 and CD86 are so rapidly downregulated by ibrutinib that they cannot identify different cell populations once treatment is initiated. In contrast, we observed an increase of CXCR4 expression on CLL cells during treatment with ibrutinib (data not shown), which precludes the identification of the CXCR4dim/CD5bright population reported by Calissano et al. Similarly, on continued treatment both Ki67 and CD38 are downregulated by BCR inhibitors. Therefore, we could not distinguish different cell populations at later time-points. ',\n"," 'Thus, while we show that an efflux of cells from the tissue into the blood accounted for the observed rise in ALC by day 2, we cannot asses to what degree reduced homing of CLL cells to the tissue may contribute to the persistence of the lymphocytosis. However, the latter mechanism may contribute to the drop in ALC during treatment interruptions as seen in early studies that cycled ibrutinib 4 weeks on, one week off. Leukostasis is a rarely reported complication of CLL. However, in some settings the treatment-induced worsening of lymphocytosis has raised concerns about patient safety. We therefore prospectively incorporated whole blood viscosity measurements. Clinically we did not observe any symptoms or signs suggestive of leukostasis. Further, whole blood viscosity was only slightly elevated in two patients. While our experience is limited in patients with ALC greater than 300 000, the positive correlation between ALC and whole blood viscosity suggests that blood flow may be altered at very high ALCs especially in patients with normal hemoglobin (Figure 5e). The fact that most patients with high ALC had hemoglobin <10 g/dL could in part account for their normal viscosity readings and may justify withholding administration of blood products in patients with high ALC. Treatment-induced lymphocytosis has attracted considerable attention. However, in most patients, the circulating CLL cells are only a minor fraction of the total tumor volume. Importantly, the bulk of the disease, located in tissue sites such as bone marrow, lymph node, spleen and likely the intestinal tract, is substantially decreased on ibrutinib (Figure 3). Also, 27% of patients already had a reduction in ALC below baseline by two weeks. Thus, in most patients there is a rapid reduction in total tumor burden indicating an increased rate of cell death on ibrutinib. In fresh whole blood samples obtained pre-treatment we identified a median 2.4% of the circulating tumor cells as dead or dying, which is within the range of the previously calculated daily death rates in untreated CLL patients using heavy water labeling. Our measurements suggest that the frequency of dead or dying cells in circulation more than doubled on ibrutinib (Figure 3f). As dead cells are constantly cleared through the reticuloendothelial system this is most consistent with an increased death rate. ',\n"," 'An absolute increase in the rate of cell death by 2% per day would result in a >50% reduction in tumor burden within 28 days, which is in good agreement with the initial kinetics of tumor response seen in many patients. In addition, inhibition of tumor proliferation by ibrutinib, as reported elsewhere, will prevent or reduce the replacement of the dying cells. A slow but steady decay rate of the tumor is also in accordance with the notable absence of reports of tumor lysis syndrome with single agent ibrutinib, and the modest degree of apoptosis induced by ibrutinib in vitro. As BCR inhibitors decrease NF-kappaB signaling and expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2A1, cell death may be a consequence of reduced pro-survival signaling rather than of a direct cytotoxic effect. However, this remains to be more fully evaluated. Ibrutinib is active in several mature B-cell malignancies. Notably, patients with MCL also frequently experience treatment-induced lymphocytosis. Although the mechanisms leading to redistribution of disease may be similar to those in CLL, patterns of lymphocytosis in MCL and their relation to clinical response and patient safety need to be independently studied. Results presented here support the positive benefit to risk profile of continued ibrutinib treatment for most patients with CLL showing treatment-induced lymphocytosis. In fact, treatment-induced lymphocytosis in CLL may be viewed as an on-target effect of BCR inhibitors, with the caveat that it may be missed as the peak can occur within the first days or even hours of starting ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) patients with purine analogue refractory disease or TP53 dysfunction still have limited treatment options and poor survival. Alemtuzumab containing chemoimmunotherapy regimens can be effective but frequently cause serious infections. We report a phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of a short duration regimen combining pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low dose high frequency rituximab (PAR) designed to decrease the risk of treatment associated infections and limit loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. The study enrolled 39 patients with progressive CLL that was either relapsed/refractory (n=36) or previously untreated with 17p13 deletion (17p13-)(n=3). Thirteen (33%) patients had both 17p13- and TP53 mutations predicted to be dysfunctional and eight patients had purine analogue refractory CLL without TP53 dysfunction. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed therapy with only five (13%) patients having treatment limiting toxicity, and no treatment related deaths. Twenty-two (56%) patients responded to treatment with 11 (28%) complete responses (four with incomplete bone marrow recovery). Median progression free survival was 7.2 months, time to next treatment 9.1 months, and overall survival 34.1 months. The majority of deaths (82%) were caused by progressive disease including transformed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n=6). Correlative studies showed that low dose rituximab activates complement and NK cells without a profound and sustained decrease in expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. We conclude that PAR is a tolerable and effective therapy for CLL and that low dose rituximab therapy can activate innate immune cytotoxic mechanisms without substantially decreasing CD20 expression. Patients with purine analogue refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and progressive disease with TP53 dysfunction have limited treatment options and poor survival. Although alemtuzumab monotherapy is often effective at clearing CLL cells in the circulation and bone marrow, patients with bulky adenopathy and splenomegaly rarely achieve durable responses. Alemtuzumab is also an effective therapy against CLL cells with TP53 dysfunction (deletion/mutation), although complete remissions are rare and progression free survival is usually short. Alemtuzumab has thus been combined with other drugs in order to improve efficacy. Alemtuzumab and rituximab is effective and tolerable but also has limited efficacy against bulky disease. Combination therapy with alemtuzumab and fludarabine has been reported to be more effective than fludarabine monotherapy but there are concerns about the safety of these chemoimmunotherapy regimens because of excess mortality for both patients undergoing their first therapy for progressive disease and those treated for relapsed/refractory disease. ',\n"," 'A safer and more effective chemoimmunotherapy regimen could be of value for patients with very high risk progressive CLL. We conducted a phase II clinical trial to test whether a combination therapy with pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and lower dose higher frequency rituximab (PAR) could be effective and tolerable for patients with relapsed/refractory or progressive CLL with 17p13 deletion (17p13-) and could limit loss of CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells. Pentostatin was included in the regimen with the aim of decreasing CLL tumor bulk by targeting the residual purine analogue sensitive clones of the CLL cell population with a drug that could have less myelotoxicity than fludarabine. The rituximab administration schedule was based on data showing that lower dose and higher frequency therapy can decrease the loss of CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells that occurs with standard dose rituximab therapy. The duration of the therapy regimen was limited to three months to reduce the risk of prolonged immunosuppression. Our study shows that PAR is an effective and tolerable therapy for this patient population and that use of low dose rituximab decreases trogocytosis (\"shaving\") and thus loss of expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. This two-stage phase II clinical trial was conducted at the Mayo Clinic Rochester and University of Iowa with the approval of both Institutional Review Boards according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00669318). Patients were eligible for accrual if they had a diagnosis of progressive CLL (including the small lymphocytic lymphoma variant) by standard criteria and either had been previously treated for CLL (no more than three purine analogue containing regimens) or were previously untreated for their CLL and had 17p13- detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Exclusion criteria were organ failure (creatinine >2x upper limit of normal (ULN), direct hyperbilirubinemia or AST >3x ULN, >class II New York Heart Association heart failure, or an ECOG performance status >3), infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C, active autoimmune cytopenia, and alemtuzumab therapy <2 months previously. Prognostic factor analysis was determined using FISH analysis of peripheral blood, IGHV mutation analysis, TP53 mutation analysis, and expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 as previously described. Therapy started with rituximab 20 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (M-W-F). ',\n"," 'second dose of rituximab with a daily dose escalation of 3-10-30 mg/d if tolerated and was then administered at 30 mg SQ M-W-F starting on day 8. Pentostatin 2 mg/m2 IV was started on day 8 and repeated every 2 weeks. The first cycle of therapy included the week of alemtuzumab dose escalation and 4 subsequent weeks of full dose therapy for a total of 5 weeks. Subsequent cycles were 4 weeks of full dose therapy. Leukocyte growth factor (pegfilgrastim 6 mg SQ x 1 day or GM-CSF 500 mug/d SQ x 5 days) administration was started 48 hours after each dose of pentostatin and all patients had Pneumocystis and herpes virus prophylaxis during therapy and then for 6 months after the last dose of alemtuzumab. Blood cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral assays were done using a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method weekly during treatment with alemtuzumab and all patients with detectable CMV viremia were treated with either valganciclovir or ganciclovir. Patients tolerating therapy and without disease progression received a minimum of 2 cycles of PAR therapy. After completing 2 cycles of therapy, those patients who had achieved a complete clinical response underwent a CT scan of their chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with no pathological radiological findings then underwent a bone marrow study to test for residual CLL. If the bone marrow biopsy showed no morphological evidence of residual CLL, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (see below for details) was performed to evaluate for residual CLL cells. Those patients with an IHC negative (stringent) complete response (CR) had no further therapy. All other patients without progressive disease received a 3rd cycle of therapy. Patients were evaluated by physical examination and blood testing one week after starting therapy, subsequently every 2 weeks during treatment, monthly for 6 months after completing therapy, and then at 9 and 12 months after completing therapy. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 http://ctep.cancer.gov/ with the exception of cytopenias which were graded using the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicity in CLL studies. Response to treatment was measured 2 months after completion of therapy using standard National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 (NCI-WG96) criteria. ',\n"," 'In patients who achieved a complete clinical remission by NCI-WG96 criteria, the bone marrow biopsy was evaluated for residual CLL cells by IHC studies (streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method) with antibodies directed against CD3, CD5, CD23 and PAX5 using standard techniques. The specific focus of the correlative studies was to examine the effects of the first week of therapy with low dose rituximab (20 mg/m2 IV) on circulating CLL cells. Four peripheral blood samples were drawn from each patient: Sample 1 on day 1 of therapy prior to the first dose of rituximab, sample 2 on day 3 before therapy (48 hours after the first dose of rituximab), sample 3 on day 3 one hour after completion of therapy (rituximab infusion followed by SQ alemtuzumab injection), and sample 4 before treatment on day 8 of therapy. Immunophenotypic analyses on CLL cells were performed on the first 13 evaluable patients based on analyses starting with whole blood as previously described. These assays were performed within three days of the blood draw. Alternatively, in the next group of 18 patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated within 2 hours of the blood draw and were then frozen and stored at -150 C as previously described. The PBMC were subsequently thawed in AIM V media (Gibco) and analyzed as above except that the erythrocyte lysis step was omitted. Due to minor adjustments in the blood specimen collection protocols, the absolute lymphocyte counts were measured only in the first and fourth blood sample in the first group of patients, but absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were determined for all four freshly isolated blood samples for the second group of patients. Finally, in certain cases only three (of four) blood samples were obtained for some patients, and therefore the number of data points for specific times in the figures varied slightly. All immunophenotypic assays were run in duplicate. CLL cells were identified as low side scatter, PerCP CD45+ (BD Pharmingen), and PE CD19+ (eBioscience). Levels of CD20 on CLL cells were measured as previously described by probing with ofatumumab or rituximab, followed by secondary development with Al488-labeled mAb HB43, specific for human Fc (American Type Tissue Collection). Deposition of complement C3d fragments was measured with Al488-labeled mAb 1H8. FITC-labeled mAbs specific for complement control proteins CD46 and CD59 were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Monoclonal antibody HD1A, specific for CD55, was the kind gift of Prof. ',\n"," \"Paul Morgan, University of Wales, Cardiff. Certain monoclonal antibodies, including HD1A, were labeled by reaction with Alexa 488 N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the manufacturers' directions (Molecular Probes). In order to test for a correlation between deposited levels of C3d and expression of CD20, a subset of Day 3 Post PBMC samples were first incubated with ofatumumab, washed, and then probed with a cocktail of FITC mAb 1H8, PE CD19, PerCP CD45 and Al647 HB43. Unless otherwise noted, all results for these measurements are normalized to values obtained for the blood samples taken just before the first rituximab infusion. The results for the fresh and frozen samples are plotted in the same figures, but different symbols are used to identify CLL cells that were evaluated in either whole blood (open circles) or as PBMC (closed circles). In a few patients, levels of CD20 in the pre-treatment blood samples were very low (less than 5% of the median levels for the other patients, likely because of recent rituximab treatment), or ALC were less than 5 x 109/L, and these blood samples were not included in the analyses. NK cells were evaluated in blood specimens, taken before and 48 hours after the first dose of rituximab, for changes in numbers as well as expression of CD16 and CD54 as previously described. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from blood by Ficoll separation and red blood cells lysed with ACK buffer. 2 x 106 mononuclear cells were stained with CD54-PE, CD56-A647, CD16-FITC, CD3-APC-Cy7 and CD19-PE-Cy7, fixed and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson LSR II for changes in the percentage counts and expression of CD16 and CD54. This study used a two-stage Simon optimum design with a primary endpoint of CR rate as defined by the NCI-WG96 criteria. The secondary end points were to determine the overall response rate, toxicity of treatment, time to subsequent therapy, and overall and progression free survival. Based on our experience with treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL and patients with progressive disease and 17p13-, we proposed that the largest CR rate where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population was 10%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population would be 30%. A total of 38 evaluable patients provided 93% power, with a 7% Type I error rate. \",\n"," 'The progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. Time to subsequent therapy (TTT) is defined as the time from registration to the time of initiation of subsequent therapy for progressive CLL. Patients who underwent allogeneic transplant or received subsequent treatment before meeting criteria for disease progression were censored for TTT. The distribution of all time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier and differences between subgroups were evaluated using log-rank statistics. The results of rituximab infusions on cell phenotype were evaluated by the Wilcoxin signed-rank test and relationships between continuous variables were examined based on Spearman rank order correlation (Sigma stat). Forty-one patients were enrolled from July 2008 to February 2013 and 39 were evaluable. Two patients did not start treatment. One patient was found to have concomitant Hodgkin lymphoma and the other a serious systemic infection during pre-treatment evaluation. The characteristics of the 39 evaluable patients are summarized in Table I. Complete prior therapy records were available for 34 of the 36 previously treated patients. Of these, 29 (85%) had previously received purine analogue based chemoimmunotherapy. Thirteen (45%) patients were considered to be purine analogue refractory because they had not responded to (n=12), or had a PFS of less than one year following their most recent purine analogue containing chemoimmunotherapy regimen (n=1). Thirty-four (94%) patients had previously received rituximab-based therapy and 8 (22%) had previously received alemtuzumab. TP53 was evaluated by FISH analysis for deletion in all patients and for mutations predicted to be dysfunctional in exons 4-9 by sequencing in 34 patients including all 15 patients with 17p13-. TP53 mutations were detected in 18 (53%) of evaluated patients. Of these patients 13 (72%) also had 17p13- and were thus presumed to have loss of TP53 function (TP53 dysfunction) in the affected CLL cells. Five patients had TP53 mutations without 17p13- and two had 17p13- without detection of a TP53 mutation in the remaining allele. Two patients had both 17p13- and 11q22- in the same CLL clone as previously described, and of these, one also had a TP53 mutation. IGHV analysis showed somatic hypermutation in three (23%) of 13 patients with both 17p13- and TP53 mutation, and two of five patients without 17p13- who had TP53 mutation. ',\n"," 'Both patients with 17p13- and no detected TP53 mutation had unmutated IGHV. Twenty one (54%) patients on this study had very-high risk CLL based on predicted loss of TP53 function (n=13) or purine analogue refractory disease in the absence of evidence of TP53 dysfunction (n=8). Of the 13 patients with purine analogue refractory CLL, 5 (38%) had both a TP53 mutation and 17p13-, one had a TP53 mutation without 17p13-, three had 11q22-, and three were not tested for TP53 mutations. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed all planned therapy including two patients who completed therapy per protocol after two cycles because they had achieved an IHC negative CR. Of the 13 patients who did not complete the planned therapy, four patients received only one cycle, five received two cycles, and four started but did not complete the third cycle of therapy. The reasons for not completing therapy were disease progression (n=4), adverse events (n=5), treating physician and patient choice (n=1), financial hardship (n=1), change to alternative therapy regimen (n=1), and diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma (n=1). There were 28 therapy delays in 23 patients because of adverse events (n=24) and for administrative reasons (n=4). There were no dose reductions for alemtuzumab or rituximab. Pentostatin doses were omitted 17 times in 11 patients and reduced five times in five patients because of adverse events. There were 57 grade 3-4 adverse events at least possibly related to treatment in 27 patients. Of these 22 were neutropenia, 11 were thrombocytopenia, and 8 were infections/febrile neutropenia. Other grade 3-4 hematological events were anemia (n=2), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)(n=2), hemorrhage (n=2), aplastic anemia (n=1), fatigue (n=3), fever (n=3), myalgia (n=1), hypotension (n=1) and hyperuricemia (n=1). There were no deaths attributable to treatment. CMV reactivation occurred in 14 (36%) patients with a median viral load of 2,000 copies/ml (maximum 34,500), and was first detected in cycle 1 of therapy in 10 patients and cycle 2 of therapy in four patients. Eight patients had only one positive test for CMV viremia, five had positive tests for two sequential weeks, and one had positive tests for three sequential weeks. All patients were treated and there were no grade 3-4 events attributable to CMV reactivation, and no interruptions in treatment. AIHA occurred for the first time in two patients during therapy with PAR. ',\n"," \"One patient developed AIHA in cycle 1 of therapy three days after his first dose of pentostatin and the other during cycle 3 of therapy. Both patients responded well to subsequent therapy with high dose methylprednisolone and rituximab. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL, Richter's transformation) was diagnosed in 6 patients at a median time of 6.0 months (range 2.4-17.4) after initiation of PAR. Five of these patients had not responded to the PAR treatment regimen and one had achieved a CRi. Three of these patients had 17p13- and TP53 mutations (TP53 dysfunction) and one had a TP53 mutation without 17p13- (one patient did not have TP53 sequencing data). The DLBCL cells had the same immunoglobulin gene rearrangement as the patients CLL cells (clonal transformation) in all four patients tested. Only two patients had their DLBCL tissue tested for Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) by IHC and both were negative. Four patients developed DLBCL prior to any subsequent treatment for their CLL at a median time of 4.4 months (range 2.4-7.2 months). Two patients developed DLBCL after receiving subsequent treatment for progressive CLL. All six patients died from DLBCL with a median time from diagnosis of DLBCL to death of 9.3 months (5.2-19.3). No additional hematological malignancies were observed. One patient was diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma 3.2 months after initiation of the treatment regimen. Of the five patients aged 70 years or older, two completed three cycles of therapy per protocol. Three patients received two cycles of therapy but did not receive the third cycle because of decisions by the patients and treating physicians based on the severity of cytopenias and social issues. Twenty-two (56%, 95% CI 40-72) patients responded to therapy with 4 (10%) CR, 7 (18%) CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), and 11 (28%) partial responses (PR). Seven (18%) patients had stable disease (SD), and 10 (26%) patients had progressive disease (PD) prior to response evaluation. Four patients (3 CR and 1 CRi) met the criteria for a stringent complete response (IHC negative bone marrow study). The median follow-up for patients still alive was 35 months (range 3-58). Twenty-four patients have had progressive disease. The median progression free survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3,18.3) (Figure 1A). Twenty-one patients have received subsequent treatment for progressive CLL. \",\n"," \"In addition, four patients received additional treatment for their CLL at their physicians' discretion before meeting standard criteria for progression and were censored for time to re-treatment. Seven patients proceeded to planned reduced intensity allogeneic transplant after completing this treatment regimen. These patients had all responded to therapy (5 PR, 1 CRi, 1 stringent CR) and were censored for time to re-treatment. The median time to re-treatment was 9.1 months (95% CI: 5.7,27.0)(Figure 1B). Seventeen patients have died from progressive disease including DLBCL (n=14), infection (n=2, pneumonia, sepsis), and complications of RIC allotransplant (n=1). Median overall survival was 34.1 months (95% CI: 13.6, not reached)(Figure 1C). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients predicted to have loss of TP53 function (17p13- and dysfunctional TP53 mutation) responded to therapy (3 CR/CRi, 4 PR). Of the 3 patients with a CR/CRi, one was censored at 6 months because of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (RIC allotransplant). The other two patients, both of whom had mutated IGHV and one of whom had purine analogue refractory CLL, have not received subsequent treatment after being followed for 27.1 and 41.2 months. Of the 4 patients with a PR, two were previously untreated with 17p13- and were censored at 4.3 and 6.6 months because they underwent RIC allotransplant. The other two patients had subsequent treatment at 8.3 months and 27 months. The latter patient had mutated IGHV. One of the two patients with 17p13- without detectable TP53 mutations had a PR and subsequently was censored at 5.4 months because of additional therapy including a RIC allotransplant. The other patient had PD and died from progressive CLL at 9.8 months. Two of the 5 patients with TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p13- responded to therapy (CRi). Of these patients one with mutated IGHV had not yet been retreated at 46.8 months and the other had unmutated IGHV and required subsequent treatment at 7.5 months. Of the 3 patients who did not respond, one had mutated IGHV. Both patients with a CLL clone with 17p13- and 11q22- had PD before completing their PAR treatment. Outcomes in patients with TP53 dysfunction (17p13- and TP53 mutation, n = 13) were compared to the other patients on this clinical trial. \",\n"," 'There were no significant differences in the overall response rate (54% vs. 58%, p=1), CR/CRi (23% vs. 31%), TTT (median 9.1 vs. 8.3 months, p=0.92) or OS (median 16.8 months vs. not reached, p=0.20) (Supplementary Figure 1A). The comparison of patients with 17p13- to those without 17p13- showed no significant differences in these parameters (data not shown). Seven (54%, 95% CI:25,81) of the 13 patients with purine analogue refractory CLL responded to therapy with 4 CR/CRi and 3 PR. This was not significantly different from the 56% response rate (95%CI: 30,80) among the 16 patients responsive to their most recent purine analogue containing treatment regimen. Of the seven (54%) purine analogue refractory patients who had no detectible TP53 defects, all had unmutated IGHV and 3 had 11q22-. Five of these patients responded to treatment (2 CRi, 3 PR). Three patients were censored because of subsequent treatment at 4.2, 6.8, and 8.5 months. The TTT in the other four patients ranged from 1.3-11.4 months and three patients have died. There was no difference between purine analogue refractory and sensitive patients for TTT (median 9.1 vs. 25.9 months, p=0.97) or OS (18.3 months vs. not reached, p=0.27)(Supplementary Figure 1B). CLL patients with TP53 dysfunction or purine analogue refractory disease in the absence of detectable TP53 dysfunction comprise a cohort with a very high risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. Patients with very high risk CLL (n=21) did not have a significantly different TTT (median 9.1 months vs. 8.3 months, p=0.90) or OS (median 18.3 months vs. not reached, p=0.18) (Supplementary Figure 1C) compared to the 18 patients who did not have very high risk CLL. Three of the 8 patients previously treated with alemtuzumab responded to treatment (all PR). Of the 5 patients 70 years or older (n=5), three responded to treatment (1 CR, 2 PR). The median TTT in this older population was 8.3 months (range 2.7-33.9), three patients died at 7.1, 10.8, and 23.4 months after initiation of PAR and two were alive at 50.8 and 58.0 months. We studied all 26 patients with a baseline ALC >5 x109/L who had not received rituximab therapy for at least one month prior to starting the PAR regimen and had the appropriate specimens collected per protocol. ',\n"," 'The results from evaluation of the effects of IV infusion of low doses (20 mg/m2) of rituximab on normalized levels of ALC (n=14) and of CD20 on circulating CLL cells (n=26) extends and generalizes our previous report in which only six patients received low dose rituximab therapy. The results of infusion of rituximab on day 1 were still evident on day 3, as manifested by decreases in ALC, based on measurements in blood samples (Day 3 Pre) taken just before the second rituximab infusion (p<0.001)(Figure 2A). Moreover, the second rituximab infusion (on day 3) led to rapid and substantial decreases in ALC; on average ALC were reduced to 30% of the respective values before initiation of therapy (p<0.001)(Figure 2A). The first 3 mg dose of alemtuzumab was injected SQ on day 3 after the rituximab infusion, but it is unlikely that this low SQ dose had an immediate effect on ALC. Moreover, although rituximab was also infused on day 5, and alemtuzumab was administered SQ on days 4 and 5 (10 mg and 30 mg, respectively), by day 8 there was a modest, but significant increase in ALC (p<0.05)(Figure 2A), very likely reflecting re-equilibration, between day 5 and day 8, of additional CLL cells into the bloodstream from other compartments. Although cells were indeed cleared from the bloodstream on day 3 (Figure 2A, Day 3 Post), we observed simultaneous loss of CD20 from surviving circulating cells (Figure 2B), and the % of CD20 lost was independent of the starting CD20 levels for a given patient CLL cell population (p=0.733 for fresh samples and p=0.467 for PBMC, Spearman Rank Order correlation). Thus, as we reported previously, based on clinical studies and in vitro models, we find that both trogocytosis (\"shaving\") of CD20 and clearance (both processes likely mediated by fixed tissue macrophages) occurs simultaneously for populations of circulating CLL cells that are opsonized with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab. In order to test for additional validation of this idea, we also examined surviving CLL cells for deposition of C3d fragments. It is well established that cells that are opsonized with rituximab should activate complement, thus allowing in vivo covalent tagging with C3b fragments which will rapidly decay to C3d. ',\n"," 'In the present low-dose rituximab paradigm, if these C3d-tagged cells are not cleared, but CD20 is partially removed, then evidence that the cells must have been previously opsonized with rituximab would be the \"residual\" covalently bound C3d. Indeed, we find that among the surviving CLL cells, significant amounts of C3d fragments are indeed demonstrable (Figure 2C). We examined CLL cells collected on day 3 after therapy (Day 3 Post) for different patients, and we also find that there is a linear correlation between the amount of deposited C3d on the cells and the residual levels of CD20 (correlation coefficient=0.833, p=0.005)(Figures 2D,E). Moreover, dot plots for CLL cells analyzed in these Day 3 Post samples from two representative patients also reveal an approximately linear correlation between the amount of deposited C3d and residual levels of CD20 (Figure 2F). This is reasonable because within a given CLL cell population, the cells with the most CD20 before rituximab infusion will have the most CD20 after, because the % of CD20 loss is not dependent on starting CD20 levels, and higher starting levels of CD20 should of course presage more complement activation and more C3d deposition. Thus, even though CD20 is reduced, the \"signature\" on cells that had been opsonized with rituximab will be residual CD20 along with deposited C3d. Finally, it is important to note that by day 8, expression of CD20 on circulating cells had increased compared to the day 3 post (Figure 2B), indicating that the lower rituximab doses had less profound long-term effects on CD20 levels than has been found for the standard 375 mg/m2 dose of rituximab (>90% loss of CD20 expression). In addition, because the CD20 target is \"restored\" on circulating cells, the next rituximab dose would, as previously reported, be expected to continue to target and clear the CD20 positive cells. We also probed the CLL cells from the Day 3 post treatment samples with the monoclonal anti-human Fc antibody HB43 in order to determine if any rituximab was still bound to the cells soon after completion of the second rituximab infusion. Of 23 patient samples that could be evaluated, 15 had no measureable bound rituximab, but 8 had modest level of rituximab bound, corresponding to 16+-7 % (p<0.001) of the maximum binding that was possible, based on reacting naive CLL cells (sample 1) with excess rituximab (or ofatumumab) followed by monoclonal antibody HB43. ',\n"," 'Several lines of evidence suggest that complement control proteins (CCP) on cancer cells are likely to promote resistance of these cells to monoclonal antibody-based therapies that depend upon complement activation to promote cell elimination. Indeed, under certain conditions CCP might be up-regulated in response to complement-dependent therapies; that is, cells under attack by rituximab and alemtuzumab that express the highest levels of CCP are more likely to survive and this could lead to evolution of more CDC- resistant phenotypes. Therefore, we examined levels of the three key CCP on CLL cells: CD46, CD55 and CD59, before, and after the rituximab and alemtuzumab infusions. Our results (Supplementary Figures 2A-C) indicate that soon after infusion of rituximab there appear to be small but significant decreases in expression of these proteins on surviving CLL cells. These results may be most readily explained based on \"innocent bystander\" decreases in the levels of one or more of these proteins, which can accompany trogocytosis of CD20 mediated by rituximab However, by day 8, after the three infusions of rituximab and alemtuzumab, expression of the three CCP had increased modestly and had returned to close to baseline levels, following the general pattern seen for CD20. We have previously shown in vitro that rituximab-coated target cells can induce changes in NK cell phenotype consistent with NK cell activation including a rapid down-modulation of CD16 and up regulation of a number of markers including CD54. In vivo studies confirmed these changes take place within four hours of therapy with standard dose rituximab, and also are associated with trafficking of NK cells out of the circulation. In this study 8 patients had suitable blood samples taken before and 48 hours after the initiation of RTX therapy with an NK count of at least 0.5% of mononuclear cells in the pre-therapy sample. For logistical reasons, the post rituximab sample was obtained 48 hours after the initiation of the rituximab infusion. As illustrated in Figure 3, low dose rituximab therapy resulted in a significant decrease in NK cell CD16 expression (p=0.001) (Figure 3A), up regulation of surface CD54 (p=0.04) (Figure 3B), and a reduction in NK cell numbers (p<0.0001)(Figure 3C), which indicates NK cell activation by treatment with low dose rituximab. We report the results of treatment of patients with high risk and relapsed/refractory CLL using a novel chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining a purine analogue with alemtuzumab and low dose rituximab. ',\n"," 'This regimen was relatively well tolerated with 67% patients receiving the planned duration of therapy. Only 5 (12.8%) patients did not complete therapy because of treatment related adverse events and there were no treatment related deaths. The overall response rate was 56% of patients with half of the responders achieving a CR/CRi. Despite the short median progression free survival, the median overall survival was 34 months. In addition, patients with very-high risk CLL as defined by TP53 dysfunction or purine analogue refractory disease (n=21) had similar responses to treatment compared to those patients without these adverse characteristics. The correlative laboratory studies showed that the low dose rituximab regimen activated both complement and NK cells and resulted in more limited loss as well as more rapid recovery of CD20 expression by CLL cells compared to that previous demonstrated for treatment with standard dose rituximab. In this small study the CR/CRi rate of 28% was lower than the 30% considered the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the regimen. However, the response to treatment compared favorably with the results of recently reported previous studies in similar patients using other alemtuzumab based combination therapies. The toxicity of the PAR regimen appears to have been less severe than that previously reported for CLL treatment regimens including fludarabine and alemtuzumab used either concomitantly or sequentially. Factors contributing to the lower toxicity of the PAR regimen could have included required prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and CMV monitoring with treatment of CMV reactivation, and the limited duration (maximum of 3 months) of alemtuzumab therapy. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was subsequently diagnosed in 6 (15%) patients treated with PAR and was an important cause of treatment failure and mortality. The study population had a high frequency of advanced stage disease (59%), TP53 dysfunction (33%), 11q22- (15%), unmutated IGHV (69%), and ZAP70 expression (72%), all of which are associated with an increased risk of DLBCL in patients with CLL. Although treatment of CLL with alemtuzumab and purine analogues has also been reported to be associated with development of DLBCL, the role of these drugs in the development of DLBCL remains unclear. In this study, the median interval between starting PAR therapy and the diagnosis of DLBCL was only 4.4 months from start of PAR in patients who did not receive subsequent therapy for their CLL. ',\n"," \"This short interval suggests that DLBCL developed prior to the start of PAR therapy and the treatment of the CLL could have accelerated the diagnosis of the DLBCL rather than being a causative factor in these patients. Of note, a similar high rate of DLBCL was recently reported in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. The high rate of DLBCL in our study population is clearly a serious problem, but we cannot determine whether or not PAR therapy contributed to this complication. There is now substantial evidence that use of conventional doses of rituximab (375 - 500 mg/m2) for the treatment of CLL results in a considerable decrease in CD20 expression by the circulating CLL cells, which results in a loss of efficacy of this drug. In this study, we tested the effect of higher frequency, low dose IV rituximab on expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells and on the activation of NK cells. Our correlative measurements confirm that at rituximab doses as low as 20mg/m2, cells undergo three separate and interrelated fates. These doses provide sufficient rituximab to opsonize and clear the majority of circulating cells, because at the end of the infusion on day 3, ALC levels are reduced considerably (Figure 2A). However, the surviving cells do suffer some loss of CD20 and are also covalently tagged with C3d, indicating that they were also opsonized with rituximab, but were not cleared (Figures 2B,C). Indeed, as demonstrated previously, both clearance and loss of expression of CD20 appear to occur simultaneously, and both processes are mediated in part by the same effector cells, fixed tissue macrophages which express Fcgamma receptors. We also can confirm that loss of CD20 is less pronounced under these low-dose rituximab conditions, and that considerable restoration of CD20 on circulating cells is readily seen based on analyses of blood samples on day 8 (Figure 2B). Moreover, we found that complement was activated based on the appearance of C3d-tagged cells, and the present studies, although limited in time, suggest that CCP are not up-regulated in response to rituximab or alemtuzumab therapy (Supplementary Figure 2). We also found that cells with the most residual CD20 had the greatest amount of deposited C3d. \",\n"," \"This analysis cannot be performed after infusion of large quantities (> 300 mg) of rituximab or ofatumumab, because under these conditions loss of CD20 reaches values in excess of 90%. Our correlative studies also demonstrated that a single, low dose (20 mg/m2 IV) of rituximab therapy can induce activation of NK cells within two days of therapy as indicated by down-modulation of CD16, upregulation of CD54 and a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells (Figure 3). These findings are similar to those found in our prior studies exploring the effect of full dose rituximab on NK cell activation despite a number of differences between the current and prior studies including dose of rituximab (20mg/m2 vs. 375mg/m2), patients (CLL versus lymphoma without significant numbers of circulating B cells) and timing of the post-rituximab sampling (48 hours versus 4 hours). Together, this data suggests the short-term effect of low dose rituximab on NK cell activation is similar to that seen with standard dose therapy. The strengths of our study are detailed characterization of the biology of the patients' malignant B cells, and the comprehensive follow up of all patients after completion of therapy. The study design allowed for collection of serial blood samples that could address important questions about the optimal dosing of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. The limitations of this study include the relatively small number of patients and the limited data on TTT because of early initiation of subsequent treatment, especially in patients proceeding to planned RIC allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This limitation is especially important with regard to determining the benefit of PAR therapy in CLL patients with very high risk disease, where the lack of differences in outcome could reflect the small sample size rather than a true equivalence of treatment efficacy. In conclusion, PAR is effective and tolerable therapy that could be of value in management of patients with very-high risk CLL who fail targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and in patients requiring disease control before therapy with allogeneic transplant or chimeric antigen receptor therapy. This study showed that low dose rituximab activates components of the innate immune system known to be important in its anti-CLL effect without substantially decreasing CD20 expression by circulating CLL cells after treatment. \",\n"," 'Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with TP53 aberrations respond poorly to first-line chemoimmunotherapy resulting in early relapse and short survival. We investigated the safety and activity of ibrutinib in previously untreated and relapsed or refractory CLL with TP53 aberrations. In this investigator-initiated, single-arm phase 2 study we enrolled eligible adult patients with active CLL with TP53 aberrations at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD, USA). Patients received 28-day cycles of ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of limiting toxicities. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment at 24 weeks in all evaluable patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01500733, and is fully enrolled. Between Dec 22, 2011 and Jan 2, 2014 we enrolled 51 patients; 47 had CLL with deletion 17p13.1 and four carried a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. All patients had active disease requiring therapy. 35 enrolled patients had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR 12 9-27 0). 33 previously untreated patients and 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluable for response at 24 weeks. 32 (97%; 95% CI 86-100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response, including partial response in 18 patients (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One patient had progressive disease at 0 4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) achieved a partial response and six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis; the remaining three (20%) patients had stable disease. Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient), anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient). Grade 3 pneumonia occurred in three (6%) patients, and grade 3 rash in one (2%) patient. The activity and safety profile of single-agent ibrutinib in CLL with TP53 aberrations is encouraging and supports its consideration as a novel treatment option for patients with this high-risk disease in both first-line and second-line settings Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, Danish Cancer Society, Novo Nordisk Foundation, National Institutes of Health Medical Research Scholars Program, and Pharmacyclics Inc. ',\n"," 'Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard of care for patients who need treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Patients with TP53 aberrations respond less well to treatment than do those without this high-risk genetic lesion resulting in early relapse and inferior survival. Deletion of chromosome band 17p13.1 results in loss of one allele of the tumour suppressor gene TP53, and the other allele is often incapacitated through point mutations. The P53 pathway induces cell death in response to DNA damage, and its inactivation is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. In previously untreated patients the prevalence of deletion 17p13.1 and TP53 mutations, which often occur together, ranges from 7% to 11 5%. However, selection of chemotherapyresistant clones during treatment increases the prevalence of TP53 aberrations at relapse. The identification of appropriate treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations is a research priority. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has long been viewed as the only option for long-term disease control in these patients. Consensus guidelines recommend allogeneic stem-cell transplantation during first remission for patients with CLL and TP53 aberrations. However, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is not broadly applicable due to the advanced age of most patients with CLL, and transplant-related mortality remains a concern. Alternative treatment options are scarce. The anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab is active in CLL with TP53 aberrations but most responses are not durable and the agent is associated with a high incidence of grade 3 or worse infections. Promising new options include kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib or idelalisib, which have shown activity in relapsed or refractory patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including deletion 17p13.1. With the advent of these novel therapies the role of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations is being re-assessed. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is an orally bioavailable, covalent inhibitor of Bruton\\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK).\"] Once-daily administration causes sustained inactivation of the kinase resulting in inhibition of B-cell receptor signalling and tumour-microenvironment interactions. In a 2013 report of a phase 1b-2 study, 71% of patients in the ibrutinib 420 mg dosing group with relapsed or refractory CLL achieved a response according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria. An additional 20% of patients had partial responses with lymphocytosis. More recently, a randomised comparison of ibrutinib versus the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab showed superior activity of ibrutinib over ofatumumab, including improved survival. ',\n"," 'of ibrutinib over ofatumumab, including improved survival. Based on these studies and the encouraging activity of ibrutinib in patients with deletion 17p13.1, ibrutinib received full Food and Drug Administration approval in the USA on July 28, 2014 for patients with CLL who have received at least one previous therapy, and for those with CLL with deletion 17p13.1. Approval by the European Commission for patients who have received at least one previous therapy, or in first-line CLL patients in the presence of deletion 17p13.1 or TP53 mutation in those unsuitable for chemotherapy was granted on Oct 17, 2014. In view of the encouraging activity of ibrutinib in CLL and the few treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of ibrutinib in this high-risk patient population. For this phase 2, open-label, single-center, investigator-initiated study, between Dec 22, 2011, and Jan 2, 2014, we enrolled previously untreated patients with CLL and patients with relapsed or refractory disease at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, USA. Eligibility criteria included: diagnosis of CLL, including small lymphocytic lymphoma according to WHO criteria, with deletion 17p13.1 identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) in at least 10% of nuclei scored or presence of TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1; active disease requiring therapy according to the IWCLL criteria; age 18 years or older; ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; neutrophil count of at least 500 cells per muL. Exclusion criteria included: being younger than 18 years; transformed disease; autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia necessitating steroid therapy; impaired hepatic function (total bilirubin level >=1 5xthe upper limit of normal [ULN] unless due to Gilbert\\'s disease, or aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >=2 5xULN unless caused by infiltration of the liver), impaired renal function (creatinine concentration >=2 0 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate <=50 mL/min), active Hepatitis B infection, HIV infection, concomitant corticosteroid treatment at doses equivalent to prednisone more than 20 mg per day, and anticoagulation with warfarin.\"] For previously treated patients, a 4-week washout period was required. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute institutional review board. All patients provided written informed consent. ',\n"," 'Pretreatment assessments included a complete medical history; physical examination; ECOG performance evaluation; complete blood count; liver and renal function tests; beta2-microglobulin; serum free light chains; viral serologies for HIV and hepatitis B; lymphocyte phenotyping; bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, peripheral blood flow cytometry, and CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Flow cytometry was used to show that all patients had circulating tumour cells consistent with CLL. Pretreatment lymph node biopsies were obtained in all patients with superficial lymphadenopathy. Interphase FISH was done on peripheral blood or bone marrow in the National Cancer Institute Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory with the Vysis probe (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA); results from accredited external testing facilities were accepted. Sequencing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) was done by LBP in the laboratory of CG (Copenhagen, Denmark). Patients received ibrutinib 420 mg administered orally once daily on a continuous schedule until disease progression or toxicity necessitated drug discontinuation. Each cycle was 28 days (give or take 4 days). Ibrutinib treatment was paused in cases of grade 4 neutropenia lasting for longer than 7 days or any grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Patients who had a first occurrence of grade 3 diarrhoea, constitutional symptoms, or infection were restarted at the same dose when the toxicity resolved to grade 1 severity or less or to baseline. For any other grade 3 adverse event, the dose was reduced by 140 mg. For new-onset or symptomatic atrial fibrillation (grade 2), ibrutinib treatment was paused and a cardiac assessment was done. After resolution of a first occurrence of atrial fibrillation of up to grade 2 severity, the study drug could be restarted at the same dose. Safety monitoring was done every other week for the first month, then monthly until month 6, and every 3 months thereafter. Laboratory tests as part of safety monitoring included complete blood counts, and acute care, hepatic, and mineral panels. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment after six cycles of therapy at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were safety, overall survival, progression-free survival, best response, and nodal response. Data cutoff for study analysis was Aug 1, 2014. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Haematological adverse events were graded according to IWCLL criteria. ',\n"," 'Responses were assessed based on IWCLL 2008 criteria, incorporating the recent updates on partial response with lymphocytosis (appendix p 2). Clinical response was assessed at each visit. At 2, 6, and 12 months, radiological assessments were done. Responses reported here are based on these radiological assessments. Bone marrow evaluation was undertaken in 42 patients at 8 weeks, and in 47 patients at 24 weeks. The bone marrow at 8 weeks was omitted in the first patients and one patient refused bone marrow biopsy at 24 weeks. Bone marrow samples were assessed by immunostaining. FISH for deletion 17p13.1 was repeated on blood samples at 24 weeks. The frequency of deletion 17p13.1 in all CLL cells was calculated as 1 divided by the proportion of CD19+ cells in all lymphocytes multiplied by the proportion of cells with deletion 17p13.1. Spleen volume was calculated from CT scans with the Vitrea Core Workstation Server, version 6.6 (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN, USA). We used a Simon\\'s minimax two-stage design to test the null hypothesis that the proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the study was 15% or lower versus the alternative hypothesis that it was 40% or higher, with a type I error of 0 05 and 90% power.\"] We established that a sample size of 27 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint was needed. Initially, both untreated and relapsed or refractory patients were enrolled. On Aug 24, 2012, the study was amended by the investigators to allow enrolment of an entire cohort of 27 previously untreated patients, in addition to a cohort of 16 patients with relapsed or refractory disease. We enrolled eight additional previously untreated patients to account for the possibility of non-treatment-related discontinuation before 6 months. The safety and survival analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. Objective responses were assessed in patients who were evaluable at 24 weeks. We used descriptive statistics to summarise the findings in each of the defined cohorts, including the primary endpoint. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival (defined as time from study enrolment to death) and progression-free survival (defined as time from study enrolment to progression or death). We estimated the cumulative incidence of progression by considering deaths without relapse as competing risk events. We compared survival probabilities by the log-rank test and cumulative incidence by the Gray\\'s test.\"] R version 3.1.1 was used for statistical analyses. ',\n"," \"This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01500733. his study was funded by the Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.

The investigators analysed the data and wrote the report. A draft was submitted to Pharmacyclics for comments. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the content of the report and the decision to submit for publication. Between Dec 22, 2011 and Jan 2, 2014, we screened 85 patient records and enrolled 51 eligible patients with CLL, of whom 35 had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease (figure 1, table 1). Most patients had advanced Rai stage and IGHV-unmutated disease (table 1). 47 patients had deletion 17p13.1 identified by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation in at least 10% of nuclei scored and four patients (two in each cohort) had a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. 35 patients were previously untreated, 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. At the time of analysis, median follow-up for all patients was 24 months (IQR 12 9-27 0). Median follow-up for the previously untreated cohort was 15 months (IQR 12 5-25 7) and for the relapsed or refractory cohort was 26 months (25 4--28 3). 42 (82%) of 51 enrolled patients are still on treatment without disease progression. Nine (18%) of 51 patients discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression in five (10%) patients, and three (6%) deaths. One patient, who was found to have Hodgkin's lymphoma that predated enrolment into the study, was taken off study and is included in the safety analysis only (figure 1, appendix p 1). Progressive disease was caused by Richter's transformation in three patients. An additional two patients had prolymphocytic transformation. Median time to progression for these five patients was 7 5 months (IQR 7 2 - 15 0). \",\n"," 'At 24 weeks 48 patients were evaluable for response (33 previously untreated patients and 15 relapsed/refractory patients). 44 (92%; 95% CI 84 - 100) of these 48 patients achieved an objective response; 24 (50%) had a partial response, and 20 (42%) patients achieved an objective response(95% CI 84-99.5), 24 (50%)a partial response with lymphocytosis (table 2). 32 (97%; 95% CI 86 - 100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response including partial response in 18 (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One previously untreated patient had progressive disease at 0 4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) patients achieved a partial response, six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis, and three patients had stable disease. The proportion of patients achieving an overall response in subgroups based on IGHV mutation status, age, Rai disease stage, beta2-microglobulin, or the presence of bulky lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly was similar (appendix p 3). However, the distribution of partial response and partial response with lymphocyotsis showed some variation (appendix p 3), consistent with different rates of resolution of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis between patients. The rate and depth of response increased with time. Partial response was recorded in six (13%) of 48 patients at 8 weeks and in 24 (50%) at 24 weeks. Conversely, a partial response with lymphocytosis was recorded in 24 (50%) patients at 8 weeks and 20 (42%) patients at 24 weeks. The best response achieved was objective response in 45 (94%; 95% CI 87-100) of all 48 evaluable patients, in 32 (97%; 86-100) of the 33 evaluable patients with previously untreated disease, and in 13 (87%; 69 5-100) of the 15 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Five (10%) of all evaluable patients had a complete response as best response, of whom four had IGHV-unmutated CLL, and all except for one were previously untreated. Median time to complete response was 48 weeks (IQR 48-48). Rapid disease control was achieved in all tissue compartments, reaching at least a 50% mean reduction in tumour burden in both spleen and lymph nodes at 8 weeks, with further improvements on continued therapy (figure 2A, 2B).Responses in the bone marrow seemed to be somewhat slower than in the spleen and lymph nodes. ',\n"," 'At 8 weeks, at least a 50% decrease in tumour burden in the bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen was recorded in 16 (44%) of 36, 31 (70%) of 44, and 30 (79%) of 38 patients with complete data, respectively. At the completion of 24 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in tumour burden in bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen was 34 (83%) of 41, 42 (93%) of 45, and 38 (95%) of 40 patients with complete data, respectively. Reasons for incomplete data include omission of bone marrow biopsies or insufficient material (n=2 at 8 weeks, n=7 at 24 weeks), missing scans (n=2 at 8 weeks, n=1 at 24 weeks), and absence of pathological lymphadenopathy (n=2) or splenomegaly (n=7) at baseline. In three patients, no residual CLL infiltrate was detected in the bone marrow by immunohistochemistry. The quality of tumour response in the tissue sites did not differ by previous treatment history or IGHV mutation status (figure 2C, 2D). The characteristic treatment-induced lymphocytosis was reported in most patients, and the degree and kinetics did not differ in previously untreated patients compared with those with relapsed or refractory disease (figure 2C). By contrast, patients with IGHV-mutated CLL had a greater relative increase and slower resolution of lymphocytosis than did those with IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 2D). Estimated progression-free survival for all patients on an intention-to-treat basis at 24 months was 82% (95% CI 71-94), and overall survival at 24 months was 80% (68-94) (figure 3A, 3B). At final follow-up for this report (Aug 1, 2014), eight (16%) patients had died: five (10%) from progressive disease, two (4%) from infection, and one (2%) patient with sudden unexplained death that was judged to be possibly treatment related (appendix p 1). The estimated overall survival at 24 months was 84% (95% CI 72-100) for previously untreated patients and 74% (57-100) for patients with relapsed or refractory disease (figure 3C); it was 94% (95% CI 84-100) in IGHV-mutated and 71% (53-94) in IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 3D). The cumulative incidence of progression at 24 months was 20% (95% CI 5-44) in patients with relapsed or refractory disease, 9% (1-27) in previously untreated patients (figure 3E), and 20% (7-39) for IGHV-unmutated CLL (figure 3F). None of the patients with IGHV-mutated CLL have progressed so far. ',\n"," 'To assess whether or not deletion 17p13.1 confers resistance to ibrutinib, we established the proportion of CLL cells carrying deletion 17p13.1 at baseline and after 24 weeks on treatment. In 43 evaluable patients, the proportion of CLL cells with deletion 17p13.1 decreased in 20 (47%) patients (median decrease 48% [IQR 18 7-82 8%]), increased in 20 (47%) patients (median increase 12% [4 2-43 9%]), and remained unchanged in three (6%) patients (appendix p 4). In the 20 patients with a relative increase in the frequency of deletion 17p13.1, none progressed, 18 (90%) had a clinical response at 24 weeks, and two (10%) patients had stable disease. All of these patients are still continuing in the study on treatment without progression at data cutoff (Aug 1, 2014). Of the four patients who developed progressive disease beyond 24 weeks, two were included in this analysis, in both of whom the proportion of CLL cells with deletion 17p13.1 was decreased compared with baseline at 24 weeks. Treatment with ibrutinib was well tolerated. Most nonhaematological adverse events were of grade 1 or 2 severity (table 3). The most frequent possibly treatmentrelated adverse events were arthralgia, diarrhoea, rash, nail ridging, bruising, and muscle spasms or cramps. The most common non-haematological grade 3 adverse event was pneumonia in three (6%) patients. No grade 3 or worse bleeding events occurred. One patient (2%) required a dose reduction for grade 3 rash. No other adverse events required dose reductions or withdrawal of patients from the study. Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients, anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (table 3). Cytopenias mainly occurred during the first few months on therapy, improved with continuous treatment, and were not associated with infections or bleeding. TP53 aberrations identify a high-risk group of patients with CLL for whom no standard treatment exists. Responses to front-line chemoimmunotherapy are short lived. Ibrutinib has shown activity in relapsed and refractory patients including in those with deletion 17p13.1. We report mature results from a phase 2 trial of single-agent ibrutinib for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations including:to the best of our knowledge:the largest experience in previously untreated patients receiving this targeted agent as first-line therapy (panel). Ibrutinib induced responses in 32 (97%) of the 33 evaluable, previously untreated patients; the estimated rate of progression was 9% (95% CI 1a$\"27) at 24 months. ',\n"," \"This finding contrasts with responses in around 68% of patients and median progression-free survival of less than 12 months when first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab are used to treat these high-risk patients. Our study includes 35 patients with TP53 aberrations receiving ibrutinib as first-line therapy:a number that is similar to the combined 30 previously untreated patients with deletion 17p13.1 who were treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in the two largest studies done so far. Another non-chemotherapy based regimen active in CLL with TP53 aberrations is alemtuzumab with methylprednisolone, which in first line achieved a response in 88% of patients and a median progression-free survival of 18 3 months (95% CI 15 6-not available). Longer follow-up with ibrutinib is needed to better assess durability of response and the possible need for subsequent treatment. Safety and tolerability of treatment with ibrutinib was favourable and similar to findings reported in other studies. Only one patient needed a dose reduction and no patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. In the phase 1b-2 study of single-agent ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory CLL, the estimated progression-free survival at 26 months for patients with deletion 17p13.1 was 57%, but more than 90% for patients without deletion 17p13.1 or 11q22.3. We therefore sought to investigate whether deletion 17p13.1 confers resistance to ibrutinib that would lead to relapse as reported with chemoimmunotherapy. However, sequential FISH analysis provided no evidence for the selection of resistant subclones with deletion 17p13.1 during ibrutinib therapy, which supports a probably P53-independent mechanism of action. The type of response that occurred with ibrutinib differs from that achieved with chemoimmunotherapy. Deep remissions, at least during the first year on therapy, were rare, even in previously untreated patients. However, as we and others have previously reported, residual disease that persists during ibrutinib therapy consists mostly of quiescent cells with a low proliferative rate. Consistently, the presence of residual disease does not seem to predict treatment failure, by contrast with the experience with chemoimmunotherapy. Disease progression on treatment was reported in only five (10%) patients and occurred at a median of 7 5 months (IQR 7 2-15 0). Notably, all five patients had transformation, which manifested as Richter's syndrome in three patients and as prolymphocytic transformation in two. In retrospect, transformation might have already been present at study entry in two patients (appendix p 1). \",\n"," 'In addition to TP53 aberrations, all the patients who progressed had additional high-risk disease features at baseline: all had IGHV-unmutated CLL, two had MYC amplification (a rare ultra-high-risk event in CLL), and three had been heavily pretreated. Recently, Richter\\'s transformation was reported in 23% of patients with deletion 17p13.1 after a median of 12 months from first-line therapy, mainly with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Thus, the rate of transformation on ibrutinib seems to be lower than reported with other frequently used first-line therapies for high-risk patients. However, additional follow-up will be needed to better assess the long-term transformation rate in patients treated with ibrutinib. Tumour microenvironment interactions and B-cell receptor signalling are pivotal pathogenic pathways in CLL and are targets for new therapeutic approaches. The substantial reduction in disease burden and the notable reduction in intracellular signalling, cellular activation, and proliferation throughout the different anatomical compartments is consistent with the role of BTK as a central node in many signalling pathways. Recently, acquired mutations in BTK and PLCg2 that confer resistance to ibrutinib have been reported. However, the low frequency of these mutations suggests that tumour cells cannot easily bypass the block in intracellular signalling imposed by ibrutinib. In conclusion, single-agent ibrutinib induced durable responses in CLL with TP53 aberrations. Treatment failure in previously untreated patients was rare. Subclones with deletion 17p13.1 were equally sensitive to ibrutinib as were those not carrying the deletion, which is consistent with a P53-independent mechanism of action of the drug. The quality and duration of response might be improved further with combination therapy. These data support the use of ibrutinib as first-line therapy of CLL with TP53 aberrations. Longer follow-up will be needed to assess the effect of this targeted agent on long-term survival, which will clarify whether or not ibrutinib could eventually replace allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for these high-risk patients. We designed this study in 2011 to investigate novel treatment options for patients with TP53 aberrations. Although chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab was firmly established as an effective regimen for most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), patients with TP53 aberrations had poor outcomes. We searched PubMed for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2006, and June, 2011 for treatment options in CLL with TP53 aberrations or deletion 17p13.1, using the search terms \"chronic lymphocytic leukemia\", \"TP53\", \"deletion 17p\", \"alemtuzumab\", \"flavopiridol\", and \"lenalidomide\". ',\n"," 'In particular, alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, and flavopiridol, were shown to have activity in at least a subset of these high-risk patients (summarised by Badoux and colleagues). However, responses to these agents were often short lived. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was known to provide long-term disease control and consensus guidelines recommend this transplantation approach in first remission for patients with CLL and deletion 17p13.1. Early data about ibrutinib presented at scientific meetings suggested it had good activity in CLL, irrespective of whether or not classical high-risk disease features were present. Several studies have now established ibrutinib as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for relapsed or refractory patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations. Ibrutinib is now approved in both the USA and Europe for patients with relapsed disease and as first-line therapy for CLL with deletion 17p13.1 (USA and EU) or TP53 aberrations (EU). Our study provides mature data for the largest cohort so far of such high-risk patients receiving ibrutinib as first-line therapy. Although progressive disease manifested as transformation in 10% of patients on this study, the rate of transformation on ibrutinib seems to be lower than previously reported with first-line chemoimmunotherapy. With the advent of active targeted agents such as ibrutinib, chemoimmunotherapy for patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations should be avoided. ',\n"," 'CD52 and CD20 antigens are important therapeutic targets for the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) alemtuzumab and rituximab respectively. Circulating CD52 (cCD52) and CD20 (cCD20) have prognostic utility in lymphoid malignancies. The efficacy of mAb therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) may be adversely affected by cCD52 or cCD20. In this report, blood and bone marrow (BM) cCD52 and cCD20 were measured at response assessment in previously treated (N = 235) patients with CLL who received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). Univariate and multivariate statistical models evaluated correlations of pre- and response variables with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Response variables included 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) response, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) in BM, and cCD52 and cCD20 levels (blood and BM) at response assessment. Using multivariate analysis, response blood and BM cCD52, blood cCD20, and NCI-WG response were significant independent predictors of PFS. At the time of response assessment, BM cCD52 correlated with OS in univariate analysis. cCD52 and cCD20, therefore appear useful in predicting survival and may be important for monitoring patients following salvage FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) therapy. These data further indicate that plasma may be a good target to evaluate for minimal residual disease using cCD52/cCD20 levels. The clinical course for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is varied, with some patients having smouldering, asymptomatic disease and others having rapid progression. Identifying prognostic markers and factors that may be useful in guiding management and follow-up are important for patients with CLL. Prognostic factors that are being studied as potentially important predictors of clinical endpoints, such as time to treatment, response to treatment, remission duration, and overall survival (OS), include IGHV mutation status; expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 by leukaemia cells; plasma levels of beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) and circulating CD23; and presence of chromosome abnormalities, such as 17p deletion and 11q deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. These factors were initially studied in selected patient populations in retrospective analyses. True appreciation of the utility and importance of each factor will come with prospective analyses in unselected patients. Some of these factors are static and do not change through the clinical course, and others may change, such as acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (clonal evolution). Less is known about the importance of these prognostic factors in previously treated patients. ',\n"," 'Chemoimmunotherapy, specifically the combination of anti-CD20 (rituximab) and/or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapeutic agents, has shown impressive efficacy in the treatment of CLL in frontline and salvage settings. CD20 is an integral membrane protein expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes and may play a role in proliferation, differentiation, and regulation of B lymphocyte activities. Although it has four transmembrane-spanning regions, and therefore is highly membrane embedded, high levels of circulating CD20 (cCD20) have been detected in plasma samples from patients with CLL, and have been correlated with advanced stage CLL and shorter survival. This cCD20 probably represents membrane fragments in plasma from apoptotic cells that result from cell turnover, rather than specifically shed protein. In vitro studies have shown that cCD20 can interfere with rituximab binding to CLL cells; therefore, high cCD20 levels may act as an in vivo sump, altering rituximab pharmacokinetics and minimizing the clinical response to rituximab. The amount of circulating CD52 (cCD52) has prognostic value in patients with CLL. CD52 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell protein expressed on the surface of haematopoietic cells, including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. CD52 is also expressed on neoplastic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin. cCD52 was detected at higher levels in patients with CLL, compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, low levels of cCD52 were correlated with less aggressive disease, higher complete response (CR) rates following treatment and longer survival in patients with CLL. In contrast to CD20, and in view of its GPI linkage, CD52 is thought to be actively shed from the surface of lymphocytes. cCD52 may also be detected as membrane fragments produced by apoptosis and cell turnover. cCD52 may interfere with alemtuzumab binding to CLL cells, and lower levels of cCD52 have been correlated with increased response to alemtuzumab. There is a clear correlation between the response to treatment by 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria and the progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for patients with CLL. One of the potential shortcomings of the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria is that residual disease is identified by microscopic examination of blood and bone marrow, which does not address residual disease in others sites, such as lymph node and spleen. New assays to evaluate response and predict for PFS and OS potentially could therefore be used in conjunction with 1996 NCI-WG response criteria to better predict these important clinical outcomes. ',\n"," \"with 1996 NCI-WG response criteria to better predict these important clinical outcomes. We evaluated the prognostic value of cCD20 and cCD52 in peripheral blood and BM at the time of response assessment from 235 previously treated patients who received the three-drug combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Additionally, we evaluated the pre-treatment characteristics, which may be helpful in predicting PFS and OS following FCR therapy in patients with CLL. Patients in this analysis included 177 patients from a previously published study investigating the efficacy of FCR in the salvage setting for whom we had cryopreserved samples, and 58 additional patients. All patients provided informed consent according to U.T. MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional guidelines. Briefly, 235 previously treated patients with CLL were enrolled on a phase II clinical trial starting in November, 1999. Pre-treatment evaluation included history, physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, platelet (PLT) count, liver and kidney function tests, beta2M, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and BM aspiration with immunophenotyping and BM biopsy. Refractoriness to fludarabine or alkylating agents was defined as failure to achieve at least partial remission (PR) with the last agent-based treatment or progression within 6 months of treatment. Patients were to receive up to six courses of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, each daily for 3 d, and a single dose of rituximab 375 mg/m2, course 1 and 500 mg/m2 courses 2-6. Each course was 4 weeks as permitted by recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts. Response to treatment and progression were evaluated by the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria. CR required resolution of all palpable disease, normalization of blood counts and no evidence of disease in BM biopsy. Nodular partial remission (nPR) required the same criteria as for CR except that one or more lymphoid nodules or aggregates were present on bone marrow biopsy. PR criteria included at least 50% reduction in measurable disease and one or more of the following features: neutrophil count > 1 5 x 109/l or a 50% improvement over baseline, platelets >= 100 x 109/l or a 50% improvement over baseline, and haemoglobin >= 110 g/l or a 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions. Imaging studies (i.e. computed tomography scans) were not required to evaluate response. The response must have persisted for more than 2 months. Patients' BM was also evaluated by 2-colour flow cytometry for presence of CD5/19+ cells as a measure of residual disease. \",\n"," 'Blood and/or bone marrow (BM) samples for cCD20 and cCD52 evaluation were obtained pre-treatment in a limited number of patients, and at specific time points following treatment in greater proportion. Samples at the following time points from start of treatment were available for BM cCD20 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 50), 3 months (n = 29), 6 months (time of response assessment) (n = 66), 12 months (n = 71), 18 months (n = 49), 24 months (n = 48), and 36 months (n = 38); BM cCD52 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 50), 3 months (n = 29), 6 months (n = 67), 12 months (n = 71), 18 months (n = 49), 24 months (n = 48), and 36 months (n = 38); blood cCD20 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 27), 3 months (n = 22), 6 months (n = 61), 12 months (n = 68), 18 months (n = 46), 24 months (n = 54), and 36 months (n = 41); and blood cCD52 measurement: pre-treatment (n = 27), 3 months (n = 21), 6 months (n = 62), 12 months (n = 68), 18 months (n = 47), 24 months (n = 53), and 36 months (n = 42). To reduce the possibility that the clotting process may damage circulating cells and influence the levels of cCD20, plasma, rather than serum, was used for measuring cCD20 and cCD52 in blood. Anti-coagulated BM samples were centrifuged to obtain the non-cellular fluid phase used to measure BM cCD52 and cCD20. Despite the precautions taken during BM sample collection, dilution of BM samples by blood cannot be fully excluded. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to detect plasma cCD20 and cCD52 levels as previously described. Briefly, the sample was added to a 96-well polystyrene plate coated with anti-CD20 or anti-CD52, and incubated for 3 h with constant shaking at room temperature. Subsequently, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated for 3 h with 20 mul of humanized anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:400 in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0 1% Tween 20. Following six more washes with PBS-T, 100 mul of colorimetric substrate was added to the wells and plates were then incubated with constant shaking for 15-30 min. ',\n"," \"Following the addition of 50 mul of 2 N HCl to quench the reaction, the plates were read at a wavelength of 450 nm. Assessment of IGHV for MRD was performed as previously described. PCR was performed on DNA samples from blood and BM cells using 5' fluorescently end-labelled consensus primers for the rearranged IGH CDRIII region, FR3A [5'-ACACGGC(C/T)(G/C) TGTATTACTGT-3'] and VLJH (5'-GTGACCAGGGTNCCTTGGCCCCAG-3'). PCR products were resolved on 3100 genetic analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and peak areas and heights were determined by Genescan analysis software (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescently-tagged PCR amplification products were subsequently digested with the restriction enzyme HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA, USA). Resulting fragments were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel, and then isolated using gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). Ligase chain reaction (LCR) using Taq DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) was subsequently performed on patient's PCR amplified DNA, and products were resolved on the ABI 3100 under similar conditions described for the PCR assay. The ratio of the peak areas of VLJH to K-RAS (internal control) was reported as positive (ratio > 0 2), low positive (ratio < 0 2), or negative (ratio = 0). This ligase-based assay was reported to have similar sensitivity to allele-specific PCR. Patient characteristics were summarized using median (range) for numerical variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. OS time was defined as the time interval from enrollment on protocol (or start of therapy) to death or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time interval from enrollment on protocol to progression (1996 NCI-WG criteria), death or last follow-up. Both cCD20 and cCD52 were treated as continuous variables in Cox regression analyses. OS or PFS probabilities were estimated by Kaplan and Meier analyses. The differences in OS or PFS among subgroups of patients were evaluated using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the ability of patient characteristics to predict OS or PFS, with goodness-of-fit assessed by the Grambsch-Therneau test, Schoenfeld residual plots, and martingale residual plots. Predictive variables were transformed as appropriate based on these plots. CART (Categorization and Regression Tree) analysis was used to search for the optimal cutoff values for covariates. Tables I and II contain the full list of variables that were assessed in the univariate Cox models. Only variables with P-value <= 0 05 in the univariate fit were considered for the multivariate models. \",\n"," 'A multivariate Cox model was developed for OS and PFS by performing a backward elimination with P-value cutoff of 0 05, then allowing any variable previously deleted to enter the final model if its P-value was <0 05. Of note, we did not include pre- and post-treatment variables in the same multivariate analyses. Natural logarithmic (Ln)-transformation was used for some variables to minimize skewing of data points. All computations were carried out in S-Plus. Pre-treatment patient characteristics are presented in Table I. Routine blood studies, included blood counts and chemistries, physical examination findings and BM biopsy were evaluated at study entry. Seventy percent of patients were male, Rai stages were well represented, and most patients had a performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. Seventy percent of patients had received <= 2 prior treatments, and 25% and 17% were considered refractory to alkylating agents and fludarabine respectively. Significant differences were noted between BM (median = 100 nmol/l) and peripheral blood cCD20 (median = 257 nmol/l) (P = 0 02, Wilcoxn rank-sum test) as well as peripheral blood cCD20 and cCD52 (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0 54; P-value < 0 001). The majority (63%) of patients completed >= 4 courses of FCR. Responses to treatment are shown in Table II. CR and PR rates were both 30%; nodular PR was seen in 15% of patients. Measures of residual disease, in addition to 1996 NCI-WG response criteria, were used to evaluate patients. Two-colour flow cytometry evaluation of the BM for CD5/CD19 at response assessment or 2 months following the last cycle of FCR for those that did not receive 6 cycles, and PCR for IGHV yielded similar frequencies of patients with MRD (25% vs. 23% respectively). Distribution of cCD20 and cCD52 levels is shown in Table III. The majority of patients had cCD20 and cCD52 values available at the time of response assessment; however, too few patients had pre-treatment values to perform meaningful analyses. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment. The 1st and 3rd quartile values are shown to demonstrate the distribution of cCD20 and cCD52 measurements used in these analyses (Table III). ',\n"," 'For a given patient, there was a significant difference between the BM and blood cCD20 at the time of response assessment (P = 0 02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), but no significant differences were noted for BM and blood cCD52 at the time of response assessment (P = 0 72, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additionally, to determine the correlation between number of FCR cycles and blood cCD20 and cCD52 levels, patients were grouped into 3 categories based on the number of FCR cycles received: (i) <=3 cycles; (ii) 4 or 5 cycles; and (iii) >=6 cycles. There was a significant association between blood cCD20 at the time of response assessment and the number of FCR cycles (P-value = 0 04; Kruskal-Wallis test), but no significant association between blood CD52 at 6 months and the number of FCR cycles (P-value = 0 95; Kruskal-Wallis test). At the time of these analyses, the median follow up time was 75 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 72-81]. One hundred and seventeen patients (66%) of 177 responders (CR, nPR, or PR) have relapsed and the median time to progression was 29 months (95% CI = 27-38 months). Of the 233 patients analysed, 146 patients (63%) have died and the median survival time was 47 months (95% CI = 41-58 months). We determined cutoff values for BM CD52 and CD20, as well as blood CD52 and CD20, and correlated these values with PFS (Fig 1). Cutoff values for BM CD52, BM CD20, blood CD52 and blood CD20 at response assessment were 10, 5, 28 and 179 nmol/l respectively. The cutoff values for cCD20 or cCD52 were chosen using CART (classification and regression tree) analysis, which gives a more robust analysis compared to using median values or quartiles, the latter limited by the small number of patients for whom we had measured values at the indicated quartiles. PFS was significantly longer in patients with lower CD20 and CD52 levels in BM and blood at end of treatment (Fig 1). Although BM CD20 was significant in univariate analysis, it did not achieve statistical significance in the multivariate model. The use of rituximab in the treatment of all patients in this study may have affected the measurement of CD20 and therefore the outcomes of the analysis. ',\n"," 'Survival was correlated with 1996 NCI-WG response status; those who achieved a CR had the longest PFS, while patients with PR had the shorter PFS (data not shown). Similarly, a significantly longer OS was noted in patients who achieved CR/nPR, compared with those who achieved PR. Patients who did not respond to treatment [non-responder/early death (NR/ED)] had the shortest OS (data not shown). Univariate analyses showed the following pretreatment characteristics to be correlated with shorter PFS: advanced age (relative risk (RR) = 1 020; P = 0 02), elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 1 808; P = 0 008) and elevated LDH (RR = 1 733; P = 0 05); smaller spleen size was correlated with longer PFS (RR = 0 948; P = 0 04). Table IVA shows factors evaluated at end of treatment that correlated with longer PFS, namely lower cCD20 and cCD52 in blood and bone marrow and lower level of residual disease by two-colour flow cytometry for CD5/CD19+ cells and PCR for IGHV in bone marrow. Univariate analyses for pretreatment characteristics that correlated with shorter OS were advanced age (RR = 1 035; P <= 0 001); advanced Rai stage (high-risk) (RR = 1 8; P < 0 001); low haemoglobin (RR = 0 86; P <= 0 001); low albumin (RR = 0 62; P = 0 006); elevated alk phos (RR = 1 006; P = 0 03); elevated creatinine (ln Cr) (RR = 2 201; P = 0 03); elevated LDH (RR = 1 87; P = 0 002); elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 2 67; P <= 0 001); more than one prior treatment (RR = 1 47; P = 0 03); and refractoriness to alkylating agents (RR = 1 67; P = 0 007). Table IVB shows factors evaluated at end of treatment that correlated with longer PFS, namely lower cCD52 in bone marrow and lower level of residual disease by two-colour flow cytometry for CD5/CD19+ cells and PCR for IGHV in bone marrow. Multivariate analysis of pre- and post-treatment variables evaluated separately demonstrated that elevated beta2M and splenomegaly were independently associated with shorter PFS (Table V). Shorter PFS was independently associated with an inferior response to treatment (NCI-WG criteria), higher blood cCD20 and cCD52 at end of treatment and higher BM cCD52 at end of treatment (Table V). ',\n"," 'Elevated beta2M (ln beta2M) (RR = 2 46; P < 0 001), lower albumin level (RR = 0 66; P = 0 05) and refractoriness to alkylating agents (RR = 1 68; P = 0 009) were significant independent pre-treatment predictors for shorter OS in multivariate analysis. The strongest post-treatment predictor for a shorter OS was achievement of PR/NR/ED (versus CR/nPR-1996 NCI-WG response status) (RR = 4 70; P < 0 0001). Neither cCD52 nor cCD20 added to this multivariate model. The lack of association of cCD52 and cCD20 with OS may be attributed to that fact that many patients received subsequent salvage therapy, which can impact survival. cCD20 and cCD52 appear to be important biological markers in CLL. We have previously analysed patient characteristics in this cohort of patients that predict for survival; however, the data presented in this study demonstrate for the first time that cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment are predictors for post-treatment survival (PFS or OS) in CLL patients treated with FCR. Most notably, BM and blood cCD52 as well as blood cCD20 at response assessment were independent predictors for PFS in patients treated with FCR. Although our data seem to validate previously reported pre-treatment clinical and laboratory parameters as being significant prognostic factors for patients with CLL, this is the first report to describe that cCD20 and cCD52 at response assessment are important predictors of disease outcomes in CLL. Prior reports demonstrated the prognostic significance of both cCD20 and cCD52 in patients with lymphoid malignancies. showed that cCD52 was detectable at baseline in plasma from patients with CLL and that higher levels significantly correlated with advanced Rai stage, higher beta2M, immunoglobulin mutation status, and worse survival. Similarly, higher baseline cCD20 levels in plasma were shown to correlate positively with beta2M, leukaemia cell expression of CD38, advanced stage disease (Rai and Binet), and significantly shorter survival. In patients with non-Hodgkin (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma, pre- and post-treatment levels of serum cCD52 had no predictive value for survival, while post- treatment serum cCD20 levels were highly correlated with survival in NHL patients. Our results further extend these findings, specifically highlighting the prognostic value of cCD20 and cCD52 at the time of response assessment following therapy with FCR in previously treated patients. ',\n"," \"Unlike the aforementioned report examining post-treatment cCD20 and cCD52 levels, where patients were treated with various regimens not including rituximab or alemtuzumab, all patients included in our study were treated uniformly with FCR. Furthermore, we did not use previously reported cutoff values for cCD20 and cCD52 in our analyses but examined values at the time of response assessment and general trends over time. In fact, the median values measured in our studies for cCD52 and cCD20 were much lower than those previously reported (1875 nmol/l and 2336 nmol/l for cCD20 and cCD52 respectively); this is probably secondary to our reported values representing post-treatment cCD20 and cCD52. Previously well-documented prognostic factors including age, haemoglobin, beta2M, and NCI-WG response status were confirmed in our analyses. Although BM samples may be more difficult to obtain in clinical practice, BM values are part of the 1996 NCI-WG response criteria, and therefore BM cCD20 and cCD52 were included in our study. cCD20 and cCD52 levels were correlated with PFS in multivariate analysis (Table V). Continued follow up may demonstrate that cCD20 and cCD52 are important prognostic factors for OS, even though they were not significantly correlated with OS in this analysis. In addition to cCD20 and cCD52, our results also showed PCR for IGHV to be a significant prognostic factor in previously treated patients, with higher levels correlated with shorter survival. Detection of IGHV is a sensitive marker of residual disease, and may signify failure of FCR to fully eradicate the malignant clones. Nevertheless, when used simultaneously with cCD52 and cCD20 in the multivariate analysis models (Table V), IGHV lost its significance as a predictor of PFS (versus cCD20 or cCD52), thereby indicating that, in comparison with IGHV, cCD20 and cCD52 may be better prognostic factors for PFS. In addition to PFS and OS, we also analysed the association of CD5/CD19, cCD20 and cCD52 levels with MRD. There was a significant association between CD5/CD19 level (categorized as low, intermediate and high) and PCR for MRD (P = 0 0002, Fisher's exact test) as well as a significant association between blood (P = 0 03, Kruskal-Wallis test) and BM (P = 0 006, Kruskal-Wallis test) cCD52 at response assessment and PCR for MRD (data not shown). \",\n"," 'There were no significant associations between PCR for MRD and blood (P = 0 65, Kruskal-Wallis test) and BM (P = 0 56, Kruskal-Wallis test) cCD20 levels at response assessment (data not shown). We are prospectively studying the role of CD20 and CD52 in the detection of MRD, in comparison with the more standard approaches, which include four-colour flow cytometry (CD5, CD19, CD43 and CD20) and allele-specific PCR. In summary, cCD20 and cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment had prognostic value in previously treated patients receiving FCR and potentially other treatment regimens. Elevated cCD20 or cCD52 levels at the time of response assessment following treatment with FCR indicate higher likelihood for relapse or shorter survival; in such cases additional treatment may be warranted. ',\n"," 'Alemtuzumab is highly effective at treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in bone marrow, which is the usual site of residual disease after fludarabine-based treatment. Eliminating residual disease potentially is associated with longer remission and overall survival. The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease. Patients in partial remission (PR), nodular PR (nPR), or complete remission (CR) who had disease in bone marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks, and patients had the option to self-administer alemtuzumab. Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR, patients in nPR who converted to a CR, and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment. There were 31 patients enrolled, of whom 29 were evaluable, and there were 23 responders (4 of 4 patients who achieved a CR, 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR, and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR. Non-responders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment. Furthermore, higher plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration. Compared with the results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was a trend toward a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab. The current results demonstrated that self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to monitor in future alemtuzumab consolidation trials. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who achieve complete remission (CR) or nodular partial remission (nPR) according to 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria have longer remission duration and survival than patients who achieve partial remission (PR) or who fail to respond to treatment. Molecular analysis for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene and 4-color flow cytometry analysis are more sensitive than morphologic evaluation of the bone marrow used to establish CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. A study by Moreton et al of alemtuzumab administered to previously treated patients with CLL demonstrated that those who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-free status according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis had longer survival. This suggested that evaluating for MDR-free status could add to response evaluation. ',\n"," 'Studies in fludarabine-refractory, previously treated, and treatment-naive patients with CLL clearly demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous alemtuzumab. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab is effective in fludarabine-refractory patients and as initial treatment for patients with CLL. Previously, we reported results from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of alemtuzumab intravenously 3 times weekly for 4 to 8 weeks in eliminating residual disease after treatment with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. That study demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% in 41 patients; the median response duration was not reached at a median follow-up of 18 months. Here, we report the results with subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease and include a retrospective evaluation of bone marrow for MRD by 4-color flow cytometry analysis and end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels. Furthermore, we compare outcomes between the subcutaneous alemtuzumab group and an updated historic group of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab. This was a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the CLL Research Consortium. Patients were enrolled from March 2005 to May 2007, including 16 patients at The University of Texas M. Anderson Cancer Center, 11 patients at University of California-San Diego, and 4 patients at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. All respective institutional review boards approved the protocol and the informed consent form. All participants provided informed consent according to institutional guidelines. Patients with CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia were aged >18 years, had a performance status between 0 and 2, had adequate liver and kidney function (creatinine, total bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels all <=2 times the upper limit of normal), and achieved CR, nPR, or PR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria with their most recent treatment. Patients in CR were required to have a residual population of cluster of differentiation 5 (CD5)-positive/CD19-positive cells that comprised >=10% of the bone marrow mononuclear population or CD5-positive/CD19-positive cells that comprised <10% of the bone marrow mononuclear population with a kappa/lambda ratio of >6 or <0.33, respectively. Patients were excluded for active infection, history of anaphylaxis with rodent-derived monoclonal antibodies, prior treatment with alemtuzumab, pregnancy, corticosteroids, and uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Patients could not have received treatment for CLL within 2 months of enrollment; there was no upper limit for the time from last chemotherapy. The trial intended to enroll 25 patients in nPR or PR and 25 patients in CR. ',\n"," 'accrue and, as a result, was closed. The current analysis includes 26 patients who were enrolled in the nPR/PR group and 5 patients who were enrolled in the CR group. Patients were registered in the CLL Research Consortium database, and all data were collected through the web-based clinical database system. Upon enrollment, patients underwent complete history and physical examination, pretreatment laboratory evaluation (including blood chemistries and blood count), and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Some patients had prognostic factors evaluated, including IGHV mutation status and leukemia cell expression of zeta chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) and CD38 (in respective clinical laboratories), by flow cytometry. Treatment consisted of single-agent, subcutaneous alemtuzumab at doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on Days 1, 2, and 3, respectively, followed by 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for a total of 12 doses, including the initial dose escalation. The research nurses with previously prepared educational materials taught patients self-administration. Once patients demonstrated self-administration to the staff, this was continued for the duration of treatment. Dosing, injection site, and toxicities were documented by patients with diaries, which were submitted for review and documentation at the end of treatment. Premedications consisted of 25 mg to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 650 mg oral acetaminophen. In addition, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily, 3 times weekly, or he equivalent for Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis and valacyclovir 500 mg daily or valganciclovir 450 mg twice daily for viral prophylaxis were given for the duration of treatment and for a minimum of 3 months after completing alemtuzumab. Responses to treatment were assessed within 4 weeks of the end of treatment, and patients could receive a second 4-week course if residual disease was documented at their first response assessment. Criteria for response were as follows: Patients who enrolled in CR were considered responders if they had no disease detected on 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analyses after treatment; specifically, 2-color flow cytometry bone marrow analysis could not demonstrate any kappa:lambda skewing (3:1 or 1:3) regardless of the proportion of cells that coexpressed CD5 and CD19. For patients who enrolled in nPR, responders must have achieved CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who enrolled in PR, responders must have achieved either nPR or CR according to 1996 NCI-WG criteria. For patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab, response was assessed after the second course. ',\n"," 'Patients had a physician visit at least every 3 months after response assessment and underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at least every 6 months to evaluate for loss of response. Time to loss of response and survival were dated from study enrollment. Loss of response was defined for patients who enrolled in CR as the loss of 2-color flow cytometry response in bone marrow, or developing nodules, or >=30% lymphocytes in bone marrow, or lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly; for patients who enrolled in nPR, loss of response was defined as redeveloping criteria for nPR or for PR; and, for patients who enrolled in PR, loss of response was defined as redeveloping criteria for PR. Plasma alemtuzumab levels were assessed retrospectively at the end of treatment using the flow cytometry-based method developed by Rebello and Hale. Bone marrow samples that were cryopreserved at response assessment were evaluated retrospectively for MRD by standardized 4-color flow cytometry (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, Mass). Patients also were evaluated for antialemtuzumab antibodies (BioAnalab Limited, Oxford Science Park, United Kingdom), and none were positive after treatment (data not shown). We previously conducted a trial of intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease that enrolled 41 patients. The trial was revised to enroll an additional 17 patients among CLL Research Consortium clinical sites. We updated follow-up of all 58 patients to include response duration and survival (Table 1). This group was used as an historic intravenous alemtuzumab comparison group. Associations between categorical patient characteristics were evaluated with the Fisher exact test. Comparisons of measured data between the subcutaneous cohort and the intravenous cohort, as well as comparisons between responders and nonresponders, used either the 2-sample t test or its nonparametric alternative, the Wilcoxon ranksum test. The distribution of time to loss of response and survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier curves for categorical variables were plotted for recurrence-free survival. The P values for testing differences between subgroups/levels for each variable were calculated by using log-rank tests. Time intervals were measured from the first day of treatment until progression, recurrence, or death; and deaths from all causes were included. There were 31 patients enrolled who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab, including 17 patients in PR, 9 patients in nPR, and 5 patients in CR (Table 1). ',\n"," 'The median age was 65 years (range, 48-84 years), the median number of previous treatments was 1 (range, 1-6 previous treatments), and the time from last treatment to alemtuzumab was 7.6 months (range, 2-45 months). All patients who had previously received a fludarabine-based regimen were at least 4 months from treatment (data not shown). Enrollment status according to the last treatment regimen and response to that regimen are shown in Table 2. The ORR was 74% (90% exact binomial confidence interval, 58%-86%). Seven patients received a second alemtuzumab course (Table 3). There was 1 death (a patient in PR) that occurred within 1 month of the last alemtuzumab dose because of refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and 1 patient was lost to followup (a patient in CR); neither patient could be evaluated for response, and both were included in the denominator for ORR. All 4 evaluable patients who enrolled in CR were responders to subcutaneous alemtuzumab according to specified criteria (Table 4). Eight of 9 patients who enrolled in nPR and 11 of 17 patients who enrolled in PR responded to subcutaneous alemtuzumab treatment. Four-color flow cytometry analysis was performed retrospectively on cryopreserved bone marrow samples that were obtained at response assessment for 22 of the evaluable patients (Table 4). Two of 4 patients who enrolled in CR had post-treatment bone marrow MR Devaluations, and neither was MRD-negative at end of treatment. Twenty-nine percent of 7 patients who enrolled in nPR and 18% of 13 patients who enrolled in PR were MRD-negative according to 4-color flow cytometry analysis at response assessment. Alemtuzumab therapy was highly effective at eliminating morphologic evidence of residual disease from blood and bone marrow and was less effective at treating residual lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1). The median plasma alemtuzumab concentration at the end of treatment was significantly higher (P = .003) for responders (n = 19; mean concentration, 9.3 microg/mL) than for nonresponders (n = 6; mean concentration, 0.1 microg/mL) (Fig. 2). Among the responders who were evaluated, the end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab concentration was correlated with response duration (Fig. 3A). The overall median plasma level was 6 microg/mL. Significantly longer response duration was observed for responders who had alemtuzumab levels above the median (P = .05). ',\n"," 'The mean alemtuzumab plasma concentration at the end of treatment for the 19 patients who received 1 course of alemtuzumab was 7.7 +- 4.7 microg/mL compared with 2.6 +- 3.8 microg/mL for the 6 patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab. The response rate for the 6 patients who received 2 courses was 50% versus 84% for the 19 patients who received 1 course of subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Responses were evaluated according to pretreatment prognostic factor status, and none of the factors correlated with response or response duration, possibly because of the small patient numbers (Table 5). The median followup is 31 months, and the median response duration is 13 months. Five patients have died, including 1 patient with refractory AIHA, as mentioned above, and 4 patients during follow-up 27 to 31 months after treatment on this study, all with progressive, refractory CLL. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 6). Patients were able to self-administer alemtuzumab without complication or difficulties, as documented by their diaries. Injection site reactions (grade 1 or 2), consisting of erythema, pruritus, and induration that typically lasted 2 or 3 days with complete resolution, were reported by 24 patients (most were grade 1). Four patients experienced serious infections associated with neutropenia; 2 patients developed pneumonia, 1 patient developed gram-positive bacteremia, and 1 patient developed fever of unknown origin. All serious infections occurred within 2 months of completing alemtuzumab and were not associated with plasma alemtuzumab levels greater than the median (6 microg/mL) at the end of treatment. Two patients developed symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation that required ganciclovir treatment, and 1 patient developed a fever and was treated empirically for presumed CMV reactivation. Hematologic toxicities consisted of neutropenia, which was grade 3 in 19% of patients and grade 4 in 19% of patients. Grade 3 anemia was noted in 3% of patients, and no grade >=3 thrombocytopenia was observed. These hematologic toxicities were attributed to treatment with alemtuzumab and were not associated with increased end-of-treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels (Table 6). There were 4 serious adverse events, all of which occurred at the end of alemtuzumab treatment or within 1 month of completion. One patient developed uncontrolled hemolytic anemia during treatment and died (Table 6), as mentioned above. One patient developed neutropenic fever and was admitted to the hospital; blood cultures grew Staphylococcus hominis, and the infection was treated and resolved. ',\n"," 'One patient was admitted and treated with empiric antibiotics for neutropenic fever. Radiographs revealed no source of infection, and cultures remained negative; the fever resolved with antibiotics (Table 6). The same patient experienced a second event of pneumonia with an infiltrate observed on a chest x-ray in the setting of neutropenia that was treated and resolved. There were no reported late infections or infection-related deaths. Response and response duration, as defined for the subcutaneous population, for 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease was updated (Table 1). The characteristics of this group were similar to those of the 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab with the after noted differences: The intravenous group received fewer courses of alemtuzumab, was younger, had lower platelet count, and had higher beta-2 microglobulin levels at enrollment (Table 1). The proportion of patients with lymphadenopathy before alemtuzumab was similar between the groups (Table 1). Among the patients who had lymphadenopathy, 60% of those in the subcutaneous group and 52% of those in the intravenous group had more than 1 involved lymph node site. Furthermore, the largest lymph node measured >=2 cm in 50% of those in the subcutaneous group and in 31% of those in the intravenous group. The ORR using the same criteria was lower (P = .07) for the patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab (Table 1). However, among the responders, the proportion of patients who had MRD-negative bone marrow status was significantly higher (P = .005) in the intravenous group, although the method used to evaluate MRD differed between trials; 4-color flow cytometry analysis was used in the subcutaneous trial, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for the clonal IGHV gene was used in the intravenous trial. There was a trend (P = .07) for shorter response duration, when using the same criteria for both trials, for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab (median response duration, 13 months vs 31 months, respectively) (Fig. 3B). There was no difference in overall survival between the trials at the most recent follow-up (data not shown). Investigators have evaluated strategies to achieve MRD-free status by incorporating alemtuzumab into the approach with the expectation that this may translate into longer remission duration and survival. The phase 3 trial of the German CLL Study Group clearly demonstrated longer progression-free survival for patients who received alemtuzumab. ',\n"," 'That trial demonstrated a high response rate of 74%, although the response duration was disappointing. There was an apparently shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab compared with the that reported in the historic intravenous trial. The characteristics of the patients were similar in our historic comparison group, making it less likely that the shorter response duration was caused by differences in patient characteristics. The shorter response may have been caused by the reduced ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to clear MRD when given for the defined treatment period. In both trials, patients received a 4-week course of alemtuzumab (12 doses) with the option for a second 4-week course for patients who had residual CLL after the first course. Fewer patients received a second course of alemtuzumab on the intravenous trial. Also, the proportion of responders who were negative for MRD was lower for patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab versus intravenous alemtuzumab. One difficulty in interpreting this observation is that the methods for evaluating MRD were different between trials. For the subcutaneous trial, 4-color flow cytometry was used to evaluate MRD, which potentially has different sensitivity than the PCR-based assay that was used to evaluate patients in the intravenous trial. Also, these trials were not contemporaneous but sequential; therefore, unappreciated trial effects may account in part for the differences in response duration between the patient populations. A major concern for the use of alemtuzumab in residual disease is infection, including CMV reactivation and opportunistic infections. The German CLL Study Group had to terminate their phase 3 trial, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B terminated their phase 2 trial of alemtuzumab for MRD, both because of unacceptable, infection-related toxicity. One possible explanation for this observation was a shorter duration between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that alemtuzumab can be self-administered safely by patients with residual disease, with the expected reactivation of CMV in a minority of patients. The incidence of symptomatic CMV reactivation on this trial was lower than previously reported, likely because some patients received valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis. Reactivation of CMV can be minimized, if not eliminated, with prophylactic valganciclovir. It is possible that trials of alemtuzumab for residual disease that reported serious and, in some cases, fatal infectious complications were the result of allowing too little time for immune reconstitution between fludarabine-based chemotherapy and the initiation of alemtuzumab. ',\n"," 'In our previous trial of 58 patients who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in the current trial with 31 patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was no treatment-related, infectious mortality. The median time from fludarabine-based therapy to alemtuzumab was >6 months, and we recommend waiting at least 4 to 6 months before initiating alemtuzumab to minimize infectious complications. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to report the self-administration of subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Patients were taught to self-administer alemtuzumab and were able to complete the treatment without complication or incident. Subcutaneous alemtuzumab was associated with local injection-site reactions, but these were mild and were minimized by supportive measures, such as applying ice before and after the injection and administering acetaminophen and diphenhydramine premedication. In the current trial, plasma alemtuzumab levels were correlated with response and response duration. There are limited reports of single-agent alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics. It is noteworthy that Hale et al evaluated the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in 30 patients with recurrent disease who received intravenous alemtuzumab and in 20 untreated patients who received subcutaneous alemtuzumab. Their analysis indicated significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters; however, the mean cumulative dose of alemtuzumab that was needed to reach a trough serum concentration of 1 microg/mL was 90mg for the intravenous group and was substantially higher at 551 mg for the subcutaneous group. Furthermore, higher trough serum alemtuzumab concentrations were correlated significantly with a better clinical response and with achieving MRD-free status. Montillo et al evaluated pharmacokinetics in 16 patients who received alemtuzumab 10 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6 weeks as treatment for residual disease. Their data indicated that patients who achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on Day 15 of therapy that was >5 microg hour/mL were more likely to achieve CR compared with individuals who had lower levels. In our study, patients who did not achieve a response had lower plasma levels of alemtuzumab at the end of treatment compared with responders. Furthermore, among the responders, those with end-of-treatment alemtuzumab levels lower than the median of 6 microg/mL had significantly shorter response duration than patients who had levels higher than the median. ',\n"," 'Given the significantly higher cumulative dose of subcutaneous alemtuzumab needed to achieve blood concentrations associated with response, we hypothesize that optimized treatment and improved safety and responses, specifically MRD-free status, could be achieved better by evaluating for MRD in a real-time fashion and administering individualized alemtuzumab subcutaneously or intravenously based on blood levels. Because blood reveals only 1 disease compartment, a time factor to allow for compartment equilibration is yet another consideration. Further work to optimize this treatment strategy may make use of a new trial design in which patients have blood alemtuzumab levels measured and undergo real-time evaluations for MRD. Patients could begin with a 4-week course (12 doses of 30 mg) of subcutaneous alemtuzumab followed by evaluations of response, MRD, and blood drug levels. For patients with residual disease, treatment could continue, and the subcutaneous alemtuzumab dose or schedule could be adjusted, depending on blood drug levels; then, treatment would continue with monthly bone marrow evaluations either until patients achieved negative MRD status or a predetermined total duration of treatment is reached for patients who remain positive with potentially adequate blood alemtuzumab levels. This remains an interesting, active, and promising therapeutic strategy for patients with CLL. ',\n"," 'Flavopiridol and lenalidomide have activity in refractory CLL without immunosuppression or opportunistic infections seen with other therapies. We hypothesized that flavopiridol treatment could adequately de-bulk disease prior to lenalidomide therapy, decreasing the incidence of tumor flare with higher doses of lenalidomide. In this Phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached with treatment consisting of flavopiridol 30 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (IVB) + 30 mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) cycle (C) 1 day (D) 1 and 30 mg/m2 IVB + 50 mg/m2 CIVI C1 D8,15 and C2-8 D3,10,17 with lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily C2-8 D1-21. There was no unexpected toxicity seen, including no increased tumor lysis, tumor flare (even at higher doses of lenalidomide) or opportunistic infection. Significant clinical activity was demonstrated, with a 51% response rate in this group of heavily pretreated patients. Biomarker testing confirmed association of mitochondrial priming of the BH3 only peptide Puma with response. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia, characterized by leukemic cells accumulating secondary to survival and proliferation signals delivered to the cells. CLL has been increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease, with many patients being observed for several years after diagnosis prior to disease progression requiring therapy. Certain disease characteristics such as high-risk interphase cytogenetic abnormalities (del17p13 and del11q22) and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain-variable status are associated with a more rapid progression and inferior survival. Despite the improvement in overall response rates with the current standard treatment using combination chemoimmunotherapy, patients with the mentioned high-risk characteristics continue to have shorter time to progression with conventional therapies and lower response rates with repeated therapy. CLL cell survival has been attributed to a role of proliferation and also disordered apoptosis, with constitutive expression of different anti-apoptotic proteins including BCl2, MCL1 and XIAP. Contributions of the microenvironment and aberrations in innate immune response are recognized as CLL survival mechanisms. Significant survival signals are derived from both direct contact of CLL cells with stromal cells and cytokines, making development of novel therapeutics targeting the molecular alterations preventing apoptosis and the immunoregulatory defects interesting therapeutic targets. Two promising agents that either down-regulate MCL-1 or favorably enhance immune effector cell function include lenalidomide and flavopiridol. Both drugs have shown single agent activity in phase I and II trials in this population of patients. ',\n"," \"Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved for the treatment of 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma with activity in other hematologic malignancies including CLL. Lenalidomide does not promote direct cytotoxicity to CLL cells but does alter the microenvironment and immune regulation. Lenalidomide promotes cellular and innate immune activation, activates T-cells and natural killer cells altering the tumor microenvironment and down-regulates critical pro-survival cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The optimal dose and schedule of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory CLL patients is controversial due to the risks of tumor flare reaction and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Two phase II trials with single agent lenalidomide administered at doses of 10-25 mg daily in relapsed/refractory CLL reported response rates ranging from 32-47% with clinical activity in patients with high-risk cytogenetics and/or bulky disease. Tumor flare was reported in 30-58% of these patients and two cases of TLS were reported at the 25 mg daily dose. A phase 2/3 study was planned to address the question of optimal dosing comparing 10 mg versus 25 mg orally daily for 21 of 28 days; however, after four patients experienced sever tumor flare and /or TLS, the study was amended to a phase 1 trial with intra-patient-dose escalation with lenalidomide given at 2.5 mg initially, increasing to 5 mg after 28 days with subsequent 5 mg incremental increases to 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg. In that study, one-third of the patients could not escalate beyond 2.5 mg, and the response rate was only 11.5%, much lower than previously described. Flavopiridol is a broad cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, that directly antagonizes cell cycle CDK's (CDK 1 and 2) and those involved in transcription initiation (CDK 7 and 8) and elongation (CDK9). Flavopiridol induced apoptosis in CLL cell lines and primary human CLL cells, which was independent of p53. Flavopiridol also globally inhibits gene transcription, potentially leading to down-regulation of several important intracellular proteins in CLL including Mcl-1 and XIAP. Despite promising pre-clinical data, initial clinical trials of flavopiridol using a 72-hour continuous infusion, 24-hour continuous infusion and 1-hour bolus infusion were disappointing with limited clinical efficacy, likely due to plasma protein binding and sub-optimal exposure of free drug. \",\n"," 'scheduling to a 30-minute bolus (IVB) followed by 4-hour continuous infusion (CIV) weekly improved efficacy in a Phase I trial with 42 patients enrolled in 3 separate cohorts. Nineteen (45%) patients achieved a partial response to therapy with responses noted in the high risk patients, including 51% of patients with bulky lymphadenopathy, 42% of those with del(17p13.1) and 72% of those with del(11q22.3). The dose limiting toxicity was acute TLS requiring dialysis, occurring in 14% of patients, but 63% of those with WBC > 200x109/L. A Phase II trial followed, restricting eligibility to patients with < 200x109/L and using aggressive TLS prophylaxis with hydration, rasburicase, IV dexamethasone, frequent monitoring for and treatment of hyperkalemia. A total of 64 patients were enrolled with only 4 patients not being treated with dose escalation for severe TLS, 3 of those requiring hemodialysis. Thirty-four (53%) patients achieved a response to therapy with 12 (57%) of patients with del(17p13.1) and 14(50%) of patients with del(11q22.3) responding. Subsequent data analysis from these earlier trials evaluating flavopiridol in relapsed or refractory CLL patients identified female sex, bulky lymphadenopathy, high WBC, beta-2-microglobulin, and high exposure to flavopiridol-glucuronide as risk factors for TLS. Flavopiridol plasma exposure was only weakly associated with response. It is unclear if Mcl-1 down-regulation is solely responsible for the rapid tumor cell death observed in a subset of CLL patients or if other factors are important, such as priming for early mitochondrial damage. Given the promising efficacy of both of these agents in high risk and refractory patients coupled with the fact that neither agent was immunosuppressive nor associated with opportunistic infections, we elected to perform a phase I trial evaluating the potential synergy of direct flavopiridol-induced CLL cell cytotoxicity with indirect lenalidomide immunomodulatory effects. Based on the apparent opposite mechanisms for severe toxicities (i.e. tumor flare for lenalidomide vs. TLS for flavopirodol), we hypothesized dosing with single agent flavopiridol during cycle 1 with the established phase II dose would sufficiently de-bulk patients thus reducing risk for tumor flare when combined with escalating doses of lenalidomide in later cycles. Finally, we retrospectively evaluated several factors as potential biomarkers for outcomes from this combined therapy, including mitochondrial profiling of BH3-domain proteins, a functional assay surrogate for cellular ability to respond to pro-apoptotic cues. ',\n"," 'All patients were enrolled and treated on the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored (NCI 8046, U01CA076576, NCT00735930) and The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSU) institutional review board-approved phase I trial of flavopiridol in combination with lenalidomide in previously treated CLL. Written informed consent approved by The Ohio State University Human Studies committee was obtained for all patients prior to study entry. The study enrolled adult patients (>= 18 years of age) with relapsed and refractory CLL that required therapy by the IWCLL 2008 criteria. Other eligibility included: at least one prior therapy that included fludarabine unless a contra-indication existed; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <= 2; normal organ and marrow function; no active infection. The study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of flavopiridol and lenalidomide in this population of patients. Due to potential risks of coincident tumor flare and TLS from flavopiridol and lenalidomide administered concomitantly, flavopiridol was administered alone during cycle 1 to cytoreduce patients prior to combination therapy with the two agents during cycles 2-8 (Table 1). Combination therapy and dose escalation was started with the initiation of cycle 2 (Day 29). A standard 3+3 phase I design was used with 3-6 patients enrolled at each dose level with dose escalation starting during cycle 2 (Table 2). Patients were required to complete 2 cycles of therapy with < 2 patients experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) prior to dose escalation to the next dose level. DLT was defined during cycle 2 of protocol treatment (Supplemental Table 1). To minimize risk of TLS, the first dose of flavopiridol on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and day 3 of cycle 2 was administered in the hospital with standard supportive care measures and monitoring for TLS. On days 15 of cycle 1, days 10 and 17 of cycle 2 and days 3, 10 and 17 of cycles 3-8, flavopiridol was administered in the outpatient clinic provided no serious adverse events were noted with the first dose. During cycles 2-8, lenalidomide was administered orally on days 1-21, with flavopiridol dosing immediately after lenalidomide on days 3, 10 and 17. Cycle 1 was defined as 28 days and starting with cycle 2, each cycle was defined as 35 days. Patients who developed a DVT were allowed to continue protocol therapy, but were treated with a low molecular weight heparin. ',\n"," 'In patients who were unable to receive anti-coagulation due to contra-indication (i.e. the platelet count was < 50,000/mm3 or serious bleeding occurred), pulmonary embolism occurred, or a DVT recurred despite anti-coagulation, were removed from protocol therapy. Rasburicase (4.5 mg) was administered two hours prior to flavopiridol on day 1 of cycle 1 and day 3 of cycle 2 with remaining doses left to the discretion of the treating physician. Potassium monitoring was done every two hours prior to, during and one hour following treatment. Dexamethasone 20 mg orally was administered 30 minutes prior to each dose of flavopiridol and 4 mg 24 hours after each dose to prevent flavopiridol-related cytokine mediated infusion reactions. Additional corticosteroids were used at the discretion of the treating physician for patients with flavopiridol-related cytokine release or lenalidomide induced tumor flare. Anti-emetic therapy with ondansetron 8 mg orally was given 30 min prior to each flavopiridol treatment. GCSF (Neulasta) 6mg SQ was administered on day 16 of cycle 1 and day 18 of cycles 2-8. Prophylactic antiviral and antibiotic therapy including valacyclovir, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole DS were continued throughout protocol therapy. DLT was defined during cycle 2 of treatment. Those patients experiencing DLT during cycle 1, who had TLS, or who were unable or unwilling to proceed to cycle 2 were replaced. DLT was defined as the occurrence of any of the following events when considered possibly, probably or definitely related to the study treatment including 1) treatment delays > 14 days for any non-hematologic or hematologic toxicity or any grade 5 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity; 2) hematologic toxicities including grade 4 febrile neutropenia or infection, grade 3 febrile neutropenia or infection with fever or infection that fails to resolve within 7 days, or ANC < 1000/mm3 or platelets < 30,000/mm3 > 14 days after the completion of cycle 1 or 2 (i.e. day 44 or later after cycle 1 or day 51 or later after cycle 2); and 3) any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity. The following were not considered DLT: TLS, tumor flare reaction, cytokine release syndrome, alopecia, DVT responsive to anticoagulation, diarrhea responsive to medical treatment, and nausea and vomiting controllable with steroids and anti-emetic therapy, transient grade 3 and 4 electrolyte or liver function test (AST, ALT, total bilirubin) abnormalities that resolve <= grade 1 in <= 7 days. ',\n"," \"The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 was used for toxicity grading. Response was assessed by the revised National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group Guidelines for CLL. Response was evaluated after cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 (during days 22-35 of each cycle). Pharmacokinetic evaluations were conducted in collaboration with the Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource at OSU. Pharmacokinetic assessments of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite were completed on cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 2 day 3. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 4.5, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the start of flavopiridol infusion. Pharmacokinetic assessments of lenalidomide were completed during cycle 2 on days 2 and 3. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8 and 24 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of lenalidomide, flavopiridol and flavopiridol glucuronide were simultaneously determined using previously published LC-MS/MS methods. The primary endpoint of the study was to define the MTD of the combination of flavopiridol and lenalidomide using the standard 3+3 phase I design as described above and to define the specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicities of this combination in this population of patients. Common toxicities are summarized with frequency by dose level and for all patients. Baseline characteristics are described using frequencies and medians with ranges for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. PFS was measured from the date on study to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were still alive and didn't have disease progression were censored at the last visit for PFS. OS was determined from the date of study to the date of death from any cause or date of observation. Patients who were still alive were censored at the last visit. Survival curves were estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed in Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3.0.395 and resulting parameters summarized in graphic and tabular format. Thawed aliquots of pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells containing CLL cells were purified for untouched B-cells by non-B-cell depletion using a cocktail of biotinylated monoclonal Abs (CD2, CD4, CD11b, CD16, CD36, Anti-IgE, and CD235a (glycophorin) and magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Of 32 patients treated with lenalidomide and flavopiridol, specimens were available and assessed for 26. \",\n"," 'The extent of cell purification was monitored by flow cytometry of stained cells before and after purification with anti-CD19-APC and anti-biotin antibody-FITC for the presence of non-B cells labeled with MAbs from depletion cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Specimens (2x105 cells/assay) were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated with JC-1 mitochondrial dye and 100 microM BH3 peptides (Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bmf, Hrk; Bim and Puma were also assayed at 0.1 microM and 10 microM, respectively) or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO [(1%]) or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP [10 microM]). Samples were run in triplicate and fluorescent traces of JC-1 dye monitored over 300 min of assay. Area under the curve was integrated relative to the positive control uncoupling reagent after normalization for DMSO background: Association between biomarker status (% priming) and clinical response classification was by Mann-Whitney Test. We pre-determined a statistical analysis plan with significance of p<0.05. Marker predictive ability was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Analyses utilized SAS software, version 9.2 (Cary, NC), R version 2.14.2 (Vienna, Austria), and/or Graphpad Prism version 5.04 (La Jolla, CA). A total of 39 patients were treated on Cohorts 1 (n=8), Cohort 2 (n=9), Cohort 3 (n=4), Cohort 4 (n=4), Cohort 5 (n=10), Cohort 6 (n=4) (Table 2). Median age was 62 years (range 26-74) and there was a male predominance (26). Median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1-10). Patients had the following high-risk features: del(17p13.1) in 22 patients; del(11q22.3) in 15 patients; complex karyotype in 31 patients; fludarabine refractory in 14 patients. Baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 3. Dose limiting toxicities occurred in three patients and included Grade 3-4 transaminitis in two patients, one at dose level 1 and one at dose level two, and grade 3 absolute neutrophil count lasting greater than 14 days in one patient at dose level 5. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hematologic: neutropenia (n=32 or 82%), anemia (n=16 or 41%), thrombocytopenia (n=20 or 51%) and lymphopenia (n=9 or 23%); gastrointestinal: diarrhea (n=18 or 46%); metabolic: transaminitis (n=17 or 44%), hypophosphatemia (n=12 or 31%), hypocalcemia (n=6 or 15%); hypokalemia (n=11 or 28%), hyperkalemia (n=6 or 15%); hyperglycemia (n=17 or 44%) and TLS (n=10 or 26%). TLS occurred only during cycle 1, and three of the patients with TLS were replaced. There was only one patient with Grade 3 tumor flare. ',\n"," 'This patient had lenalidomide held for painful splenomegaly on day 10 of cycle 2 until cycle 3 and was treated with three days of steroids with lenalidomide dose reduced to 7.5 mg for cycle 3. The patient had recurrence of painful splenomegaly on day 10 of cycle 3, and lenalidomide was held again with two days of steroid treatment given. When lenalidomide was restarted at 7.5 mg, the patient again had recurrence of symptoms in four days and was removed from study. A total of fifteen patients required dose reductions. Grade 3-4 adverse events are summarized in Table 4. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine patients were evaluable for response completing at least two cycles. Of the eight patients that were not evaluable for response 2 had progressive disease in cycle 1, 3 were replaced for TLS in cycle 1, 1 had thrombocytopenia after cycle 1 whose platelet count did not recover to > 30,000 prior to cycle 2, and 2 had DLT with transaminitis during cycle 2. Of the thirty-one evaluable patients there was a 51% overall response rate, all of which were partial responses. Of the 22 patients with del(17p13.1), 11 (50%) of patients responded and of the 14 patients with del(11q22.3), 10 (71%) responded. These factors associated with inferior outcome to standard therapy did not show a statistically significant association with response (p value 0.62, 0.14 respectively). Median PFS for all patients was 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.7-11.2). Median PFS for patients with del(17p13.1) was 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.5-13.0) versus 8.6 months (95% CI: 3.0-16.0) for patients without del(17p13.1), showing PFS is not significantly associated with del(17p13.1) (p-value=0.71). Seven patients went on to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Of these seven patients, one was lost to follow-up; one had graft failure with multi-organ failure due to complications and died at 2 months post-transplant; one progressed within 6 months of transplant and died of infectious complications at 11 months post-transplant; one relapsed at 12 months post-transplant and went on to receive three other therapies prior to dying of infectious complications 32 months post-transplant; and at last follow-up three were still alive and without evidence of disease at 35, 37, and 38 months post-transplant. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for flavopiridol pharmacokinetics on cycle 1 day 1 and thirty-two on cycle 2 day 3 (Figure 1). ',\n"," 'Pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide were evaluable for thirty-one patients on cycle 2 day 2 and thirty-two patients on cycle 2 day 3. Average observed maximum concentrations (Cmax) of lenalidomide reached 0.97uM, and the average observed Cmax of flavopiridol was 3.50uM (Figure 1 and Supplemental Material Figure 1). Non-compartmental parameter estimates for clearance, Cmax and volume of distribution were consistent with previously reported values (Table 5). When flavopiridol and lenalidomide were administered in combination, PK plots and parameter estimates of lenalidomide were consistent with those for lenalidomide alone (Supplemental Table 2). At 60 mg/m2, flavopiridol AUC (p=0.03) and Cmax (p=0.01) tended to increase when lenalidomide dose was increased, as shown in Supplemental Table 3. However, this trend was not observed at the higher 80 mg/m2 flavopiridol dose. Flavopiridol-glucuronide data was available from 30 patients. Of the 10 patients with TLS, flavopiridol-glucuronide data was available for 8 patients (data not shown). No trends or significant associations were observed between plasma flavopiridol-glucuronide pharmacokinetics and TLS. From 32 study participants who would be treated with flavopiridol and lenalidomide, aliquots of pre-treatment specimens were available from 26 with defined evaluable outcomes (median age of 60 years [range: 26-74 years]). Specimens were thawed and exposed in vitro to individual BH3 peptides, including an activator (Bim) and several sensitizers (Noxa, Puma, Bad, Hrk) as surrogates for the function of Bcl-2 family proteins. One sample was eliminated from statistical analysis due to insufficient number of viable cells thus yielding 25 specimens with analyzable data. All specimens were analyzed in triplicate, with coefficients of variation (CV) for repeat samples from individual patients generally <5%. The percent priming, i.e. quantifiable propensity of a given BH3 peptide to induce mitochondrial depolarization relative to an uncoupling control agent, for each peptide is summarized in Table 6 separately for patients who responded to study therapy (i.e. achieved partial response) and those who did not respond to treatment (stable disease/progressive disease). Among the peptides assayed, Puma(10) alone elicited a priming trend between responders (32.8 +- 16.5% [mean+-SD]) and non-responders (22.3 +- 9.9%; p= .059); the percent priming with Puma(10) for individual patients is depicted in Figure 2. To test the ability of Puma to serve as a predictive biomarker, we employed the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker, which yielded an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.53-0.94; p=0.027; Figure 2). ',\n"," 'In assessment of patient clinical information (Table 6,) bulky disease of >5 cm trended with patient response (Mann-Whitney p-value =0.088; AUC=0.68 (95% CI: 0.53-0.84), AUC p-value=0.022). We performed adjusted analyses of Puma priming in which we accounted for bulky disease >5 cm as a second covariate. As shown in Figure 2, adjustment for bulky disease (>5 cm) improved the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.99). The AUC p-value =0.0063 was significant for Puma combined with bulky disease (p-value <0.01; p<0.05/5 BH3 profiling biomarkers with Bonferroni correction for multiple analyses). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined flavopiridol and lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory CLL with the hypothesis that higher doses of lenalidomide would be tolerated with less tumor flare observed in patients who received flavopiridol for disease reduction prior to the initiation of lenalidomide. In this Phase I dose-escalation study of combined flavopiridol and lenalidomide in relapsed CLL, the MTD was not reached with the highest dose being given at dose level 6 with treatment of flavopiridol given in cycle 1 at a dose of 30 mg/m2 IVB + 30 mg/m2 CIVI day 1 of cycle 1 and 30 mg/m2 IVB + 50 mg/m2 CIVI day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 3, 10 and 17 of cycles 2-8 immediately after lenalidomide dosing and lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily days 1-21 of cycles 2-8. There was no unexpected toxicity seen, including no increased risk of TLS, tumor flare, or opportunistic infection. Significant clinical activity was demonstrated, with a 51% response rate in this group of relapsed, heavily pretreated patients. The response rate was not affected by the presence of high-risk genomic features, with a 50% response rate in patients with del(17p13.1) and a 71% response rate in patients with del(11q22.3). Additionally, seven patients (18%) were able to proceed with allogeneic stem cell transplant, a potentially curative therapy in these poor-risk patients. Three patients remained without evidence of disease at 3 years post-transplant. Ten (26%) of patients did experience grade 3-4 TLS, all occurring in cycle 1 of therapy with 3 of these patients being replaced. This was a slightly lower rate of TLS compared to previous studies. Furthermore, unlike those previous studies, which revealed higher rates of TLS in female CLL patients, TLS in this study appeared evenly distributed between males (7/26, 27%) and females (3/13, 23%). ',\n"," 'Furthermore, unlike previous studies that revealed significant associations between TLS and flavopiridol glucuronide exposures, we found no such associations in this study. Only one patient (3%) experienced grade 3 tumor flare and was unable to continue with lenalidomide therapy due to symptoms, despite being able to reach a dose of 15 mg orally of lenalidomide in Cycles 2-8. In prior studies using single agent lenalidomide at doses of 10-25 mg daily in relapsed CLL, 30-60% of patients experienced tumor flare. Two separate phase I studies had to modify the planned study to reduce the dose of lenalidomide from 10-15 mg daily initial dose down to a dose of 2.5 mg daily due to serious tumor flare. It may be possible to further increase lenalidomide dosing in these patients that have received cytoreduction prior to lenalidomide initiation. Biomarker testing yielded interesting results for association of mitochondrial priming (BH3 profiling) of the BH3 only peptide Puma with response. A pro-apoptotic modulator of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Puma functions as a general sensitizer. As such, Puma may not be used to specifically address whether a malignancy is driven by specific anti-apoptotic BH3 proteins, but rather it displays a global propensity of cells to respond to intrinsic pro-apoptotic cues. Previous BH3 profiling studies established that flavopiridol response in CLL patients was Bcl-xL dependent. It is perhaps not surprising that a more complex combination treatment comprising therapies with different mechanisms would be associated with a BH3 peptide that modulates multiple anti-apoptotic proteins. Further, while we would classify this as a trend between Puma profiling and response (Mann-Whitney p = 0.059; AUC p=0.027) the observation is interesting when placed in the context of the dose escalation component of the study design. Further, Puma priming when combined with bulky disease as a clinical adjustment variable displayed significant association with response (p=0.0063) indicating that additional observation may be warranted in follow-on CLL clinical studies with uniformly defined treatment regimens comprising lenalidomide and flavopiridol. In summary, this phase I dose escalation study demonstrates that the combination of flavopiridol and oral lenalidominde is feasible and well tolerated in heavily pretreated CLL patients. By treating patients with flavopiridol prior to lenalidomide therapy to decrease tumor burden, patients were able to tolerate higher doses of lenalidomide and only one patient experienced tumor flare. ',\n"," 'We evaluated the safety and biologic activity of the BH3 mimetic protein, navitoclax, combined with rituximab, in comparison to rituximab alone. One hundred and eighteen patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were randomized to receive eight weekly doses of rituximab (arm A), eight weekly doses of rituximab plus daily navitoclax for 12 weeks (arm B) or eight weekly doses of rituximab plus daily navitoclax until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (arm C). Investigator-assessed overall response rates (complete [CR] and partial [PR]) were 35% (arm A), 55% (arm B, p = 0.19 vs. A) and 70% (arm C, p = 0.0034 vs. A). Patients with del(17p) or high levels of BCL2 had significantly better clinical responses when treated with navitoclax. Navitoclax in combination with rituximab was well tolerated as initial therapy for patients with CLL, yielded higher response rates than rituximab alone and resulted in prolonged progression-free survival with treatment beyond 12 weeks. Apoptosis is an interplay between pro-survival proteins and pro-apoptosis proteins in the BCL2 family of proteins. The overexpression of BCL2 anti-apoptotic proteins sequesters pro-apoptotic proteins of the same family, leading to enhanced cell survival. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, thereby enhancing the capacity of CLL cells to resist spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. BH3 mimetics are a class of drugs designed to compete for the BH3-binding pocket in pro-survival proteins to displace sequestered pro-apoptosis proteins. ABT-737 is a small molecule inhibitor that mimics the BH3 protein, BAD, by binding to BCL2, BCLXL or BCLW, and thereby antagonizing their capacity to sequester pro-apoptosis proteins. CLL is responsive to ABT-737, and a mechanistic dissection points specifically to its ability to displace BIM from BCL2 where it is constitutively sequestered. ABT-737 has been developed into a second-generation, orally available therapeutic agent, ABT-263 (navitoclax), with similar binding properties. In addition to expressing high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, CLL cells also express high levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, making CLL cells particularly sensitive to inhibition of BCL2 by navitoclax. Navitoclax can enhance the anti-leukemia activity of rituximab, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in vitro. CLL cells that express high levels of BCL2, or that have a high ratio of BCL2 to MCL1 or other BCL2 family members, appear most sensitive to navitoclax or ABT-737. ',\n"," 'In a phase 1 study, patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who were treated with navitoclax had a 35% overall response rate (ORR). Study-emergent thrombocytopenia was managed through the implementation of a lead-in period, and neutropenia was reversible with dose reduction or administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Based on the single-agent data, the present study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biologic activity of navitoclax and rituximab versus rituximab alone, in the initial therapy of patients with CLL. An open-label phase 2, randomized three-arm, multicenter trial was performed in patients with CLL (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01087151). Patients provided written informed consent, and protocol approvals were obtained from national health authorities and independent ethics committees for each site. The study was conducted at 47 sites in nine countries in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria as the time from study entry until objective disease progression or death. Patients aged >= 18 years were eligible if they had previously untreated CLL that required treatment according to iwCLL criteria; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 due to CLL; and adequate marrow, renal and hepatic function (baseline platelet counts > 75 000/mm to allow for drug-related thrombocytopenia, hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count >= 1000/muL, serum creatinine <= 2.0 mg/dL or measured clearance >= 50 mL/min, alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase/alkaline phosphatase [ALT/AST/ALP] <=3.0 times the upper limit of normal [ULN], bilirubin <=1.5 x ULN unless Gilbert syndrome present, activated partial thromboplastin time/prothrombin time <=1.2 x ULN). Exclusion criteria included receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin), drugs that affect platelet function (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel), active infection or chronic viral infection (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]). Patients were stratified by Binet stage and high-risk cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion). Patients self-administered ABT-263 in liquid or tablet form, on a daily basis. Rituximab infusion occurred on a weekly basis in the infusion room of each participating site. ',\n"," '1 week [week 1], then 250 mg daily x 12 weeks) and arm C (rituximab 375 mg/m2 week 1, 500 mg/m2 each week 2-8, plus navitoclax 100 mg daily x 1 week [week 1], then 250 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). The rituximab dose chosen for investigation (500 mg/m2 subsequent to an initial dose of 375 mg/m2) is similar to that used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosph-amide, which resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patient outcomes. Patients randomized to ABT-263 arms B and C received the \"lead-in\" dose of 100 mg/day ABT-263 identified in the phase 1 study, followed by the final dose of 250 mg/day. The lead-in dose period lasted 8-15 days and was intended to allow for monitoring of the effects of low-dose ABT-263 on the platelet counts of treated patients. Patients enrolled in arm A who experienced disease progression at least 2 months after the last rituximab infusion were eligible for cross-over to arm B (rituximab for 8 weeks plus navitoclax daily for 12 weeks). Due to the mechanistic and early effect of navitoclax on platelet counts, it was not practical to treat patients enrolled in the rituximab-only arm with a placebo in blinded fashion. Patients on arm C who were responding to navitoclax were given the option to continue on a roll-over protocol for continued navitoclax treatment once they discontinued from the study. The ABT-263 was continued until disease progression or for 1 year, whichever came first. No further efficacy outcomes were collected on these patients. Safety was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) (version 4.0) for the standardized classification of adverse events (AEs) of drugs used in cancer therapy. Special emphasis was focused on grade >= 3 AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and grade >= 3 laboratory toxicities, and relationship to study treatment. An Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) conducted a formal safety data review from the first 30 patients treated on the combination arms B and C before additional enrollment was allowed. Thereafter, safety review meetings by the IMC were required approximately every 6 months. Navitoclax and rituximab pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were obtained at multiple visits throughout the study. ',\n"," 'Navitoclax plasma PK samples were obtained coincident with the week 1, lead-in day 5 dose: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-dose; and on week 8, day 1: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-dose in arm B and arm C. Pre-infusion and post-infusion rituximab samples were obtained on day 1 at weeks 2, 4 and 8, and rituximab concentrations were subsequently followed at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24. Navitoclax concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method. Rituximab concentrations in serum were analyzed using a validated immunoassay. Baseline bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) were collected by optional consent from patients randomly assigned to one of the three arms of this study. Protein expression of BCL2 and related family proteins were measured by intracellular staining after gating on CD19/CD5 positive CLL cells in a flow assisted cell sorting assay on fresh samples run at a central laboratory (Esoterix, Inc.) (LabCorp Clinical Trials, Cranford, NJ) within 72 h of sample collection. The following analytes were evaluated in BMAs by flow cytometry for statistical analysis: BCL2, BCLXL, MCL1, A1, BIM and NOXA, and the ratios of BCL2/MCL1 and BCLXL/MCL1. BMAs were also examined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for cytogenetic features (17p deletion and/or 11q deletion). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD), relapse or death on study from any cause within 12 weeks of last tumor assessment. The study investigators assessed for clinical response using the updated iwCLL criteria. Response was assessed at week 12, and every 12 weeks during follow-up. This trial was designed to estimate the magnitude of treatment effect rather than for formal hypothesis testing. The study was originally planned to enroll 120 patients to observe approximately 72 investigator-assessed PFS events across the three treatment arms combined. Due to early discontinuation of the trial, the final study data for analysis included only 27 patients who had experienced a PFS event instead of the planned 72 patients. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm. Objective response, defined as a complete or partial response according to the modified iwCLL criteria, was estimated, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each treatment arm. ',\n"," 'The difference in objective response rate between the treatment arms was also calculated along with the 95% confidence intervals. p-Values for treatment group comparison were based on chi2 tests. Due to the explorative nature of the study, no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. Biomarker subgroups were derived by the median value of expression for each biomarker. Biomarker analysis was intended to evaluate the correlation between BCL2 levels with efficacy outcomes. Since biomarker data were available for only a small subset of patients, arms B and C were pooled to provide a larger number of patients receiving combination treatment for comparison with rituximab alone. Odds ratios of an objective response were calculated between treatment arms (arm A vs. arm B and arm C combined) for biomarker low and high groups. Logistic regression was used for each biomarker and expression subgroup. Baseline characteristics were compared between treatment arms. The sponsor provided study drug and collaborated with investigators on study design, collection, analysis and interpretation of data, writing the report and the decision to submit the paper for publication. The corresponding author had full access to all the data. This study enrolled a total of 118 patients (Figure 1), who had (Table I) a median baseline lymphocyte count of 53 000/mm3 (range 7000-552 000/mm3), median age of 63 years and 55% Binet stage B + C disease. Baseline characteristics and prognostic factors of patients randomly assigned to each arm were generally balanced between each of the treatment groups. FISH analyses of pretreatment samples revealed that 31% or 28% of patients had CLL cells with deletions in 11q or 17p, respectively. While neither safety nor toxicity was an issue, the study ended prematurely, as the sponsor decided instead to develop a more selective BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, which appeared less likely than navitoclax to induce thrombocytopenia, but that still could selectively dissociate BCL2/BIM heterodimers. All patients had either completed their treatment period or were allowed to continue on navitoclax at the time the trial was closed. Only the follow-up was discontinued early, but not the treatment. It is noteworthy that given the small sample size, this trial is hypothesis-generating and is able to detect only a large benefit of combination therapy with rituximab and ABT-263. It does not have adequate power to detect minimal clinically meaningful differences between the combination treatment arms and arm A. ',\n"," 'Thus, formal hypothesis testing is limited in that statistically negative outcomes do not necessarily rule out clinically significant effects. Ninety-one patients (77%) completed the navitoclax study; four patients crossed over to arm B from arm A. The median time on study was 34 weeks; arm A: 24 weeks (range 12-83 weeks); arm B: 33 weeks (1-105 weeks); and arm C: 44 weeks (2-86 weeks). More patients withdrew from study due to AEs in arm C (8 [20%]) than in arm A (0 [0%]) or arm B (4 [11%]). Patients in arm C, who were randomized to continue daily navitoclax after completing six cycles of rituximab, had a longer time on study (median of 44 weeks) than patients in either arm B (33 weeks) or arm A (24 weeks), because this study arm stayed open longer than the other two study arms to allow for continued administration of navitoclax. The percentages of patients who experienced grade >= 3 AEs was greater in arms B and C than in arm A. Grade >= 3 AEs (with an incidence of 5% or greater, Table II) included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain), chills, fatigue, ALT/AST/bilirubin elevations and infusion-related reactions to rituximab. Two patients had grade 5 AEs, one each (3%) in arms A and B, neither of which was assessed by the investigator as being related to treatment with navitoclax. The incidence of SAEs was not increased in patients treated with navitoclax compared to patients treated with rituximab alone. One patient had grade 3 bleeding (epistaxis). A total of 12 patients discontinued navitoclax due to an AE, four (11%) in arm B and eight (20%) in arm C. AEs leading to discontinuation of therapy with navitoclax included elevations in AST and/or ALT (six patients), pain (n = 1), hyperbilirubinemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 1), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), serum sickness (n = 1) or reaction to the infusion of rituximab (n = 1). While liver function test (LFT) abnormalities usually responded to dose adjustments, of the six patients who discontinued navitoclax, four patients in arm B discontinued at study days 37, 43, 56 and 58, while two patients on arm C discontinued at day 170 and day 316, respectively. Most of the LFT-associated discontinuations (four of the six) occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. ',\n"," 'Other reasons for discontinuation of therapy were less common: physician decision (n = 5 [4%]), sponsor decision (n = 2 [2%]) and subject/guardian decision (n = 6 [5%]). Grade >= 3 infusion-related reactions were uncommon, but more often were observed in patients treated in arm B (n = 3 [8%]) or C (n = 2 [5%]), one of which was an SAE; no patient in arm A had such an AE. Two patients died while on study, one in arm A, who died on day 163 with a pulmonary embolism, judged by the treating physician as being unrelated to rituximab treatment. One patient in arm B died on day 8 due to hypotension, which was viewed by the site investigator as being related to the infusion of rituximab. Plasma concentrations of navitoclax are shown in Table III. The maximum navitoclax concentrations (Cmax) were observed approximately 6 h after oral administration. The Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of navitoclax in this study were similar to those observed in patients treated with single-agent navitoclax in prior phase 1 studies, indicating that co-treatment with rituximab does not alter the PK of navitoclax. Patients treated in arm A had serum concentrations of rituximab that were comparable to those measured in patients treated in arm B or arm C, indicating that navitoclax does not affect the PK of rituximab. Rituximab levels were consistent across the three arms at other sampling visits from week 2 to week 24 as well (Supplemental Table I, Supplemental Figure 1 to be found online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2015.1030638). The rituximab concentration levels achieved in this study using weekly dosing were higher than those observed in patients with CLL treated with rituximab given once every 28 days. Achievement of clinical response correlated significantly with BCL2 levels (interaction effect p = 0.048), but did not correlate with levels of other BCL2 family members tested. Patients with CLL cells that had high-level expression of BCL2 protein had significantly higher odds of achieving a favorable clinical response when treated with navitoclax and rituximab, than when treated with rituximab alone (Table IV). In comparison, patients with low BCL2 had similar odds of achieving a favorable response when treated with navitoclax and rituximab as when treated with rituximab alone. ',\n"," 'The data on patients treated with navitoclax in arms B and C were combined for this analysis and compared to the data on patients treated with rituximab alone (arm A). This was done to help identify biomarkers that correlated with a favorable outcome to treatment with navitoclax and rituximab versus treatment with rituximab alone. Similar effects were also observed when comparing arms A vs. B and also arms A vs. C (data not shown). The ORR for patients treated in arm C was 70% (Table V). This compared favorably to the ORR of patients treated in arm B (55%) and was significantly greater than the ORR of patients treated in arm A (35%; p = 0034). Two patients in arm C (5%) achieved a complete response (n = 2, 5%), which was not observed for patients in other treatment arms. Twenty-seven PFS events had occurred at the time of study closure (38% of 72 events planned). These events included one patient who died (arm A), 24 patients who had stable disease or objective response (11 patients in arm A, 10 in arm B and three in arm C) and two patients (arm A) who had stable disease or objective response but subsequently went on to have progressive disease. PFS was significantly longer for arm C than for arm B or arm A (Figure 2). Arm B trended toward longer PFS than arm A. Response duration and median PFS cannot be quantified precisely due to the limited follow-up and patient numbers. Four patients crossed over from arm A to arm B. No exploratory analyses of efficacy data were performed on the cross-over period for these four patients. However, one patient had a partial response while on arm A while three patients had stable disease while on arm A and subsequently had progressive disease. Patients treated with navitoclax in combination with rituximab achieved higher ORR than patients treated with rituximab alone as initial therapy for CLL. The improved treatment outcome with navitoclax was also evident for patients who had CLL with del(17p). Similarly, improvement in treatment outcomes with navitoclax was seen in patients with CLL with other prognostic features such as del(11q) or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IgVH) (data not shown). Disease progression after therapy was observed earliest in patients treated with rituximab alone (arm A). Patients in arm C appeared to have the longest PFS. ',\n"," 'Treatment with navitoclax and rituximab was well tolerated. First, we did not observe any interactions between navitoclax and rituximab that altered the PK of either drug. Second, there were few grade >= 3 AEs that were observed more frequently in patients treated with both agents than in those treated with rituximab alone. Those AEs noted more frequently by patients treated with navitoclax included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and elevations in hepatic transaminases. Navitoclax-related thrombocytopenia is caused by shortened platelet survival due to inhibition of BCLXL, a protein necessary for normal platelet survival. This was managed by initiating therapy with a lead-in dose of 100 mg navitoclax 1 week before advancing to the 250 mg daily dose, to allow time for the marrow to increase platelet production and provide a steady-state platelet count sufficient for hemostasis. Thereafter, platelet counts were closely monitored and treatment was temporarily held or given at a reduced dose if the counts dropped. Patients also were cautioned not to use aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs while on treatment. This management appears to have mitigated risk, as the only report of bleeding among the navitoclax-treated patients was a single AE of self-limited epistaxis. Neutropenia, another mechanistic-based effect of navitoclax, was managed with dose reductions, temporary discontinuation and administration of granulocyte stimulating factor. There was no increase in infections or febrile neutropenia compared with treatment with rituximab alone. These on-target AEs and the liver function abnormalities were manageable in most cases with dose adjustments, use of granulocyte stimulating growth factor or temporary discontinuation. Nonetheless, cytopenias (one each of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) and transaminase elevations (six patients) led to the discontinuation of navitoclax in a minority of patients. Two additional patients discontinued navitoclax due to hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic transaminase elevations, respectively. Earlier studies hypothesized that the high expression of BCL2 and BIM and their association in pre-existing complexes in CLL cells would make these cells particularly sensitive to navitoclax. We found BCL2 to be well expressed in patients on this study. We further tested whether quantitative levels of BCL2, BIM and related family members would be associated with improved responses to the combination of navitoclax and rituximab. Patients with CLL cells that expressed high levels of BCL2 (above the median) appeared to have had a more favorable response to therapy with navitoclax and rituximab than with rituximab alone. ',\n"," \"These data suggest that the benefit from the addition of navitoclax to rituximab is associated with high-level CLL-cell expression of BCL2 protein. It further supports the use of baseline BCL2 protein expression as a predictive biomarker of response to navitoclax. A similar relationship was not identified for the pretreatment levels of BCLXL or MCL1, making it appear sufficient to use a more selective BCL2 antagonist. In contrast to the findings here, no significant correlation between level of expression of BCL2 and response was observed in the phase 1 study of navitoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL. This could be explained by potential biological differences between the relapsed/refractory and frontline patient population. It is also worth noting that the use of a standardized assay that was run real-time in a central laboratory on fresh patient samples may have improved quantification of protein biomarkers in the present study. However, the magnitude of the benefit from navitoclax treatment versus rituximab alone in patients with high BCL2 protein levels would need to be confirmed prospectively. The caveat to the results is the small sample size in this study, and that the analysis is exploratory. To compensate for the limited availability of data, arms B and C were pooled for the biomarker analysis where time/duration was different in arms B and C, but was not a parameter that influenced bio-marker data outcome. It must be noted that data for arms B and C were not pooled when analyzing PFS, for the PFS out-come is dependent on time/duration, which were different in the three arms. Patients treated with navitoclax and rituximab in either arm C or arm B had a significantly higher response rate than did patients treated with rituximab alone on arm A. Patients treated in arm C, who continued treatment with navitoclax, appeared to have a longer PFS than patients treated in the other study arms. Although these differences were statistically significant, caution should be exercised in interpreting these data in view of the limited follow-up period due to the study's premature discontinuation. In any case, the results of this study indicate that a high-affinity BCL2 inhibitor combined with rituximab can potentially result in high ORRs in the frontline therapy of patients with CLL, and that a combination with monoclonal antibodies may further increase the response rate. \",\n"," 'Of note, the observed response rate of patients with del(17p) was similar to that of patients without this adverse prognostic marker; in arm C, 60% of patients with del(17p) CLL had either a complete or partial response, while in the ITT population 70% of patients showed an overall response. Overall, the regimen of navitoclax and rituximab was well tolerated, with the principal toxicities being dose-related thrombocytopenia, presumably due to inhibition of BCLXL, and transient elevations in hepatic transaminases. Preliminary results indicate that a BH3-mimetic inhibitor of BCL2 could be highly effective when used in combination with rituximab for treatment of patients with CLL. Although the combination of ABT-263 and rituximab was deemed tolerable and offered a high response rate, the thrombocytopenia caused by BCLXL inhibition limited increases to optimize drug levels and complicated combinations with other drugs. At the same time, a highly selective BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, had been developed with very high affinity for BCL2 and effectively no BCLXL inhibition. This study provided additional data supporting the concept of BCL2 inhibition as an effective treatment approach for CLL and demonstrated that an increased response may be possible with a monoclonal antibody combination. ',\n"," 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily affects older persons who often have coexisting conditions in addition to disease-related immunosuppression and myelosuppression. We conducted an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial to compare two oral agents, ibrutinib and chlorambucil, in previously untreated older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. We randomly assigned 269 previously untreated patients who were 65 years of age or older and had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive ibrutinib or chlorambucil. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review committee. The median age of the patients was 73 years. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than did chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months), with a risk of progression or death that was 84% lower with ibrutinib than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; P<0.001). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival; the estimated survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death that was 84% lower in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (hazard ratio, 0.16; P=0.001). The overall response rate was higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%, P<0.001). The rates of sustained increases from baseline values in the hemoglobin and platelet levels were higher with ibrutinib. Adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea; adverse events occurring in at least 20% of those receiving chlorambucil included nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting. In the ibrutinib group, four patients had a grade 3 hemorrhage and one had a grade 4 hemorrhage. A total of 87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group are continuing to take ibrutinib. Ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as assessed by progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; RESONATE-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01722487.) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia among adults in Western countries; it affects primarily older persons, with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years. Chlorambucil has been a standard first-line therapy in CLL, especially for older patients or those with coexisting conditions. Until recently, no treatment was clearly superior to chlorambucil in this population. ',\n"," \"Fludarabine or bendamustine has been associated with higher response rates and longer progression-free survival than those with chlorambucil, but both have also been associated with higher rates of toxic effects, and neither has provided overall survival benefit. In previously untreated patients who were younger than 75 years of age, bendamustine was associated with longer progression-free survival as compared with chlorambucil (median, 21.6 months vs. 8.3 months). Only recently have data from randomized studies shown improved outcomes with the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies to chlorambucil. In the three-group randomized CLL11 study conducted by the German CLL Study Group, which involved previously untreated patients with coexisting conditions, the median progression-free survival was 29.9 months with the combination of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil, 16.3 months with the combination of rituximab and chlorambucil, and 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; overall survival was longer with the combination regimens than with chlorambucil. In another phase 3 study, which involved previously untreated patients who were not considered to be candidates for fludarabine-containing therapy, the median progression-free survival was 13.1 months with chlorambucil versus 22.4 months with the combination of chlorambucil and ofatumumab. Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is standard in younger patients with CLL, but because of treatment-related toxic effects, this regimen is not suitable for older patients or those with coexisting conditions. Patients who are 65 years of age or older do not have the same efficacy benefit, and they have more toxic effects than do younger patients treated with this combination chemoimmunotherapy. Moreover, although the median progression-free survival with first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is approximately 52 months, patients with high-risk genetic abnormalities (chromosome 17p13.1 or 11q22.3 deletion) or unmutated IGHV have inferior outcomes, with approximately 35 to 50% of the patients having progressive disease within 3 years. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that has been approved for the treatment of patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy and as primary therapy for patients with CLL who have chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. BTK is essential for signaling by means of the B-cell receptor and chemokine receptors, which CLL cells use for survival, proliferation, and tissue homing. In pharmacodynamic studies of ibrutinib in vivo in patients with CLL, ibrutinib inhibited leukemia-cell proliferation and accelerated CLL cell death. \",\n"," 'for signaling by means of the B-cell receptor and chemokine receptors, which CLL cells use for survival, proliferation, and tissue homing. In pharmacodynamic studies of ibrutinib in vivo in patients with CLL, ibrutinib inhibited leukemia-cell proliferation and accelerated CLL cell death. In the phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib versus Ofatumumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE) involving patients with previously treated CLL, single-agent ibrutinib showed superior efficacy to ofatumumab, with a risk of progression that was 78% lower and a risk of death that was 57% lower. In early-phase data from 31 previously untreated patients with CLL who were 65 years of age or older, the overall response rate with ibrutinib was 84% (with a complete response in 23% of the patients); the estimated rate of progression-free survival at 30 months was 96%, and the overall survival rate was 97%, with 81% of the patients continuing to take daily ibrutinib after 3 years of follow-up. These findings suggest a role for single-agent ibrutinib as initial treatment in patients with CLL. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial (RESONATE-2; study number, PCYC-1115-CA) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil in patients 65 years of age or older with previously untreated CLL. Eligible patients were 65 years of age or older and had previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma requiring therapy. Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 2 or less (on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher numbers indicating increasing disability), an absolute neutrophil count of 1000 cells or more per cubic millimeter, a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter, and adequate liver and kidney function. Patients were ineligible if they had chromosome 17p13.1 deletion. All the patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each institution and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was sponsored and designed by Pharmacyclics. All the investigators and their research teams collected the data. The sponsor confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled the data for analysis. All the authors had full access to the data and were involved in the interpretation of the data. ',\n"," \"The first draft of the manuscript was collaboratively written by the first and last authors and two authors who are employees of the sponsor. Editorial support was provided by a professional medical writer, with funding from the sponsor. All the authors contributed to the revisions and final approval of the manuscript and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and analyses and confirm adherence of the trial to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). An independent review committee whose members were unaware of the treatment assignments and lymphocyte counts evaluated response and progression. Patients were enrolled in the United States, countries in Europe, and other countries (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either oral ibrutinib (at a dose of 420 mg once daily) until disease progression or development of an unacceptable level of toxic effects or up to 12 cycles of chlorambucil (at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle, which was increased to a maximum of 0.8 mg per kilogram, if there was not an unacceptable level of toxic effects) until disease progression, determination of a lack of efficacy (defined as a lack of complete or partial response, as determined by the investigator), or development of an unacceptable level of toxic effects. Patients with disease progression that was confirmed by the independent review committee were enrolled in a separate extension study (PCYC-1116-CA) for follow-up and second-line treatment according to the investigator's choice. Treatment in the PCYC-1116-CA study could include ibrutinib for chlorambucil-treated patients who had disease that progressed according to the independent review committee and who had an indication for treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) as determined by the investigator. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the independent review committee according to the iwCLL criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis such that isolated treatment-related lymphocytosis (in the absence of other clinical, computed tomographic, or laboratory evidence of disease progression) was not considered to indicate progressive disease. \",\n"," 'Key secondary end points included overall survival, overall response (details in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), the rate of sustained improvement in hematologic variables, and safety. Sustained hematologic improvement was defined as an increase in hematologic variables that was sustained continuously for at least 56 days without transfusion or growth factors, as measured by the following: an increase in the platelet count or absolute neutrophil count from baseline of at least 50%, or for hemoglobin, an increase from baseline of >=2 g per deciliter; or for patients with baseline cytopenia, an increase to a hemoglobin level of more than 11 g per deciliter, a platelet count of more than 100,000 per cubic millimeter, or an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1500 per cubic millimeter. Safety assessments included evaluation of adverse events and measurement of laboratory variables. The severity of nonhematologic adverse events was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Hematologic adverse events were graded according to the iwCLL criteria. Patients were monitored every 2 weeks during cycles 1 and 2, every 4 weeks during cycles 3 through 12, and then every 8 weeks starting at cycle 13. The assessment of response was conducted every 4 cycles until disease progression or until study closure. The study was powered on the basis of the primary end point, progression-free survival. We calculated that the occurrence of 81 events of death or disease progression would provide the study with approximately 85% power to detect a hazard ratio for progression or death of 0.50 with ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil, with the use of a one-sided log-rank test at an alpha level of 0.025. No interim analysis was planned. The type I error was controlled with the use of a hierarchical closed-testing procedure for the primary end point and ordered secondary end points including, in order, overall response rate, overall survival, and sustained hematologic improvement. The primary analysis was a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to two randomization factors: ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. 2) and disease stage (Rai stage <=II vs. III or IV). The overall response rate was analyzed by means of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, stratified according to the two randomization factors. Overall survival was analyzed with the use of an unstratified log-rank test, owing to small event numbers. ',\n"," \"The rate of sustained hematologic improvement was compared by a chi-square test for treatment effect. Beginning in March 2013, a total of 269 patients underwent randomization (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The characteristics of the patients at baseline were well balanced between the two groups (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 73 years, with 70% of the patients being 70 years of age or older; 45% of the patients had advanced-stage disease (Rai stage III or IV), and 20% had chromosome 11q22.3 deletion. The median follow-up was 18.4 months, with 87% of the patients who had been randomly assigned to ibrutinib still receiving treatment at the time of analysis. In the chlorambucil group, 40% of the patients completed the maximum of 12 cycles of treatment (mean dose per administration, 0.6 mg per kilogram; range, 0.3 to 0.8). Ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than that with chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months) as assessed by the independent review committee, with a relative risk of progression or death that was 84% lower than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.28; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). The rate of progression-free survival at 18 months was 90% in the ibrutinib group versus 52% in the chlorambucil group. The results of the analysis of progression-free survival were consistent in the higher-risk subgroups, including patients with Rai stage III or IV disease, worse ECOG performance-status score, presence of chromosome 11q22.3 deletion, and unmutated IGHV status (Fig. 1C). The rate of progression-free survival at 18 months with ibrutinib was approximately 89% both in the subgroup with unmutated IGHV and in the subgroup with mutated IGHV; the corresponding rates of progression-free survival with chlorambucil were 47% and 51%. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival, a key sensitivity analysis, also showed significant prolongation of progression-free survival with ibrutinib (median, not reached vs. 15.0 months), with a relative risk of progression or death that was 91% lower than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.17; P<0.001) (Fig. 1B). The only case of Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into an aggressive, rapidly growing large-cell lymphoma) occurred in the chlorambucil group. Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival (median, not reached in either group). \",\n"," 'The overall survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death with ibrutinib that was 84% lower than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56; P = 0.001) (Fig. 2A). Over the median follow-up of 18.4 months, 3 patients in the ibrutinib group died, as compared with 17 in the chlorambucil group. The 3 patients in the ibrutinib group who died included 1 who died from a klebsiella infection and 2 who died from unknown causes (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the 17 patients in the chlorambucil group who died, the most common causes were progressive disease and infection. None of the patients in the ibrutinib group who had disease that progressed died during follow-up. The response rate as assessed by the independent review committee was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (86% vs. 35%) (Fig. 2B); 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Details regarding the frequency and duration of lymphocytosis with ibrutinib are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. Complete responses (including those in patients with incomplete blood-count recovery) occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group and in 2% of those in the chlorambucil group (Fig. 2B). The rates of sustained improvement in hemato-logic variables were significantly higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix). Among patients with anemia at baseline, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group had sustained improvement in the hemoglobin level (84% vs. 45%, P<0.001) (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, among patients who had thrombocytopenia at baseline, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group had sustained improvement in the platelet count (77% vs. 43%, P = 0.005). Changes in hematologic variables over time are shown in Figure 3. The most common adverse events, defined as those that occurred in 15% or more of the patients in either treatment group, are shown in Table 2 and in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix. ',\n"," 'The median period of exposure to the study treatment was 17.4 months (range, 0.7 to 24.7) in the ibrutinib group versus 7.1 months (range, 0.5 to 11.7) in the chlorambucil group, hence the corresponding collection period for adverse-event data was longer in the ibrutinib group. In the ibrutinib group, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event (in 42% of the patients, including grade 3 diarrhea in 4%) (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Other adverse events that occurred in 20% or more of the patients in the ibrutinib group were fatigue, nausea, and cough. In the chlorambucil group, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting were observed in 20% or more of the patients; all these events occurred at a higher frequency in the chlorambucil group than in the ibrutinib group (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Discontinuation of treatment owing to adverse events occurred less frequently in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (in 9% vs. 23% of the patients). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events are listed in Table 2. Hypertension was observed in 14% of the patients in the ibrutinib group, with grade 3 hypertension occurring in 4% and no events of grade 4 or 5. All six patients with grade 3 hypertension were treated with antihypertensive medication and did not require a dose reduction or discontinuation of ibrutinib. Four of these patients had a history of hypertension; blood-pressure values over time in these patients are shown in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Atrial fibrillation occurred in eight patients (6%) in the ibrutinib group, which was of grade 2 in six patients and grade 3 in two. Atrial fibrillation was managed with discontinuation of the study drug in two patients (1%) and without modification of the ibrutinib dose in the remaining six patients. Seven of these eight patients had a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or myocardial ischemia. One patient in the chlorambucil group had atrial fibrillation. During a median of 17.4 months of exposure to ibrutinib, major hemorrhage (defined as any serious or grade 3 or higher hemorrhage or central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade) occurred in 4% of the patients in the ibrutinib group (six patients, with one having grade 2 hemorrhage, four having grade 3, and one having grade 4) (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). ',\n"," 'Hemorrhage led to the discontinuation of treatment in three of these patients; three of the six patients were receiving concomitant low-molecular-weight heparin, aspirin, or vitamin E at the time of the event. Major hemorrhage in the central nervous system included one grade 4 intraparenchymal hemorrhage related to transformation of an ischemic stroke in a patient with diabetes and hypertension and one grade 3 post-traumatic subdural hematoma. Major hemorrhage occurred in 2% of the patients in the chlorambucil group over the 7.1-month period of exposure. In this randomized study involving older patients with previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil with respect to progression-free and overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables. The relative risk of progression was 84% lower and the relative risk of death was also 84% lower with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil. Ibrutinib toxicity was modest in the majority of patients, with 87% of the patients continuing to take the single-agent therapy at a median follow-up of 18.4 months. All current standards for first-line CLL therapy are based on cytotoxic chemotherapy, including alkylating agents, purine analogues, or combinations thereof, except for patients with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, for whom ibrutinib is a primary consideration for first-line therapy according to consensus guidelines. In addition to their myelosuppressive effects, these cytotoxic chemotherapy approaches may be associated with expansion of subclones with high-risk genetic abnormalities (e.g., TP53 or NOTCH1 mutation) and an increased risk of secondary cancers, including treatment-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. When this study was initiated, single-agent chlorambucil was considered to be a standard first-line treatment in older patients with CLL. Phase 3 studies have only recently shown improvement in outcomes when chlorambucil is coadministered with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Depending on the anti-CD20 agent used in these combinations, the median progression-free survival has been reported as 16.3 months (with rituximab and chlorambucil), 22.4 months (with ofatumumab and chlorambucil), and 29.9 months (with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil). The addition of an anti-CD20 agent that requires a slow infusion has been associated with infusion reactions of grade 3 or higher (in 4 to 20% of patients) and with higher rates of neutropenia of grade 3 or higher (in 27 to 35%) than have been observed with chlorambucil alone. ',\n"," 'Similar to results observed in patients with relapsed disease, the finding of a positive effect of ibrutinib on progression-free survival in the current study was seen in high-risk subgroups, including patients with Rai stage III or IV disease, those with chromosome 11q22.3 deletion, and those with unmutated IGHV. At 18 months, the rate of progression-free survival with ibrutinib as assessed by the independent review committee was 90%, and the rate as assessed by the investigator was 94%; the median progression-free survival with ibrutinib could not be estimated owing to the small number of progression events. The median progression-free survival of 18.9 months with chlorambucil that was observed in this study appears to be generally longer than that reported in previous trials with chlorambucil in previously untreated patients, in which the median progression-free survival ranged from 8.3 to 20.0 months. The relatively strong performance of chlorambucil in the current study may have been influenced, in part, by a generally longer exposure to chlorambucil than was used in earlier trials involving previously untreated patients with CLL or by the exclusion of patients with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion (typically 5 to 10% of previously untreated patients with CLL). Ibrutinib substantially improved overall survival, with an overall survival rate of 98% at 24 months, a finding that is consistent with the 97% rate reported in a phase 2 study of ibrutinib with 3 years of follow-up. In these two studies, deaths (3 deaths among 136 patients and 1 death among 31 patients, respectively) were limited to the early part of follow-up with a relative plateau in the survival curve thereafter. The magnitude of the difference in overall survival with ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil (hazard ratio for death, 0.16) was greater than that observed in studies assessing the addition of anti-CD20 agents to chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.47 in one study and 0.91 in another study). Given the availability of crossover for patients who had disease that progressed during chlorambucil treatment, the prolongation of overall survival, which was a major benefit in this study, suggests that patients have benefits with first-line ibrutinib treatment possibly owing to reduced CLL-related or treatment-related mortality before the initiation of second-line therapy. These findings suggest that better results with ibrutinib might be obtained when it is used as first-line treatment rather than for later relapses or in patients with refractory disease. ',\n"," 'The response rate was significantly higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%). On the basis of results from an early-phase study, the rate of complete response is likely to increase with continued ibrutinib therapy. Furthermore, ibrutinib-treated patients had a restoration of bone marrow function, with a significantly higher rate of sustained improvement in hematologic variables. This finding has particular clinical relevance because bone marrow failure is a common cause of complications in patients with CLL, with anemia and thrombocytopenia being frequent indications for initiating treatment in this population. The safety of ibrutinib in this older population of patients with CLL who often had clinically significant coexisting conditions (Table 1) was consistent with that in previous reports. Exposure to treatment and adverse-event follow-up was nearly 2.5 times as long with ibrutinib as with chlorambucil. Similar to findings in previous reports about ibrutinib, major hemorrhage was observed in 4% of the patients, with no fatal events, and atrial fibrillation occurred in 6%, with the majority of the events (in six of eight patients) being grade 2 events that were observed over the period of 1.5 years while the patients were taking ibrutinib. Hypertension was reported more frequently with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil, with no events leading to dose modification or having a severity of grade 4 or 5. The rates of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression were higher with chlorambucil than with ibrutinib. Early discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events was more than twice as frequent with chlorambucil as with ibrutinib. In conclusion, in this older population of patients with CLL, many of whom had coexisting conditions, oral ibrutinib was administered continuously with a safety profile consistent with that in prior reports, which permitted the vast majority of patients to continue taking the treatment at the completion of the study. As compared with chlorambucil, a standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, ibrutinib was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival and with higher rates of response and improvement in hematologic variables among patients with previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

SUMMARY  AIM  The Phase Ib GERSHWIN study (NCT01680991) assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile obinutuzumab following multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses to Chinese patients with B-cell lymphomas,  and compared findings with previous obinutuzumab PK studies in mainly Caucasian (non-Chinese)  patients. METHODS  GERSHWIN was an open-label, single-arm intervention study. Patients aged >18 years with CD20+  relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or  follicular lymphoma (FL) were enrolled from four centres in China. The treatment period was 24  weeks; patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg i.v. on Days (D)1, 8 and 15 of Cycle (C)1 (CLL  patients: first infusion split over 2 days) and on D1 of C2–8 (all cycles: 21 days). PK parameters were  estimated using non-compartmental analysis (NCA), and a population PK analysis was used to  determine whether observed GERSHWIN PK data were in accordance with previous obinutuzumab PK studies in non-Chinese patients. RESULTS  The PK analysis population included 48 patients: 28 patients completed all treatment cycles. NCA  showed a similar PK profile in Chinese patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. ',\n"," 'Steady-state concentrations  of obinutuzumab appeared to be reached at the start of C2 irrespective of histology. There was no  apparent relationship between body weight and systemic exposure. Most PK profiles observed in  GERSHWIN lay within the 90% prediction interval of simulated profiles. CONCLUSIONS  Obinutuzumab exposure was comparable in CLL, DLBCL and FL patients.

Introduction  B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that range from slow- growing indolent and incurable diseases, such as follicular lymphoma (FL) or chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia (CLL), to more aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). In China, there are few  epidemiological data for lymphoma. According to a nationwide collaborative study of 10 002  lymphoma cases diagnosed in 2010, DLBCL is the most common B-cell lymphoma subtype in China,  accounting for 50.2% of all cases, compared with 8.3% for FL and 6.4% for CLL/small lymphocytic  lymphoma [1]. The relatively low incidence of CLL among the Chinese population was also  highlighted in a North American survey, which reported a world age-standardised rate (per 100 000)  for CLL of 0.40 among the Chinese population in British Columbia compared with 1.71 among the  non-Chinese population [2]. Despite the availability of various agents for the treatment of non-Hodgkin  lymphoma (NHL) and CLL, there is an on-going need for the development of safe and effective  therapies to prolong remission in patients and to improve cure rates. Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA/GAZYVARO) is a novel glycoengineered type II monoclonal  antibody (mAb). ',\n"," 'high-affinity binding to the CD20  antigen, and high antibody-dependent cellular toxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and  cell death induction, combined with low complement-dependent cytotoxic activity [3, 4].

All rights reserved. approval has recently been granted in Europe, the USA and other countries worldwide for use of  obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil to treat previously untreated patients with CLL [5, 6]. The basis for this approval was data from the Phase III CLL11 study showing a statistically significant  improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil compared with  rituximab plus chlorambucil in treatment-naïve CLL patients (n = 781) with comorbidities (median PFS  29.2 vs. 15.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33, 0.50; P < 0.001) [7,  8]. Obinutuzumab also demonstrated promising activity in patients with rituximab-refractory CLL and  NHL in the single-arm Phase II GAUGUIN study [9, 10] and a higher overall response rate compared  with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent lymphoma in the Phase II GAUSS study [11]. Subsequently, the Phase III GADOLIN study in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL  showed that independently-assessed PFS was longer after treatment with obinutuzumab plus  bendamustine than after bendamustine alone (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.4, 0.74; P = 0.00011) [12]. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of obinutuzumab are well described by a two-compartment model comprising linear and non-linear time-varying clearance pathways [13]. date, several  studies have examined the PK of obinutuzumab in patients with NHL and CLL, for example the Phase  II GAUGUIN study (NCT00517530 [9, 10]) in Caucasian patients [9, 10, 14–16], and a Phase I  Japanese study [17]. Other studies assessing obinutuzumab PK include CLL11 (NCT01010061 [7]),  GAUDI (NCT00825149; Grigg A, et al., Haematologica, under consideration) [18, 19], GAUSS  (NCT00576758 [11]), GATHER (NCT01414855) and GADOLIN (NCT01059630 [20]). However, bridging studies are a frequent requirement of Asian drug regulatory authorities when considering a  new therapeutic entity [21]. The primary purpose of the current study (GERSHWIN; NCT01680991)  was to assess the PK profile of obinutuzumab following administration of multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses to Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B-cell lymphomas and to compare the findings with  those from other obinutuzumab PK studies in mainly Caucasian (non-Chinese) patients using a  population PK approach.

All rights reserved. four centres in China from 6 September 2012 to 15 August 2013. GERSHWIN was conducted accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. This study  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of  Medical Sciences, in May 2012 (12–047/581). All patients provided written informed consent to  participate in the study. The treatment period was 24 weeks; patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg i.v. on Days 1,  8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 8 (each cycle lasted 21 days). The first infusion of  obinutuzumab on Cycle 1 Day 1 was given as a split dose over 2 days in CLL patients. For the first  infusion, obinutuzumab was administered at an initial rate of 50 mg/h in patients with NHL. In the  absence of infusion-related reactions, the infusion rate was increased by 50 mg/h every 30 min to a  maximum of 400 mg/h. In CLL patients, the first two infusions were given at a dose of 100 mg at a  rate of 25 mg/h over 4 h on Day 1 and at a dose of 900 mg starting at 50 mg/h on Day 2, increasing  by 50 mg/h every 30 min to a maximum of 400 mg/h. If the first obinutuzumab infusion was well  tolerated by the patient (CLL or NHL), subsequent infusions were given at an initial rate of 100 mg/h  and increased by 100 mg/h increments at 30-min intervals (as tolerated) to a maximum rate of 400  mg/h. Obinutuzumab aqueous solution was supplied in a 50 ml glass vial containing 1000 mg of  drug in 40 ml of solution (25 mg/ml), together with the excipients histidine, trehalose and  poloxamer 188. Before infusion, obinutuzumab was diluted by adding 40 ml of solution to 210 ml of  0.9% sodium chloride solution in an infusion bag, to produce a final concentration for infusion of  4 mg/ml. ',\n"," 'Study population  Patients were aged >18 years with histologically documented CD20+ relapsed/refractory CLL, DLBCL  or FL, an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and a life  expectancy of >6 months. Patients with FL or DLBCL could be included if they had failed (relapsing  after, or refractory to) ≥1 chemotherapy regimen with or without rituximab at any point in their  treatment history.

Refractory was defined as progression on treatment or stable disease (SD), or any response that was  followed by progression <6 months after treatment. With the exception of CLL patients, all patients must have had ≥1 bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (>1.5 cm in its largest dimension by computed tomography). For CLL patients,  circulating lymphocyte count assessments were an acceptable method of measurement. All  measurable and evaluable disease was required to be assessed and documented before study  treatment initiation. Tumour response was assessed according to the International Workshop to  Standardize Response criteria for NHL [22], and the 2008 guidelines of the International Workshop on  CLL [23]. Full inclusion criteria and details of patient exclusion criteria can be found in Appendix I. Study endpoints and procedures  Blood samples for the measurement of obinutuzumab serum concentrations (5 ml pre-dose Cycle 1 Day 1; 2 ml for all other samples) were collected as follows. For NHL patients, Day 1 samples  were collected pre-dose, at the end of infusion, and at 4, 24, 72 and 120 h post-infusion. For CLL  patients, Day 1 and Day 2 samples were collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion, and also at 4,  24, 72 and 120 h post-infusion on Day 2. The additional sampling for CLL patients reflected the split  dosing of obinutuzumab over Days 1 and 2 in this group. ',\n"," 'Additional blood samples (all patients) were  collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion for all subsequent doses, and at 4, 24, 72, 120, 168,  336, 504 and 672 h and 3 and 6 months after the final infusion (Cycle 8 Day 1). Obinutuzumab serum concentrations were measured using a specific and validated enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Samples were pre-incubated with a cocktail containing  biotinylated and digoxigenin-labelled anti-idiotype antibodies directed to the antigen binding site of  obinutuzumab. Using a streptavidin-coated microplate, immune complexes bound to the microplate  were detected by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Fab fragments directed digoxigenin. Bound peroxidase was detected through a chromogenic reaction. The absorbance (405 nm for detection absorbance and 490 nm for reference absorbance) was proportional to the  amount of obinutuzumab present in the sample.

The lower limit  of quantification in undiluted serum was 0.00405 μg/ml. The calibration range concentrations were  0.00405 to 0.400 μg/ml in 100% human serum. The accuracy of the ELISA method (using quality  control samples) for determination of obinutuzumab serum sample concentrations was consistent  throughout the study: precision ranged from 4.43% to 25.2% and accuracy ranged from 95.1% to  100.0%. Pharmacokinetic analyses  The PK analysis population included all patients randomised and adherent to the study protocol. Pharmacokinetic analyses using non-compartmental analysis (NCA)  PK parameters of obinutuzumab for each patient were estimated using NCA (Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.2; Certara USA, Inc.). Time to maximum observed serum concentration (tmax), maximum  observed serum concentration (Cmax), and trough concentration before the next dose (Ctrough) were  obtained directly from plasma vs. time profiles. The following PK parameters were calculated:  apparent terminal half-life (t1/2), area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to Day 7  (AUC7d), area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to Day 21 (AUC21d) at Cycle 8,  systemic clearance (CLss), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss). All computed PK parameters were presented as summary statistics, including arithmetic means, geometric means (e.g. AUC and Cmax), medians, ranges, standard deviations and coefficients  of variation (CV%). Individual and mean serum concentrations of obinutuzumab vs. time were  graphically displayed. ',\n"," 'Population pharmacokinetic analysis  To determine if observed obinutuzumab PK data from GERSHWIN (available for 48 Chinese patients)  were in accordance with obinutuzumab PK data from previous clinical studies, a robust population PK  model previously developed in a large database of 961 lymphoma patients (mainly Caucasian [95%]:  342 CLL; 469 indolent NHL [406 FL]; 130 DLBCL; 20 mantle cell lymphoma]) was used to simulate  PK profiles in the GERSHWIN study (unpublished data on file, F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Clinical  Pharmacology, Basel, Switzerland). Simulations were conducted by taking into account patients’  baseline characteristics (e.g. tumour size, body weight, gender) in the current study, and were run 100  This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. times to determine the median, 5 and 95 predicted PK profile. The adequacy of matching between  observed obinutuzumab concentrations in GERSHWIN and predicted PK profiles was assessed graphically by overlaying the observed PK data with the predicted mean profile and its associated  90% prediction interval. Full details of the population PK model have been published previously by  Gibiansky et al. [13]. Results  Patients  Of 56 Chinese patients screened, 48 patients (FL, n = 13; DLBCL, n = 23; CLL, n = 12) were enrolled  and 28 patients (58.3%) completed treatment. Seventeen patients discontinued obinutuzumab during  Cycles 1–4 and three patients discontinued obinutuzumab during Cycles 5–8. Reasons for  discontinuation of obinutuzumab included progressive disease (n = 9), physician decision (n = 6),  withdrawal by patient (n = 3), adverse event (pneumonia) and protocol violation (n = 1 each). A total  of 141 adverse events were reported by 35 patients, most of which were of mild or moderate severity  (116; 82.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events were infusion-related reactions (15  patients; 31.2%), all of which occurred after the first obinutuzumab infusion. full report of safety  results from the study will be published separately. The PK analysis population included 48 patients: 28 patients (FL, n = 11; DLBCL, n = 8; CLL,  n = 9) completed the 8-cycle PK sample collection. ',\n"," 'Three patients (DLBCL, n = 2; CLL, n = 1) were  excluded from the Cycle 1 PK analysis due to limited PK sampling and an additional two patients  (DLBCL, n = 2) were excluded from the analysis of t1/2 and Vss at Cycle 8 only, because their values  could not be reliably estimated. Most patients had advanced-stage disease (Binet B or C for CLL, Ann Arbor 3–4 for FL or  DLBCL) and the median number of prior treatment lines was similar across lymphoma types (CLL,  2.0; DLBCL, 2.0; FL, 3.0) (Table 1).

The mean serum  This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. concentration-time profiles for obinutuzumab for patients from Cycle 1 to Cycle 8 are shown in  Figure 2. Derived PK parameters for all patient populations for Cycle 1 and Cycle 8 are summarised in  Table 2. Overall, comparison of Cmax and AUC21d as well as other derived PK parameters showed the  PK profile of obinutuzumab to be very similar for the three lymphoma types (Table 2). Mean serum  concentrations of obinutuzumab over Cycles 1–8 showed that Cmax and Ctrough steady-state levels  appeared to be achieved at the start of Cycle 2, irrespective of histology. Concentration–time profiles  were similar for the three lymphoma types (Figure 2), with a slight increase in serum levels of  obinutuzumab from Cycles 5/6–8 in patients with DLBCL or CLL. Systemic exposure to obinutuzumab  after the Cycle 8 dose (AUC21d value) was not dependent on body weight for any of the three  lymphoma types (Figure 3), although a slight trend for decreased AUC with increased body weight  was seen for FL patients (P = 0.286; P = 0.876 for DLBCL; P = 0.897 for CLL). Inter-subject variability  of obinutuzumab exposure appeared to be slightly higher for patients with CLL (CV% estimated to be  <43% for AUC and <33% for Cmax for both cycles) than for patients with DLBCL or FL (CV% estimated  to be <38% for AUC and <29% for Cmax for both cycles). ',\n"," 'Population pharmacokinetic analysis  Population PK analysis showed that most PK profiles from Chinese patients observed in GERSHWIN  lay within the 90% prediction interval of the simulated profiles, indicating that PK data in Chinese  patients were in agreement with the PK characteristics in non-Chinese lymphoma patients (which  were established previously using population PK methods) (Figure 4). Discussion  Non-compartmental analysis of Chinese patients in the Phase Ib GERSHWIN study showed that the  PK profile of obinutuzumab is similar in patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. Steady-state concentrations of obinutuzumab appeared to be reached at the start of Cycle 2 dosing irrespective of  histology, and there was no apparent relationship between body weight and AUC. addition,  estimated exposure at steady state (e.g. Cycle 8 AUC21d and Cmax) for Chinese patients with DLBCL  and FL was generally similar to that for Chinese patients with CLL. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. A two-compartment PK model comprising linear and non-linear time-varying clearance pathways has been shown to adequately describe serum obinutuzumab concentration data. The initial  clearance of obinutuzumab is more than two times higher than the steady-state clearance; this is  consistent with a decrease in the time-varying clearance component, which is high at the start of  treatment and then declines with administration of repeated cycles of obinutuzumab. The time-varying  clearance pathway is consistent with target-mediated drug disposition, such that at the start of  treatment, obinutuzumab is bound to a large quantity of CD20+ cells. With repeated dosing of  obinutuzumab, the pool of CD20+ cells becomes saturated, hence reducing the contribution of this  component to overall clearance. The linear clearance pathway is consistent with catabolism of  immunoglobulin G antibodies, and is therefore independent of CD20+ cells. These observations  support the need to minimise the time-varying clearance component quickly, and led to the proposed  obinutuzumab dose regimen of 1000 mg for both induction and extended treatment [13]. In addition to the non-compartmental PK analysis, a population PK assessment was performed to determine if data from GERSHWIN were in accordance with previously collected PK  data in mainly Caucasian patients for obinutuzumab. A population PK model comprising 961 patients  was used to simulate PK profiles in the current study. ',\n"," 'The results from this population PK analysis  support our main finding that observed obinutuzumab PK parameters are similar across Chinese and  non-Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL. The PK profile of obinutuzumab reported in the current study was similar to that reported in  two previous studies evaluating obinutuzumab PK in relapsed or refractory CLL and NHL patients  from Europe (GAUGUIN, Phase II) [9, 10, 14] and Japan (Phase I) [17] (Table 3). In a Phase II update  of the GAUGUIN study, 12 CLL and 47 NHL (relapsed/refractory) patients had PK data available at  Cycle 8. The NHL patients comprised 30 cases of indolent NHL (including FL) and 17 cases of  aggressive NHL (including DLBCL), and all patients were Caucasian except for one Asian patient with  CLL. The doses of obinutuzumab were 1000 mg for CLL and 400/800 mg for NHL. Notably, the  primary PK parameters for obinutuzumab at Cycle 8, i.e. geometric mean dose-adjusted Cmax, Ctrough  and AUC21d, were similar between GAUGUIN and the current study for both NHL and CLL (Cmax/dose  0.75–0.94 vs. 0.87–1.05 μg/ml/mg; Ctrough/dose 0.40–0.52 vs. 0.35–0.46 μg/ml/mg; AUC21d/dose 11.0– 14.7 vs. 11.3–13.0 day•µg/ml/mg) (Table 3). In the Phase I Japanese study, PK data were available  This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. for 10 patients with NHL across four dose cohorts at Cycle 8. Each cohort received a lower initial  obinutuzumab dose, which was then increased for the second and subsequent doses (i.e. 200/400  mg, 400/800 mg, 800/1200 mg, and 1200/2000 mg). All patients were Japanese and the majority had  FL. Despite the small sample size, the dose-adjusted PK data for obinutuzumab (Cmax/dose 0.87–1.50  μg/ml/mg; Ctrough/dose 0.36–1.05 μg/ml/mg; AUC21d/dose 9.0–14.9 day•µg/ml/mg) were comparable  with the data reported in the current study, which also had a relatively small sample size (n = 48). Notably, our finding that the PK profile of obinutuzumab is similar in Chinese vs. non-Chinese  patients is consistent with the similar PK profiles observed for other mAbs across ethnic populations. ',\n"," 'Both intrinsic (e.g. genetic and physiological differences) and extrinsic ethnic factors (e.g. cultural and  environmental differences) can impact on drug disposition, safety and efficacy; however, there is an  increasing body of evidence to suggest that ethnicity, after accounting for body weight differences,  may not influence the PK profile of biologics to the same degree that it does for small molecules [24]. Reasons for this include a lack of involvement of hepatic metabolism in the clearance and elimination  of mAbs and the fact that mAbs are administered parenterally, thereby avoiding any impact of dietary  factors on systemic exposure. This is also borne out by a recent review by Zhou et al. showing that  the dosing regimens of 12 mAbs approved in the USA and Japan are identical or very similar in both  countries [21]. In conclusion, we provide evidence that obinutuzumab exposure is comparable in Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL. Results indicate that PK characteristics in Chinese patients are  similar to those reported in non-Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, our population PK analysis confirms that the PK data observed are in agreement with  the previously established PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in non-Chinese patients with CLL,  DLBCL and FL.

Summary Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) detection is a promising monitoring tool for lymphoid malignan- cies. We evaluated whether the presence of ctDNA was associated with out- come after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in lymphoma patients. We studied 88 patients drawn from a phase 3 clinical trial of reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT in lymphoma. Conventional restaging and collection of peripheral blood samples occurred at pre-speci- fied time points before and after HSCT and were assayed for ctDNA by sequencing of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes. Tumour clonotypes were identified in 87% of patients with adequate tumour sam- ples. Sixteen of 19 (84%) patients with disease progression after HSCT had detectable ctDNA prior to progression at a median of 3 7 months prior to relapse/progression. Patients with detectable ctDNA 3 months after HSCT had inferior progression-free survival (PFS) (2-year PFS 58% vs. 84% in ctDNA-negative patients, P = 0 033). In multivariate models, detectable ctDNA was associated with increased risk of progression/death (Hazard ratio 3 9, P = 0 003) and increased risk of relapse/progression (Hazard ratio 10 8, P = 0 0006). ',\n"," 'Detectable ctDNA is associated with an increased risk of relapse/progression, but further validation studies are necessary to confirm these findings and determine the clinical utility of NGS-based min- imal residual disease monitoring in lymphoma patients after HSCT. Keywords: lymphomas, minimal residual disease, stem cell transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Relapse is a main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with lymphoma (Armand et al, 2008; Devetten et al, 2009; Bacher et al, 2012; Robinson et al, 2013; Smith et al, 2013; Fenske et al, 2014). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), which is associated with a lower risk of transplant-related mortality, has extended the availability of HSCT to older and frailer populations, but carries an increased risk of relapse (Khouri et al, 1998; Armand et al, 2008; Sorror et al, 2008; Thomson et al, 2009). Early detection of relapse after HSCT could potentially be used to guide pre-emptive intervention, but post-HSCT disease monitoring methods in patients with lymphoma are typically restricted to radiological and bone marrow studies, which have limited sensitivity to detect low volume disease (Barrington et al, 2014). Monitoring for min- imal residual disease (MRD) in a range of haematological malignancies can identify patients at high risk of relapse after standard therapy and HSCT (Radich et al, 1995; Raff et al, 2007; Zhou et al, 2007; Ritgen et al, 2008; Bottcher et al, 2011, 2012; Ferrero et al, 2011; Walter et al, 2013). research paper ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology doi: 10.1111/bjh.14311 effective MRD assay that could identify lymphoma patients at increased risk for relapse after HSCT would be a powerful tool for developing relapse prevention strategies. However, MRD monitoring techniques are not available for most lym- phoma subtypes, particularly when there is no peripheral blood involvement or characteristic chromosomal rearrange- ment (Gribben et al, 1991, 1993; Corradini et al, 2004; Man- cuso et al, 2010). Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based MRD detection using the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes (Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp., South San Francisco, CA, USA) can identify circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma (cell-free) of patients with lymphoid malignancies. ',\n"," 'detect MRD not identified by multi-para- meter flow cytometry or allele-specific oligonucleotide poly- merase chain reaction testing (Faham et al, 2012; Logan et al, 2013; Ladetto et al, 2014). The NGS-based MRD detec- tion method can identify ctDNA at diagnosis in a range of lymphomas, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), subtypes in which MRD detection has previously been challenging (Armand et al, 2013; Kurtz et al, 2015; Oki et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). In addition, ctDNA levels track with treatment response in DLBCL, and the persistence or recur- rence of ctDNA during and after upfront therapy is associ- ated with subsequent DLBCL relapse (Kurtz et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). Following HSCT for acute lym- phoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukae- mia (CLL), ctDNA is associated with subsequent relapse and poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (Logan et al, 2013, 2014). In the present pilot study, we evaluated whether ctDNA detected by the NGS-based MRD assessment method is associated with relapse and survival in patients with lym- phoma undergoing RIC HSCT. Methods We performed a retrospective study using research samples collected as part of a prospective, multi-centre, open-label, phase III randomized clinical trial evaluating the addition of sirolimus to the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophy- laxis regimen of patients with lymphoma undergoing RIC allogeneic HSCT (Armand et al, 2016a). The clinical trial and this retrospective study were approved by the Institu- tional Review Board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/ Harvard Cancer Center. Informed consent was obtained at the time of clinical trial enrolment in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Cohort Adult patients aged 18–72 years old with HL, CLL, B- or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (excluding Burkitt lymphoma and MYC-rearranged DLBCL) undergoing their first allogeneic HSCT with an 8/8 human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated allogeneic donor were eligible for the clinical trial. Between June 2009 and Septem- ber 2012, 139 patients were enrolled to the clinical trial, including 118 participants enrolled at the Dana–Farber Can- cer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital who were eligible for this retrospective study. Details of the transplan- tation regimen are described elsewhere (Armand et al, 2016a). Participants underwent conventional restaging at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, as per protocol. Acute and chronic GVHD were graded by the treating physician according to the relevant guidelines (Shulman et al, 1980; Przepiorka et al, 1995). ',\n"," 'PBMC and plasma (2–3 6 ml) samples were prospec- tively collected and banked prior to HSCT and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after HSCT, or until relapse. Only patients who consented to optional research specimen collec- tion and use at the time of informed consent and who had available archival biopsy samples containing sufficient tumour for nucleic acid extraction and sequencing analysis (approximately ≥15 ng of DNA) were included in this retro- spective study. Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene sequencing Genomic tumour DNA was extracted from archival forma- lin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or bone marrow aspirate mononuclear cells and analysed as previously described (Faham et al, 2012). In brief, polymerase chain reaction amplification of IGH VDJ, IGH DJ, IGK, TRB (TCR-beta), TRD (TCR-delta) and/or TRG (TCR-gamma) regions was performed using universal consensus primers fol- lowed by next-generation sequencing to determine the tumour clonotype(s) (Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp.). tumour clonotype was defined as a clone with a frequency of >5% in the tumour specimen. DNA from banked plasma and PBMC samples was extracted using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) for cell- free DNA and the AllPrep kit (Qiagen) for cell-based DNA. DNA was amplified using universal consensus primers and sequenced. The abundance of ctDNA was quantified relative to the total number of sequencing reads in a specimen – the number of lymphoma molecules per diploid genome sequenced. Both plasma and PBMCs were evaluated in all patients at all time points when specimens were available. Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics were reported descriptively. Fisher’s exact test or a Chi-square test was used for group compar- ison of categorical variables. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for group comparison of continuous variables. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were calculated using the Kaplan– Meier method. OS was defined as the time from stem cell infusion until death from any cause. Patients who were alive Herrera et al 2 ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology or lost to follow-up were censored at the time last seen alive. PFS was defined as the time from stem cell infusion until progression of disease or death from any cause. Patients who were alive without disease relapse or progres- sion were censored at the time last seen alive and progres- sion-free. ',\n"," 'Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse/progression (CIR) were calculated reflecting time to non-relapse death and time to relapse, respectively, as competing risks. The log-rank test was used to compare OS and PFS between subgroups, while the Gray test (Gray, 1988) was used to compare NRM and CIR inci- dences. A sample was considered positive for ctDNA if there were ANY detectable lymphoma molecules in the specimen. A patient was considered ctDNA positive at a given time point if ctDNA was detected in at least one sample tested from that time point, i.e. PBMC and/or plasma. The end- points of interest for this study were CIR and PFS. Univari- ate and multivariate analyses for CIR and PFS were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model treating ctDNA positivity as a time-dependent covariate along with disease status at HSCT and lymphoma histology. All tests were two-sided at the significance level of 0 05. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9 3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results Patients and HSCT outcomes Among the 139 patients enrolled on the clinical trial, 88 had paired tumour and blood samples available for analyses. Ten patients did not have sufficient tumour DNA for clonotype analysis and were not included in the study. Among the remaining 78, identification of a tumour clonotype was suc- cessful in 68 patients: 63 of 69 (91%) patients with NHL or CLL and 5 of 9 (55%) HL patients. Compared to the 71 patients who were not evaluable for ctDNA, these 68 patients were on average older and more commonly received stem cells from an unrelated donor (data not shown); despite those differences, their outcomes were similar [2-year PFS 61% in evaluable ctDNA cohort versus 58% (P = 0 5), and 2-year OS 71% vs. 68% (P = 0 4)]. The baseline characteris- tics of the 68 patients with identifiable tumour clonotypes and paired blood samples for ctDNA analysis are listed in Table I. There were 37 patients (54%) with B-cell NHL, 10 (15%) with T-cell NHL, 5 (7%) with HL and 16 (24%) with CLL. A summary of the clonotype identification rate by lym- phoma subtype is included in Table II. The median follow-up time for survivors was 33 months (3–60 months). Estimated 2-year PFS and OS in the cohort of 68 patients were 62% and 71%, respectively. ',\n"," 'Nineteen patients relapsed during the course of the study, at a median time of 3 9 months (range 1–28 months) from HSCT. The 2-year CIR was 25% and the 2-year incidence of NRM was 13%. PBMCs versus plasma results Cryopreserved peripheral blood samples (n = 797) were eval- uated for ctDNA, including 399 PBMC and 398 plasma sam- ples. The median concentration of cells in PBMC samples was 10 8 9106 mononuclear cells (range, 1–24 8 9 106 cells), and a median of 710 018 PBMC genomes (range, 9 146– 3 915 959) and 1 418 plasma genomes (range, 33–237 509) were analysed in each type of specimen. ctDNA was detected in 33% of PBMC and 25% of plasma specimens tested. Dis- cordance between PBMC and plasma samples, defined as detection of ctDNA in one type of specimen but not in the other, occurred at 85 of 386 (22%) time points in which both types of sample were tested.

PBMC /plasma+ discordance usually occurred in aggressive lymphoma subtypes: 86% of occurrences were in patients with DLBCL, HL or trans- formed indolent B-NHL. ctDNA positivity and outcome ctDNA analysis was performed at ≥1 time point in all 68 patients (Fig 1). Prior to HSCT, ctDNA was present in PBMCs or plasma in 55% of patients tested, including 9 of 23 (39%) patients in complete response (CR), 14 of 20 (70%) patients in partial response, 2 of 3 (67%) of patients with stable disease, and 1 (100%) patient with progressive disease. Using conventional staging methods as the gold stan- dard, the sensitivity of the assay was 71% for the detection of residual disease prior to HSCT. Baseline ctDNA status was not significantly associated with outcome: 2-year estimated CIR was 35% in ctDNA-positive versus 20% in ctDNA-nega- tive patients (p = 0 4) and 2-year PFS was 50% vs. 71% (P = 0 19). ctDNA was detectable in 60% of patients at 1 month, 55% at 2 months and 52% at 3 months. The proportion of patients with detectable ctDNA declined at time points fur- ther from HSCT: 36% at 6 months, 21% at 1 year and 10% at 2 years. Receipt of sirolimus did not impact the rates of ctDNA-positivity at baseline (50% ctDNA-positive in siroli- mus-receiving patients vs. 61% in control, P = 0 6) or 3 months after HSCT (48% sirolimus vs. 56% control, P = 0 8). At 1, 2 and 3 months after HSCT, detectable ctDNA had a sensitivity of 69%, 73% and 73%, respectively, for subsequent relapse/disease progression and a specificity of 45%, 55% and 55%, respectively. Among the 52 patients evaluated for ctDNA at 3 months after HSCT, the 2-year estimated CIR was 27% in patients who were ctDNA-positive versus 8% in ctDNA-negative patients (P = 0 12); 2-year NRM was 15% vs. 8% (P = 0 3); and 2-year PFS was 58% vs. 84% (P = 0 033), respectively (Fig 2). Overall, among the 19 patients who had progression or relapse after HSCT, ctDNA was detected prior to or at the time of relapse/progression in 17 (89%) patients. ',\n"," 'One patient with HL was ctDNA-negative prior to relapse, but had detectable ctDNA at the time of relapse. Thus, ctDNA was detected overall in 16 of 19 (84%) patients prior to docu- mented relapse or progression (Fig 1). In patients with detectable ctDNA prior to relapse, ctDNA was detected at a median of 3 7 months (range, 1–26 months) prior to relapse/progression. We examined the concordance between ctDNA and con- ventional restaging in patients who relapsed/progressed (Fig 1). Seven patients had detectable ctDNA in the setting of negative imaging at ≥1 time point prior to the docu- mented relapse/progression event. One of these patients later had imaging confirmation of isolated central nervous system relapse of DLBCL and negative ctDNA at that time. Only one patient had imaging consistent with relapsed systemic lymphoma but undetectable ctDNA. Another patient was ctDNA-negative at the only time point evaluated (1 month), but did not have a sample evaluable for ctDNA when imag- ing demonstrated relapse 3 5 months after HSCT. In the remaining 10 patients, detectable ctDNA either occurred between disease reassessment time points (i.e. 1, 2 or 9 months after HSCT) prior to subsequent concordant ctDNA-positive documented relapse (n = 6) or ctDNA-posi- tivity was concordant with active, stable or relapsed disease determined by conventional restaging methods (n = 4). Kinetic patterns of ctDNA after HSCT In patients with more than one ctDNA sampling time point prior to relapse, death or data censoring (n = 64), we observed kinetic patterns to describe the presence or absence of ctDNA before and after HSCT. Thirteen patients had detectable ctDNA at all time points tested, and nine (69%) of these patients had relapse/progression after HSCT. Two persistently ctDNA-positive CLL patients did not have dis- ease progression but actually had evidence of persistent active disease after HSCT and had detectable ctDNA at all time points tested. These patients were not formally considered as having relapse/progression because there was no overt Table II. Clonotype identification summary.

Eighteen patients were ctDNA-negative at all time points measured, and only 2 (11%) of these per- sistently ctDNA-negative patients relapsed. Eight patients had a mixed ctDNA pattern, with alternating periods of ctDNA- positivity and ctDNA clearance, among whom 2 relapsed. Three patients who were initially ctDNA-negative subse- quently became ctDNA-positive after HSCT without subse- quent ctDNA clearance. Two of these were DLBCL patients (Fig 1, patients 40 and 43) who became ctDNA-positive late after HSCT, at 9 months and 18 months, and subsequently relapsed at 10 and 24 months, respectively. An HL patient (Fig 1, patient 65) was ctDNA-negative prior to HSCT and then became ctDNA positive 1 month after HSCT and remained ctDNA-positive until relapse 3 months after HSCT. Twenty-two patients were consistently ctDNA-positive at ≥1 time point followed by permanent clearance of ctDNA. No patient with delayed, permanent ctDNA clearance had relapse or progression.

In 68% of patients with delayed ctDNA clear- ance, the onset of GVHD occurred before or within 3 months after the transition from ctDNA-positive to ctDNA-negative (Fig 1). All 21 patients with permanent ctDNA clearance who had GVHD remained free from relapse. ',\n"," 'The proportions of patients who had delayed ctDNA clearance, or were persistently ctDNA positive or negative, were similar among patients who received sirolimus as GVHD prophylaxis compared to patients in the control group (P = 0 2). Multivariate analysis A multivariate model was constructed with histology and dis- ease status at HSCT as covariates, and ctDNA-positivity included as a time-dependent covariate. ctDNA-positivity was associated with an increased risk of progression or death, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3 9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1 6–9 5; P = 0 003], as well as an increased risk of dis- ease relapse/progression (HR 10 8, 95% CI 2 8–42 2, P = 0 0006). Histology and disease status were not signifi- cantly associated with either outcome in the model. When acute and chronic GVHD were entered into the proportional hazards model as time-dependent covariates, along with remission status and ctDNA-positivity; chronic GVHD was associated with a lower risk of disease relapse/progression (HR 0 2, 95% CI 0 05–0 96, P = 0 045), while ctDNA-posi- tivity remained associated with an increased risk of disease relapse/progression (HR 8 2, 95% CI 2 5–26 6, P = 0 0004). ctDNA and chimerism In surviving patients with available chimerism, the median total and T-cell donor chimerism at 3 months after HSCT were 97% (n = 60, range, 32–100%) and 90% (n = 49, range, 8–100), respectively. Bivariate landmark analyses at 3 months after HSCT with ctDNA-positivity and total or T-cell chimerism as covariates showed that the presence of ctDNA was independently associated with an increased risk of progression or death (HR 2 9, 95% CI 1 02–8 4, P = 0 046), as was total donor chimerism <90% (HR 3 6, 95% CI 1 13–11 4, p = 0 030). T-cell chimerism was not sig- nificantly associated with outcome in the model when ctDNA-positivity was considered. Discussion NGS-based MRD assessment by immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene sequencing is highly sensitive and has shown promise in a range of lymphoid malignancies (Faham et al, 2012; Gawad et al, 2012; Armand et al, 2013, 2016b; Logan et al, 2013, 2014; Ladetto et al, 2014; Kurtz et al, 2015; Oki et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). ',\n"," 'In the present study, we report the first use of NGS-based MRD detection of lym- phoma after allogeneic RIC HSCT in a cohort of patients with a large variety of histologies, including HL, CLL, B-cell NHL and T-cell NHL. With a successful clonotype identifica- tion rate of 91% in NHL and CLL patients with adequate archival tumour samples, this technique is readily applicable to the majority of lymphoma patients undergoing HSCT. The exception was the clonotype identification rate (55%) in HL patients with adequate tumour samples, which is lower than was observed in a previous report (Oki et al, 2015). This may be explained by the histological characteristics of HL, in which there are few malignant cells among many reactive, inflammatory cells. Thus, in some patients with HL and the small proportion of patients with NHL and CLL in whom no clonotype can be identified, this technique may not be applicable. Overall, ctDNA was detected in 55% of patients prior to HSCT, including 39% of patients considered to be in CR at the time of HSCT. Some patients with persistent disease prior to HSCT by conventional restaging did not have detectable ctDNA, which may reflect limitations of the assay but also probably reflects the common occurrence of false positive fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) after standard therapy (Moskowitz et al, 2010). Some degree of discordance between conventional restaging and this technique is expected, as other studies have reported a ctDNA-positivity rate of 81–92% at the time of diagnosis in patients with DLBCL (Armand et al, 2013; Kurtz et al, 2015; Roschewski et al, 2015). Therefore, in a small propor- tion of patients in whom a clonotype can be identified, the assay may not be useful for tracking disease. In addition to discordance between conventional restaging methods and ctDNA assessment, discordance between the presence of ctDNA in PBMC versus plasma samples from the same patient assessed at the same time point was common. aggressive lymphomas, evaluation of plasma appeared more sensitive for the detection of ctDNA, which may reflect higher cell turnover and shedding of cell-free ctDNA in these subtypes. Furthermore, testing for ctDNA in the PBMC com- partment may be impacted by persistent leucopenia after HSCT, which could potentially limit sensitivity. This may be especially true in patients who receive more intensive condi- tioning or grafts from alternative donors, in whom engraft- ment may be slower. ',\n"," 'Therefore, in future studies, evaluation of both PBMC and plasma should be performed when possi- ble to maximize the sensitivity of the assay. In parallel to the high rates of MRD-positivity observed early after HSCT in other studies of MRD monitoring after RIC HSCT, many patients had detectable ctDNA in the early post-HSCT period (Dreger et al, 2010; Logan et al, 2013). The proportion of patients with detectable ctDNA remained relatively stable until 3 months after HSCT then declined steadily. The decreasing proportion of ctDNA-positive patients was partially due to drop out of patients with relapse/progression. However, approximately one-third of patients had permanent clearance of ctDNA after initial ctDNA-positivity. This kinetic pattern of ctDNA clearance Herrera et al 6 ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology was associated with freedom from relapse (no relapses in our cohort) and similar patterns of delayed MRD clearance have been observed in studies of MRD monitoring after HSCT in other diseases (Miglino et al, 2002; Moreno et al, 2006; Rit- gen et al, 2008; Farina et al, 2009; Dreger et al, 2010). Delayed ctDNA clearance may have been temporally related with immunosuppression taper, which started at day +100 per protocol. Most patients (68%) with delayed ctDNA clear- ance developed GVHD prior to or around the time of the transition between ctDNA-positive to ctDNA-negative. Fur- thermore, in some patients with a mixed ctDNA pattern, periods of ctDNA clearance were immediately preceded by the onset of GVHD. In other studies of MRD monitoring after RIC HSCT, clearance of MRD was often associated with the onset of GVHD or immunosuppression taper (Moreno et al, 2006; Ritgen et al, 2008; Farina et al, 2009; Dreger et al, 2010) The relationship between GVHD and disappear- ance of ctDNA observed in this study is evidence of a graft- versus-lymphoma effect. In our study, nearly all (89%) patients with relapse or progression of disease after HSCT had detectable ctDNA prior to or at the time of relapse/progression. Eighty-four per cent of patients had detectable ctDNA at 1 or more time point prior to relapse/progression, and the median lead-time of ctDNA-positivity prior to relapse/progression was more than 3 months. Many relapses were detected radiographically as part of the protocol-specified disease reassessments rather than clinically-detected relapses; therefore, the lead-time interval we observed was partly a function of the protocol- driven timing of blood draws and disease reassessments. ',\n"," 'Notably, prior to the time point of confirmed relapse, several patients who ultimately relapsed had detectable ctDNA in the setting of negative imaging, while ctDNA-negativity with positive imaging occurred less frequently. Our findings sug- gest that NGS-based assessment of ctDNA after HSCT is very sensitive for relapse. This high sensitivity could possibly allow more judicious use of routine restaging scans, which are associated with significant costs and radiation expo- sure. (Brenner & Hall, 2007; Berrington de Gonzalez et al, 2009) Because we evaluated the assay as a method of predict- ing future relapse/progression, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the assay to be reflective of subsequent relapse, rather than active disease at a particular time point. Therefore, the calculated sensitivity at early post-HSCT time points was relatively lower, as there were patients who had no detectable ctDNA and negative imaging early after HSCT but later became ctDNA positive at least 1 time point prior to subsequent relapse/progression, which has been observed in other studies using this technique (Roschewski et al, 2015). Although NGS-based ctDNA detection appeared sensitive for relapse, there were patients who had detectable ctDNA after HSCT who did not relapse. This apparent lack of speci- ficity of the assay is at least partly explained by the distinc- tion between residual disease and relapse/progression in the clinical trial. Some patients enrolled in the clinical trial had residual disease prior to and after HSCT but were never clas- sified as having frank relapse or progression. As a result, there were patients with evidence of active, stable disease by conventional restaging methods after HSCT in whom the assay appropriately detected ctDNA, but appeared to have falsely positive MRD status because they did not relapse or progress. More generally, this high early “false positive” rate reflects the realities of RIC HSCT – less intensive condition- ing therapy results in more macro- or microscopic residual disease in the early post-HSCT period, with graft-versus- tumour effects developing over time. Thus, the presence of ctDNA after HSCT in many patients who do not ultimately relapse or progress would be expected. Nevertheless, ctDNA positivity at 3 months after HSCT was significantly associ- ated with inferior PFS. In addition, multivariate analyses confirmed that detectable ctDNA was independently associ- ated with an increased risk of relapse/progression and pro- gression/death, even when GVHD and total or T-cell donor chimerism were taken into account. ',\n"," 'If these findings can be validated in other studies and the specificity for subsequent relapse could be improved, detectable ctDNA after HSCT may provide an actionable result for therapeutic intervention to forestall clinically overt relapse. One of the strengths of this study – the variety of histolo- gies included – is also a limitation. The heterogeneous mix- ture of patients with different subtypes of NHL and HL limits our ability to draw conclusions about the assay’s per- formance in individual lymphoma subtypes. In addition, although we started with a possible study population of 118 patients, only 88 patients had archival tissue available for tumour clonotype identification, only 78 had sufficient tumour DNA for evaluation, and 68 patients with an ade- quate tumour sample had a tumour clonotype successfully identified. Differing tissue fixation techniques utilized at the various institutions from which tumour tissue was obtained and originally processed may have impacted tumour clono- type identification. Even among patients with an identifiable clonotype, there were missing blood samples despite the prospectively planned sample collection within the context of a clinical trial. The missing time points decrease the power of the study, particularly in patients with early relapse and few opportunities to detect ctDNA prior to progression. More generally, these issues highlight the importance of prospectively archiving tumour samples and of routinely and frequently collecting PBMC and plasma samples whenever possible in patients in whom MRD measurement may become desirable at some point in their treatment course. Finally, as this study only examined patients who underwent RIC HSCT using fully HLA-matched or single mismatched donors, we are unable to comment about the assay’s utility in patients who receive more intensive conditioning or a graft from other donor types. In this pilot study of NGS-based ctDNA detection in patients with lymphoma undergoing HSCT, we observed that NGS-Based ctDNA Detection After HSCT for Lymphoma ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology 7 the presence of ctDNA after HSCT was associated with an increased risk of relapse and inferior PFS. Although our find- ings are promising, validation studies with pre-defined end- points are necessary. With further validation, the detection of ctDNA in the setting of radiographic disease progression could also potentially serve to confirm disease recurrence without the need for a tissue biopsy. ',\n"," 'Further studies are required to establish the clinical utility of NGS-based ctDNA detection after HSCT, including how best to prospectively incorporate this assay into post-HSCT monitoring, the utility of the test in specific lymphoma subtypes, and whether the test is sufficiently specific to justify MRD-based intervention. We have identified specific situations that appear to be promising targets for further exploration, including ctDNA status in conjunction with GVHD status and ctDNA-positiv- ity 3 months after HSCT. As interest grows in novel approaches for preventing relapse after HSCT, NGS-based MRD detection should be incorporated into prospective clin- ical trials to further study and optimize the use of this poten- tially promising technique in this patient population.

The nerve involvement was the only CG- related clinical manifestation in four patients; three of whom had confounding factors, such as alcoholism and/or vitamin B deficiency. These three patients had moderate symptoms and did not receive any specific treatment. Six patients had central neurological manifestations: four presented isolated ischaemic strokes and two had impaired consciousness associated with convulsions in the context of a systemic presentation with multivisceral manifestations, fever and polyarthralgia. Miscellaneous Five patients presented with systemic symptoms (fever >38°C, asthenia and weight loss) that were associated with cutaneous manifestations, particularly necrotic purpura of the extremities, and polyarthralgia in four.

Summary This retrospective analysis was conducted in 64 patients diagnosed with type I cryoglobulinaemia (CG) followed at two French centres. Median fol- low-up was 6 75 years. CG was IgG in 60% and IgM in 40% of all cases and was asymptomatic in 16 patients (25%). Cold-triggered ischaemic skin manifestations were observed in 33 patients (51%). Neurological manifesta- tions were observed in 15 patients and renal manifestations in 13. ',\n"," 'Most of the patients with necrotic purpura (14/16, P = 0 009) and renal manifesta- tions (11/13, P = 0 057) had IgG CG. IgG CG was associated with mono- clonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma in 18, 13, 5 and 2 patients, respectively. IgM CG was associated with MGUS and Waldenstr€om macroglobulinaemia in 8 and 18 cases, respectively. One third of patients did not receive any specific treatment. Various treatments, including rituximab, were administered to 25/31 patients with IgG CG and 6/25 patients with IgM CG due to CG-related symptoms. Rituximab was ineffective in all cases associated with a predominantly plasmacytic prolifer- ation. To conclude, type I CG has specific clinico-biological characteristics compared to type II CG. Furthermore, there are differences in terms of related manifestations between type I IgG and type I IgM CG. Keywords: monoclonal gammopathy, cryoglobulinaemia. The medical condition cryoglobulinaemia (CG) is character- ized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the serum. Cryo- globulins are immunoglobulins (Ig) that precipitate when the serum drops to a temperature lower than 37°C and dissolve again once the serum is heated. Three types of CG have been described (Brouet et al, 1974): type I, or monoclonal CG, is composed of a monoclonal Ig (mIg); type II, ‘mixed’ CG, is composed of an mIg (usually an IgMj with rheumatoid fac- tor (RF) activity) associated with polyclonal Igs; and type III, which is also known as polyclonal CG. Both type I and II CG are characterized by an mIg and, accordingly, by the presence of an underlying B-cell clone. This can result in an overt lymphoid proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstr€om macroglobulinaemia (WM) or a type of lym- phoma, or be silent corresponding to the definition of a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (Retamozo et al, 2013). In contrast to the numerous works that have been con- ducted on type II CG, particularly since the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been identified as its major cause (Ramos-Casals et al, 2012), there are only a few publications specifically reporting data on type I CG. We report a well-defined series of patients with this type of CG, providing further evidence that type I and type II CGs are distinct entities from clinical, histological and physico-pathological points of view. ',\n"," 'Patients and methods Our series of patients was retrospectively composed by com- bining a random approach with an oriented approach. The random series constituted all cases of type I CG identified by routine laboratory tests in patients presenting at a multidisci- plinary hospital, Strasbourg University Hospital, over a 4-year period (15 May 2006 to 31 May 2010). This series was combined with an oriented series composed of all patients diagnosed with type I CG that were followed in a specialized haematology centre: the Immuno-Haematology Unit of Paris-Saint-Louis Hospital. research paper ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology doi: 10.1111/bjh.13196 In all cases, CG was detected on a blood sample that was collected and transported at 37°C. The blood sample was left to clot at the same temperature and the centrifuged serum was then placed at 2–4°C for 7–8 days. At this time, if a pre- cipitate was discernible, it was washed three times at 4°C to remove any contaminating serum components. The CG was then semi-quantified (either using a pyrogallol red method or by evaluating a cryocrite), re-dissolved at 37°C and char- acterized by immunofixation. Patients were classified according to Brouet et al (1974). Only cases where the CG could be classified without any ambi- guity were included. Patients presenting with a low amount of IgM were carefully checked, particularly if they were HCV- positive and/or had mIgM RF activity, suggesting that they were more likely to have type II rather than type I CG. Available medical files and biological results of all patients with type I CG were retrospectively reviewed. All patients who were alive at the time of the study gave their informed consent. The results were compared to data from a literature review that was performed using the PubMed database with the terms ‘monoclonal cryoglobulinaemia’ and ‘cryoglobuli- naemia’. Results Out of the 6428 sera tested for CG in Strasbourg Hospital during the 4-year study period, 300 (4 7%) were positive. Thirty-one of these (10 3%) were characterized as type I CG. Four of these cases could not be included because of incom- plete or questionable data. In Paris Saint-Louis Hospital, 41 patients with a validated diagnosis of type I CG were identi- fied. Four cases could not be included because of incomplete data. Overall, 64 patients were analysed. ',\n"," 'Cutaneous symptoms were the only manifesta- tion of the CG in 12 patients. In five patients, symptoms were considered as too discrete to require any specific ther- apy, except avoiding exposure to the cold. In contrast, three patients had to undergo amputation of fingers or toes due to severe necrosis. When available (n = 9), histological examination of cuta- neous lesions usually showed a thrombotic vasculopathy, with capillary thromboses of the upper dermis and non- inflammatory purpura (Figs 1B and C). A significant perivas- cular cell infiltrate was reported in only one case. Vessel thrombosis was due to intravascular amorphous eosinophilic periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) positive material. It was associated with endothelial proliferation corresponding to glomeruloid reactive angioendotheliomatosis in two cases (Fig 2). In the only case with interpretable immunofluorescence (IF) data, the intravascular thrombi were stained only by the antisera specific for the light and heavy chain isotype of the CG. Renal manifestations Nine of the 13 patients who had had renal symptoms at some point were biopsied. The patient with salivary gland AL amyloidosis and pure nephrotic syndrome was not con- sidered as having renal complications due to CG. All of these 13 patients had high-grade proteinuria pre- dominantly consisting of albumin, including eight who had a nephrotic syndrome. It was pure in one case, whereas three had renal failure and four had hypertension and/or haematu- ria. Five patients had recurrent flares characterized by nephritic syndrome, acute renal failure and severe hyperten- sion. Renal involvement was isolated, associated with cutane- ous symptoms or with systemic symptoms in seven, three and three patients, respectively. It was present at diagnosis in seven patients and occurred during disease progression in the other six. Eleven of the 38 patients with IgG CG had renal involve- ment, as compared to two of the 26 patients with IgM CG (P = 0 057 by Fisher’s test). Histologically, the disease was characterized by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with glomerular thrombi and micro-tubular deposits in seven Table II. Clinical manifestations according to type I CG isotype. ',\n"," 'The mean age at diagnosis was 62 years, there were 33 women and 31 men, and median follow-up was 6 75 years. In nearly half of the patients, the CG was incidentally dis- covered during the work-up for a monoclonal gammapathy or a lymphoid disorder. In these cases, CG was diagnosed following a cold-induced serum precipitate that alerted the pathologist. In 32 patients (50%), the patients were tested for CG because of cutaneous symptoms. Otherwise, the CG was discovered because of renal (n = 7) or neurological (n = 8) complications. Five patients had systemic disease (see below). Biological characteristics The 64 monoclonal CG were of the IgM or IgG isotype in 26 (40%) and 38 (60%) cases, respectively. There were 19 IgMj, 7 IgMk, 22 IgGj and 16 IgGk. In four cases, a second mIg was detected by serum immunofixation but only one of these was cryoprecipitating. The two IgG that were subclassified belonged to IgG1 and IgG3 isotype. At diagnosis, the CG amount was low (≤0 1 g/l or cryocrite ≤1%, n = 17), medium (≤1 g/l or cryocrite ≤2%, n = 19), high (≤5 g/l or cryocrite ≤10%, n = 14), very high (≤20 g/l or cryocrite ≤50%, n = 10) or massive (>20 g/l or cryocrite >50%, n = 4). As assessed by serum electrophoresis, the serum level of the mIg was not always correlated with the estimated amount of the CG. Two patients had mIg of 30 g/l or more, contrast- ing with a low (<2%) cryocrite (1 IgMj, 1 IgGj). Serum complement levels (CH50, C3 and C4) were in normal ranges in 26 of the 48 evaluable patients. A decrease in CH50 and/or C4 levels was observed in 22 patients, nine of whom also had a low C3 serum level. There was no corre- lation between complement status and clinical symptoms. Forty-one patients were tested for serum RF and 37 for anti- nuclear antibodies and were positive in two and five cases, respectively. Associated disorders In all but four patients the work-up included at least one bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. All patients with an IgG CG had a complete bone survey (Table I). All patients with an IgM CG had a thoraco-abdominal computerized tomogra- phy-scan or at least an ultrasound examination of the abdo- men. A lymph node biopsy was performed in all of the six patients with sizeable peripheral lymphadenopathy. ',\n"," 'Twenty-six patients (40%) were considered to have a MGUS whereas 38 patients (60%) had an overt lymphopro- liferative disorder. The 38 patients with an IgG CG were ini- tially diagnosed with MGUS (n = 18), MM (n = 13, including 11 indolent MM), lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma (LPL) (n = 2) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 5, including one case with auto-immune haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia). During follow-up, one MGUS patient and two with indolent MM developed a symptomatic MM. In one case, an IgGj MGUS was associ- ated with a necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Among the 26 patients with an IgM CG, 18 presented with WM that was asymptomatic in seven cases, symptomatic Table I. Associated disorders at diagnosis.

In two patients, a cryoprecipitating IgM MGUS featured a cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Two patients with an IgM CG were also diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, on a salivary gland biopsy in one case (performed because of a pure nephrotic syndrome) and on a lymph node biopsy in the other. One patient with an IgMj MGUS also had type 1 Gaucher disease. CG-related manifestations Cutaneous symptoms. At diagnosis and during follow-up, 33 patients (51%) – 23 with an IgG CG and 10 with an IgM – had cutaneous involvement attributable to CG (Table II). variably combined the following: Raynaud phenomenon (n = 12), livedo reticularis (n = 11), recurrent episodes of cold-induced necrotic purpura of the extremities (n = 16) and urticaria, either cold-related (n = 5) or not (n = 3) (Fig 1A). Of the 16 patients with necrotic purpura, 14 had an IgG CG whereas only two had an IgM CG (P = 0 009 by Fisher test). ',\n"," 'In addition, two had a peripheral sensorimotorneuropathyandthreedisplayedischaemicvisceral manifestations including cerebral manifestations and mesen- teric ischaemia. Three patients presented with acute kidney fail- ure and one of these also had heart failure. Three of these patients had an IgG CG and two an IgM CG. Microscopical examinationof the cryoprecipitate showed the presenceofcrys- tals with thin needles in one case with an IgG3 CG. In three cases, the CG serum level was high, one was medium and the onewithcrystalshadalowlevel. Apart from the patients with systemic presentation, eight patients had articular manifestations, namely inflammatory poly- or oligo-arthralgia. These were never isolated and usu- ally associated with cutaneous symptoms. No joint aspira- tions or synovial biopsies were performed. Arterial ischaemic manifestations occurred in three patients [spleen infarction (n = 1), suspicion of mesenteric ischaemia (n = 1) and acute ischaemia of the leg (n = 1)] and thrombo-embolic events were observed in eight patients, four of whom had detectable serum antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment. Eighteen patients (28%) did not receive any spe- cific treatment at any time, including 11 of the 38 patients with IgG CG and seven of the 26 patients with IgM CG. Among these untreated patients, 11 had an MGUS (seven IgG, four IgM), four had CLL and three had indolent WM. Two haemodialysed patients did not receive any specific treatment because they had no other organ failure and were too frail. Forty-six patients received chemotherapy. Indications to treat were linked to the underlying haemopathy in 15 patients, because of high tumour mass (MM, n = 2; WM, n = 9 including two with Richter syndrome) or of associated manifestations such as CAD, AL amyloidosis and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (Fig 3). Treatment was initiated because of CG-related symptoms in 31 patients, including 25 of the 38 patients with IgG CG (66%) and six of the 26 patients with IgM CG (24%). Patients with IgG CG and MGUS or MM received various standard dose chemotherapeutic regimens either based on al- kylating agents (n = 13, 42%), anthracycline (n = 1, 3%), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (n = 9, 29%) or bortezo- mib (n = 10, 32%). Four (10%) were treated by high dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Seven others received repeated injections of ritux- imab. The three patients with IgG CG and CLL or LPL received a combination of rituximab and cyclophosphamide. ',\n"," 'Patients with IgM CG were treated by an alkylating agent- based regimen (n = 6) or rituximab alone (n = 1) (Table III). In all cases, there was a good correlation between the improvement of CG-related symptoms and variation in the mIg level. All CG-related symptoms disappeared in the two patients who achieved an apparent complete remission post-ASCT. In contrast, two other transplanted patients did not achieve a good haematological response and remained clinically symptomatic. Patients with a predominantly Fig 2.

Rituximab alone was also ineffective in the patient with IgM CG who received this treatment although there was no evidence of disease exacerbation. Repeated complete plasmatic exchanges (PE) were per- formed in 12 patients, two with an IgM CG and 10 with an IgG. Indications were severe skin necrosis in eight cases, renal manifestations in two cases and systemic presentation in another two. PE, usually performed three times a week during the first week and then progressively spaced, was used in combination with various chemo- and steroid-based regi- mens. In all cases, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical improvement, including in the two patients who pre- sented with acute kidney failure. Disease progression and complications. At diagnosis, 28 patients were not treated because they only had a few symptoms and an MGUS or indolent lymphoid disorder. With a median of follow up of 6 75 years (range: 1–20 years), the situation remained stable for 18 of these patients whereas a symptomatic MM (n = 1) or WM (n = 2) occurred in three patients. CG-related symptoms worsened in seven other patients who experienced painful necrotic pur- pura (n = 5), renal manifestations (n = 1) or both (n = 1). Fifteen patients died during follow-up. Death was a direct consequence of the underlying haemopathy in six patients including one patient who died because of cerebral vascular complications resistant to PE, corticosteroids and cyclophos- phamide. Five patients died because of infection and three as a result of lung, uterine or bladder cancers. ',\n"," 'Two, 5 and 10-year estimated overall survivals were 87% [75–93], 83% [69–90] and 68% [49–81], respectively (Fig 4). Discussion In our series, which included only cases with unambiguous typing of the CG, type I CG represented about 10% of all cases of CG that were detected in the central laboratory of a general multidisciplinary hospital. Similar rates are reported in the literature, but with large variations of between 4 6% and 38% (Brouet et al, 1974; Monti et al, 1995; Trejo et al, 2001; Rieu et al, 2002; N eel et al, 2014). Forty percent of type I CG in our series was of IgM isotype and 60% of IgG isotype. Previous series have reported a roughly similar distribution (Brouet et al, 1974; Monti et al, 1995; Trejo et al, 2001; Rieu et al, 2002; Terrier et al, 2013). Only three cases of mIgA and one of isolated LC CG have been published (Brouet et al, 1974; Gorevic et al, 1980). One of the two IgG CG that were sub-classified in the present series was IgG3, in accordance with the unexpected proportion of IgG3 that has been reported (Abraham et al, 1979) together with the tendency of this isotype to self-associate and cryoprecipitate, as confirmed in an experimental mouse model (Abdelmoula et al, 1989).

Overall survival. Type I Monoclonal Cryoglobulinaemia ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology 5 symptoms located on the extremities including Raynaud phe- nomenon, retiform or stellar purpura and skin necrosis (Bro- uet et al, 1974; Cohen et al, 1991; Trejo et al, 2001; Lipsker & Boeckler, 2007; Terrier et al, 2013). Palpable purpura related to leucocytoclastic vasculitis, which is the hallmark of mixed type II CG, is rarely observed, if ever. Painful leg ulcers, usually located in the distal part of the legs, are also frequent. Cold urticaria, observed in five of our patients, is also suggestive of CG (Rongioletti et al, 2008). Skin biopsy characteristically reveals dilated small vessels occluded by an eosinophilic, PAS positive material, associ- ated with extravasation of erythrocytes and absent or moder- ate mononuclear perivascular infiltrate. The infiltrate is taken to reflect true leucocytoclastic vasculitis in up to one-third of cases (Auzerie et al, 2003). Reactive proliferation of endothe- lial cells resembling glomeruloid reactive angioendothelioma- tosis may be observed (Fig 2), similar to patients with POEMS (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy or Oedema, M-protein and Skin abnormalities) or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes (Creamer et al, 2000). Thus, type I CG-related cutaneous symptoms are likely to be due to intravascular precipitation of the mIg triggered by cold exposure, thrombotic obstruction of the vessels and ischae- mia of the underlying skin (Della Rossa et al, 2003). This physiopathology is different from that of type II mixed CG, which is consecutive to immune complex deposits in the vas- cular walls, consumption of the main complement pathway and chemo-attraction of cells forming the peri-vascular infil- trate characteristic of true leucocytoclastic vasculitis (Feiner, 1983). Serum complement levels were abnormal in about half of our cases, probably because of complement activation by Ig aggregates rather than immune complex formation. note, however, some mIg may cryoprecipitate only when binding their specific antigen, as exemplified by one anti- ganglioside IgM (Yeni et al, 1984). Kidney involvement was reported in 20% of our patients as compared to 25% and 40% in two other series (Brouet et al, 1974; Trejo et al, 2001; N eel et al, 2014). ',\n"," 'Remarkably, renal manifestations complicate IgG type I CG much more often than IgM type I CG, which have only been previously reported in the chapter of a textbook (Koda et al, 1978). Renal lesions typically manifest as chronic glomerular disease with flares characterized by nephritic syndrome and acute kidney failure. Renal pathology shows membrano-prolifera- tive glomerulonephritis with glomerular thrombi made of the monoclonal CG (Hent et al, 1997; Galea et al, 2002; Karras et al, 2002). The presence of monotypic Ig deposits is highly suggestive of a cryoglobulinaemic kidney and their absence should put into question the diagnosis of CG. Typical glo- merular deposits made of IgM and IgG (and C3) point towards a diagnosis of type II rather than type I CG. This underlines the crucial importance of IF analysis. In addition, electron microscopy studies may be required especially when an atypical pattern is observed or when CG is undetectable in the serum (Santostefano et al, 2005). The incidence of neurological and joint manifestations varies between 5% and 30% from one series to another prob- ably because of differences in selection criteria. If performed, a nerve biopsy may show cryoglobulin deposits in the endo- neurium (Vital & Vital, 1993) or in the vasa nervorum with- out the true vasculitic perivascular cellular infiltrate that characterizes type II mixed CG-related neuropathy. Central nervous system involvement is rare (Ballouch et al, 2007; Alt- unay et al, 2012) in contrast to the ischaemic stroke that can complicate mixed type II CG due to HCV. Joint manifesta- tions may be associated with fever, impaired general condi- tion and necrotic skin lesions and patients presenting with these symptoms should be tested for crystal-CG, which usu- ally involves an mIgG3 (Rengers et al, 2000). Interestingly, CG crystals are identified in the synovium of involved joints demonstrating that joint involvement is consecutive to gout- like micro-crystalline arthropathy (Aarset et al, 2002). In contrast to the sometimes life-threatening manifestations, type I CG can also be asymptomatic. Of note, six of our asymp- tomatic or nearly asymptomatic patients had very high or mas- sive serum cryoglobulinlevels and, conversely,five patients with seriouscomplicationshadlowcryoglobulin.Theclinicalseverity of type I CG is more likely to be linked to the temperature at which precipitation occurs, which is not the case in type II CG where symptoms are more orthostatic rather than cold-related (Gorevic et al, 1980). ',\n"," 'In our asymptomatic patients, type I CG was sometimes discovered because of the incidental finding of a precipitate in a serum sample or of amorphous crystals in a bloodsmear,aspreviouslyreported(Shiratoet al,2009).Intwo cases it was discovered during the work-up for a CAD, where the monoclonal cold agglutinin IgM can also precipitate at a lowtemperature(Pujolet al,1998;Ciejkaet al,1999). Regardless of how type I CG is initially detected, the implications are the same as for any mIg, i.e. exploration should be conducted for an underlying haematological disor- der, which may be characterized sometimes years after dis- covering the CG. There are only a few publications regarding the manage- ment of type I CG. All patients should carefully avoid expo- sure to the cold and take appropriate protective measures. Aspirin antiplatelet, or even anticoagulation therapy, could be administered if cutaneous necrosis or livedo reticularis is present, although it has not been proved to be effective. However, most investigators would agree that regular moni- toring alone is sufficient for patients with few CG-related symptoms. The risk of developing an overt lympho€ıd disor- der or cryo-related complications outlines the importance of regular follow-up and may argue in favour of incorporating routine CG screening in the case of any mIg or of B-cell lymphoid proliferation. When CG-related symptoms are severe, complete PE is indicated, even though no prospective studies have established their efficacy or optimal use (Shaw et al, 1985; Della Rossa et al, 2003; Vila et al, 2004; Rockx & Clark, 2010). Otherwise, in patients with symptomatic and/or pro- Harel et al 6 ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology gressive disease, targeting the underlying B-cell clone is the main therapeutic option. Here, the key point is to adapt treatment modalities to the nature of the underlying gamm- opathy. If it is plasmacytic (i.e. mainly composed of CD20 negative cells and usually secreting an mIgG), the treatment should be based on anti-myeloma agents (Sampson & Callen, 2006; Talamo et al, 2008; Spizzo et al, 2010; Calabrese et al, 2011) including, in selected young patients with severe dis- ease, HDM with ASCT. If the underlying B-cell disorder is lympho-plasmacytic, usually associated with an mIgM, the treatment should be as for WM (Dimopoulos et al, 2009). As renal function is frequently altered in symptomatic patients, a combination of high dose steroids and cyclophos- phamide was previously the reference treatment of type I CG. ',\n"," 'Therapeutic options now include bortezomib, IMiDs (particularly thalidomide, which is not eliminated by the kid- ney) and bendamustine. Rituximab, the therapeutic interest of which is well-established in mixed type II CG (Zaja et al, 2003; Terrier et al, 2010), was effective in five of the seven reported patients with type I CG (Nehme-Schuster et al, 2005; Pandrangi et al, 2008; Shaikh et al, 2008; Akiyama et al, 2011; Wink et al, 2011). Only one of these responders had an IgG CG. Similarly, rituximab was effective in only one of our five IgG MM or MGUS patients who received this treatment. Thus, patients with a predominantly plasmacytic underlying B-cell proliferation do not appear to benefit from a treatment that might be thought to act on plasma cell pre- cursors. Rituximab should therefore only be used when the secreting B-cell clone is demonstrated to be CD20-positive or is likely to be so. Of note, its administration may be followed by a transient disease exacerbation (Nehme-Schuster et al, 2005), similar to the so-called flare that may occur in WM or in hepatitis C-associated type II CG (S ene et al, 2009). In conclusion, the present series confirms that the distinc- tion between type I and type II CG, that was made nearly 40 years ago, remains fully relevant. Indeed, both situations are different from clinical, histological and physico-patholog- ical points of view and require different therapeutic approaches. In addition, the present series shows that type I IgG and IgM CG are associated with different clinical mani- festations and require ‘personalized’ treatment according to the disease characteristics and based on the underlying hae- matological disorder.

This international phase 3 study compared the  effi cacy and tolerance of the standard therapy with a potentially less toxic combination consisting of bendamustine  and rituximab. Methods Treatment-naive fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (aged 33–81 years) without del(17p) were  enrolled after undergoing a central screening process. ',\n"," 'Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a computer-generated  randomisation list using randomly permuted blocks with a block size of eight and were stratifi ed according to  participating country and Binet stage. Patients were allocated to receive six cycles of intravenous fl udarabine (25 mg/m²  per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m² per day) for the fi rst 3 days or to intravenous bendamustine (90 mg/m²  per day) for the fi rst 2 days of each cycle. Rituximab 375 mg/m² was given intravenously in both groups on day 0 of  cycle 1 and subsequently was given at 500 mg/m² during the next fi ve cycles on day 1. The primary endpoint was  progression-free survival with the objective to assess non-inferiority of bendamustine and rituximab to the standard  therapy. We aimed to show that the 2-year progression-free survival with bendamustine and rituximab was not 67·5%  or less with a corresponding non-inferiority margin of 1·388 for the hazard ratio (HR) based on the 90·4% CI. The fi nal  analysis was done by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00769522. Findings 688 patients were recruited between Oct 2, 2008, and July 11, 2011, of which 564 patients who met inclusion  criteria were  randomly assigned. 561 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population: 282 patients in the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group and 279 in the bendamustine and rituximab group. After a median  observation time of 37·1 months (IQR 31·0–45·5) median progression-free survival was 41·7 months (95% CI  34·9–45·3) with bendamustine and rituximab and 55·2 months (95% CI not evaluable) with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (HR 1·643, 90·4% CI 1·308–2·064). As the upper limit of the 90·4% CI was greater  than 1·388 the null hypothesis for the corresponding non-inferiority hypothesis was not rejected. Severe neutropenia  and infections were more frequently observed with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (235 [84%] of 279 vs  164 [59%] of 278, and 109 [39%] vs 69 [25%], respectively) during the study. The increased frequency of infectious  complications with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab was more pronounced in patients older than 65 years. ',\n"," 'in patients older than 65 years. Interpretation The combination of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the standard front-line  therapy in fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but bendamustine and rituximab is associated with less  toxic eff ects.

Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the most common  leukaemia in high-income countries, had been considered  as incurable by conventional therapies.1 In general,  younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  have a reduced life expectancy.1 The introduction of  antibody-based chemo immunotherapy has improved the  outcome of younger patients by inducing long-lasting and  possibly durable remissions with a median progression- free survival of up to 80 months in subgroups of patients.2–4  Following the results of a phase 2 study by the MD  Anderson Cancer Center2 and a phase 3 study by the  German CLL Group, the CLL8 study,5 fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab have become the  Articles 2 www.thelancet.com/oncology Published online May 20, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30051-1 Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark  (T Plesner MD); First  Department of Medicine,  Charles University General  Hospital, Prague, Czech  Republic (Prof M Trneny MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine III, University of Ulm,  Ulm, Germany  (Prof H Döhner MD,  Prof S Stilgenbauer MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine II, University Hospital  of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus  Kiel, Kiel, Germany  (Prof M Kneba MD,  S Böttcher MD); Department I  of Internal Medicine, Klinikum  Schwabing, Munich, Germany  (Prof C-M Wendtner MD);  Haematopathology Section  and Lymph Node Registry,  Department of Pathology,  University of Kiel, Kiel,  Germany (Prof W Klapper MD);  and Cluster of Excellence on  Cellular Stress Responses in  Aging (CECAD), University of  Cologne, Cologne, Germany  (Prof M Hallek) Correspondence to: Dr Barbara Eichhorst, Department  I of Internal Medicine and Center  of Integrated Oncology Köln  Bonn, University of Cologne,  Cologne, Germany barbara.eichhorst@uk-koeln.de standard front-line therapy for physically fi t patients with  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, this regimen is  associated with substantial toxic eff ects, most importantly  severe haematotoxicity in 56% of patients and severe  infections in 25% of patients during treatment. ',\n"," 'A long- term follow-up of patients treated with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab showed prolonged  neutropenia in 17–35% and an elevated risk of secondary  neoplasia.4,6,7 The combination of the alkylating agent bendamustine  and rituximab has shown promising results in a phase 2  study in front-line therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  with overall responses in 103 (88%) of 117 patients and  complete responses in 27 (23%) of 117 patients.8 Event-free  survival of 34 months and low incidence of severe  neutropenia (20%) and infections (8%) led to the hypothesis  that front-line treatment with bendamustine and rituximab  might be similarly eff ective but less toxic compared with the  standard treatment. Therefore, the German CLL Study Group did an  international phase 3 study to test the non-inferiority of  bendamustine and rituximab versus fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in front-line therapy of  fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but  without del(17p). Methods  Study design and participants We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority  study in previously untreated fi t patients aged 33–81 years  with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who  required treatment according to the International  Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)  criteria9 and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) status of 0–2. Treatment-naive patients diagnosed with chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia were registered for central  screening, which was done by the German CLL Study  Group central study offi ce (Cologne, Germany) and  included immunophenotyping for confi rmation of the  diagnosis, fl uorescence-in-situ hybridisation (FISH) to  determine del(17p) status, evaluation of the comorbidity  burden, and renal function. Samples for central  immunophenotyping and FISH were assessed at the  reference laboratories (Department I for Internal  Medicine, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany and  the Department of Internal Medicine III, University of  Ulm, Germany, respectively). Patients with del(17p) as  detected by FISH were excluded. Patients had to have an  advanced clinical stage (Binet C) or confi rmed active  disease requiring treatment.9 Moreover, a low comorbidity  burden as defi ned by a Cumulative Illness Rating Scale  (CIRS)10 score up to 6, a normal creatinine clearance of at  least 70 mL/min, and an ECOG performance status of  0–2 were required for inclusion. ',\n"," 'Patients with impaired  renal function due to an abdominal lymph node mass  were eligible after central review. The main exclusion  criteria were impaired renal function other than that  caused by abdominal lymph node mass, CIRS score less  than 6, previous therapy for chronic lymphocytic  Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed between April 1, 2007, and Jan 31, 2008  for reports with the search terms “CLL”, and “clinical trial” and  “chemotherapy” and “antibody” without date or language  restrictions. Publications showed promising results for  chemoimmunotherapy regimens based on purine analogues  with or without CD20 antibodies or with the CD52 antibody  alemtuzumab. First data from the CLL8 study of the German CLL  Study Group presented at the American Society of Hematology  Meeting in December, 2007, showed the superiority of the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab regimen over  chemotherapy alone. On the other hand, all purine  analogue-based combinations were associated with toxic  eff ects. First data from a phase 2 trial evaluating bendamustine  and rituximab had favourable results with regard to toxic eff ects  and good effi cacy. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health  registry for clinical trials listed no clinical trials with a head-to- head comparison of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab with bendamustine and rituximab in chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia. Added value of this study The CLL10 study is the fi rst trial directly comparing  bendamustine-based chemoimmunotherapy with fl udarabine  and cyclophosphamide-based chemoimmunotherapy. The data  confi rm data from a meta-analysis suggesting the superiority  of fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide-based  chemoimmunotherapy over bendamustine-based  chemoimmunotherapy. Implications of all the available evidence In a head-to-head comparison bendamustine and rituximab is  less eff ective than the standard therapy, but can be considered  in patients older than 65 years with chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia. Higher incidence of adverse events observed with  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in patients  older than 65 years and good effi cacy with bendamustine and  rituximab in this group might support the use of  bendamustine and rituximab in fi t elderly patients. Moreover,  our data show that immunosuppressive eff ects are long  lasting with fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide-based  therapy.

All patients provided written informed consent  before central screening was begun. The study was done  according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Randomisation and masking After the central screening process, eligible patients  were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer- generated randomisation list (Institute for Medical  Statistics and Epidemiology, Technical University of  Munich, Germany). The randomisation was balanced by  the use of randomly permuted blocks with a block size  of eight and was stratifi ed according to participating  country and Binet stage at pre-therapeutic staging (A vs  B vs C). The assigned treatment group was provided to  the German CLL Study Group central study offi ce, and  the screening result together with the confi rmation of  patient randomisation, and allocation to treatment were  sent through the German CLL Study Group central  study offi ce to the investigators. Investigators and  patients were not masked to the treatment assignment. Procedures Within the two-group parallel design of this investigator- initiated trial, six cycles of rituximab-based chemo- immunotherapy with fl udarabine and cyclo phosphamide  were compared with six cycles of bendamustine and  rituximab. The standard treatment consisted of  six 28-day cycles of intravenous fl udarabine (25 mg/m²  per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m²  per day)  on the fi rst 3 days of each cycle. The treatment  with bendamustine (90 mg/m² per day) was given  intravenously on the fi rst 2 days of each of the six 28-day  cycles. Rituximab 375 mg/m² was given to both groups  intravenously on day 0 of cycle 1 and subsequently  during the next fi ve cycles rituximab 500 mg/m² was  given on day 1 of each cycle. According to the protocol,  prophylactic use of antibiotics or growth factors was  not generally recommended. In cases of severe  leukocytopenia with a duration of more than 7 days,  prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with  co-trimoxazole was recommended. ',\n"," 'In patients whose blood counts had not recovered  adequately within 28 days or still showed signs of an  active infection, the next treatment was postponed and  further cycles of therapy continued with a 25% dose  reduction. After two dose reductions to a total dose  reduction of 50%, treatment was stopped in case there  was any further treatment delay due to adverse events. Baseline disease assessment included physical  examination, ECOG performance status, and imaging  with CT scans or ultrasound. IGHV mutation status  was analysed by DNA sequencing at the reference  laboratory (Department of Internal Medicine III,  University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). During treatment,  blood counts (leucocytes, haemoglobin, thrombocytes,  and diff erential blood count of leucocytes) were  measured on a weekly basis, and serum chemistry  (creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, AST, and  ALT) at least once before the next treatment cycle. Response to treatment was classifi ed according to the  IWCLL response criteria.9 Radiographic imaging and  blood counts were done at fi nal restaging (ie, 3 months  after the beginning of the last treatment cycle). Response  and disease progression were assessed by the study  investigators and confi rmed by a central, investigator- independent medical review. Minimal residual disease  status was examined centrally in the reference laboratory  (Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital  of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany), as  previously described.11 For minimal residual disease  status samples of peripheral blood were assessed by  four-colour minimal residual disease status fl ow  cytometry with a sensitivity of at least 10–4 at study entry,  at interim staging, and for fi nal staging in all patients. Infections of any grade and all severe adverse events  were reported up to 5 years after treatment. Each adverse  event was reported with severity rated in accordance with  the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) criteria (version 3) grades. An interim assessment was done after three cycles of  treatment. Patients who achieved a complete response,  partial response, or stable disease, and in whom toxic  eff ects were acceptable, continued treatment for three  additional cycles. Patients with progressive disease  stopped treatment and were treated outside the study  protocol at the discretion of the treating physician. ',\n"," 'Patients with progressive disease were assessed as non- responders. An assessment of initial response was done  1 month (within 7 days) after the beginning of the last  cycle of treatment. The results were confi rmed 2 months  later by fi nal restaging, which had to be done in all  patients receiving at least two treatment cycles. Subsequently, patients completed follow-up examination  every 3 months for the fi rst 2 years and every 6 months  for the next 3 years. Thereafter, the disease status was  assessed annually. Measurement for the presence of  minimal residual disease cells in the bone marrow  during fi nal restaging was planned for all patients who  achieved a clinical complete remission at the initial  response assessment. For patients with clinical complete  response at fi nal restaging, a peripheral blood minimal  residual disease status analysis at 12 and 18 months after  fi nal restaging was done. Outcomes The primary objective of this study was to show non- inferiority of bendamustine and rituximab compared  with the standard treatment of fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab with regard to a  primary endpoint of progression-free survival, defi ned  as time from randomisation until progression or death  Articles 4 www.thelancet.com/oncology Published online May 20, 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30051-1 from any cause. ',\n"," 'Progression was assessed by the  site investigators and had a systematic investigator- independent medical review based on the IWCLL  criteria (progression had to be centrally confi rmed  before being accepted).9 Secondary endpoints were:  overall survival (defi ned as time between randomisation  until death from any cause); the proportion of patients  who achieved an overall response (defi ned as proportion  of patients having achieved a complete remission,  complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery,  or partial remission as response to study treatment with  respect to the intention-to-treat population); minimal  residual disease status assessment; the proportion of  patients achieving a response in biologically defi ned  risk groups (according to age, sex, Binet stage, IGHV  status, and cytogenetic subgroup according to the  hierarchical model); safety; event-free survival (defi ned  as time from fi rst study treatment to date of the  beginning of a new treatment for any haematological  maliganancy, disease progression, or death from any  cause); duration of remission (defi ned as the time  between date of fi rst response until progression or  death from any cause); and quality of life assessment  using the EORTC-C30, including the fatigue module. Statistical analysis The primary endpoint of progression-free survival was  used to calculate the sample size of the study. The non- inferiority hypothesis of bendamustine and rituximab  compared with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab was tested by assessing whether the 90·4% CI  of the hazard ratio (HR) excluded a predefi ned  non-inferiority margin including the adjustment for  one interim analysis using the O’Brien and Fleming  method. Based on results from the CLL8 trial5 and the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab trial of the  MD Anderson Cancer Center2 it was assumed that  treatment with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab would lead to a 75·0% progression-free survival  at 2 years. We aimed to show that the 2-year progression- free survival with bendamustine and rituximab was not  67·5% or less with a corresponding non-inferiority  margin of 1·388 for the HR. 198 progression-free survival  events were required to have 80% power (alpha was  0·048, one sided). 511 patients needed to be enrolled with  these assumptions. Due to an expected drop-out rate of  10%, we aimed to recruit 550 patients. ',\n"," 'The interim  analysis was done after two-thirds (ie, 132) of the required  progression-free survival events. For the primary  endpoint analysis the HR including the 90·4% CI was  calculated with a multivariable Cox regression analysis  under the assumption of proportional hazards adjusted  for the stratifi cation factors Binet stage and country. In a  second step, a Cox proportional-hazards model with both  stepwise forward and backward selection procedures was  applied to progression-free survival, including treatment,  country, Binet stage, and other prognostic factors, such as  Figure 1: Trial profi le CLL=chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Further sensitivity  analyses were not done for the primary endpoint analysis. Time-to-event endpoints including 95% CIs were  estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and  survival curves were compared using two-sided non- stratifi ed log-rank tests. For comparison of the treatment  groups, Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s χ² test  (categorical variables) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test  (continuous variables) were used. Exploratory post hoc  subgroup analyses for progression-free survival and  response were done considering the factors age, Binet  stage, cytogenetic categories, IGHV mutation status,  and sex. Methods included two-sided non-stratifi ed log- rank tests and the calculation of HRs including 95% CIs. Additionally, the interaction with study treatment was  explored for each factor; a term for the interaction  between the factor and the study treatment was included  in a Cox regression model. Post hoc matched paired  analysis was done for IGHV mutation status and  progression-free survvial (appendix). All statistical tests were two-sided and a p value of less  than 0·05 was considered signifi cant. Adjustments for  multiple comparisons were not considered for analysing  secondary endpoints and exploratory subgroup analyses. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat  population. The results of minimal residual disease  status at follow-up were calculated based on the intention- to-treat population and based on those patients for whom  a sample at follow-up month 12 and month 18 was  available. Safety analyses were restricted to patients from the  intention-to-treat population who received at least one  dose of one component of the study treatment.

After central screening, 124 patients  were not eligible for trial participation. 564 patients  (aged 33–81 years) who met the inclusion criteria were  randomly assigned to the treatment groups (fi gure 1). Three patients were excluded immediately after allocation  due to major violation of the inclusion and exclusion  criteria resulting in 282 patients included in the  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group  and 279 in the bendamustine and rituximab group  (the intention-to-treat population; fi gure 1). Both treatment  groups were well balanced with respect to disease stage,  median age, sex, time from initial diagnosis, physical  fi tness (CIRS, ECOG status), creatinine clearance,  presence of B-symptoms, serum concentration of  β2-microglobulin and thymidine kinase, and genomic  aberrations according to the hierarchical model and  detected by FISH (table 1). However, there was an  imbalance in the distribution of patients with unmutated  IGHV status with a higher proportion in the bendamustine  and rituximab group. Moreover, the proportion of patients  older than 70 years was higher in the bendamustine and  rituximab group than the fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab group. Among female patients there was an  imbalance in the distribuation of del(11q) between both  groups (triple combination, 21 [26%] of 81 had del(11q),  double combination, 11 [15%] of 72). The median follow-up  for the fl udarabine, cyclophos phamide, and rituximab  group was 37·4 months (IQR 31·7–46·4) and for the  bendamustine and rituximab group was 36·0 months  (30·6–44·7) (for all patients 37·1 months [IQR 31·0–45·5]). The median number of treatment cycles was  six (triple combination IQR 5–6, double combination 6–6)  for both groups (mean number for fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab 5·27 [SD 1·33], for  bendamustine and rituximab 5·41 [1·35]; p=0·02).  83 (29%) of 282 patients in the fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab group compared with  54 (19%) of 279 patients in the bendamustine and  rituximab group received less than the planned six cycles  of treatment (p=0·005).

Reasons for early treatment discontinuation in  the triple combination group were toxic eff ects in  26 patients, progressive disease in two patients, patient  decision for six patients, and three patients went off study  before start of treatment, and in the double combination  group, toxic eff ects in 24 patients, progressive disease in  two patients, patient decision for four patients, one patient  achieved a complete response, and one patient went off  study before start of treatment. For any of the three drugs a dose reduction of more  than 10% was done during at least one treatment cycle in  148 (52%) of 282 patients of the fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab group and in 145 (52%) of  279 patients of the bendamustine and rituximab group  (p=0·904). ',\n"," 'No signifi cant diff erence for dose reduction  was observed between the two age groups. Of the patients  aged 65 years or younger, 108 (55%) received at least one  cycle of a dose-reduced fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab regimen and 85 (50%) at least one cycle of  a dose-reduced bendamustine and rituximab regimen  (p=0·302). In patients older than 65 years, bendamustine  and rituximab was dose reduced in 60 (56%) patients  and fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in  40 (47%; p=0·211). Overall, a signifi cantly higher  proportion of treatment cycles with bendamustine and  rituximab were dose reduced by more than 10% (423 [28%]  of 1510 cycles) than with fl udarabine, cyclo phosphamide,  and rituximab (363 [24%] of 1487 cycles; p=0·025). No diff erences in dose reductions were observed between  male and female patients in the fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group (41 [51%] of  81 female patients and 107 [53%] of 201 male patients;  p=0·69) or the bendamustine and rituximab groups  (34 [47%] of 72 female patients and 111 (54%) of 207 male  patients; p=0·35). Progression-free survival was signifi cantly shorter for  bendamustine and rituximab in comparison with  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (median  41·7 months [95% CI 34·9–45·3] vs 55·2 months [not  evaluable], HR 1·643 [90·4% CI 1·308–2·064] p=0·0003;  fi gure 2). As the upper limit of the 90·4% CI was greater  than 1·388 the null hypothesis for the corresponding non- inferiority hypothesis was not rejected. Treatment with  bendamustine and rituximab, elevated serum thymidine  kinase, del(11q), and unmutated IGHV status were  independently associated with a higher risk of progression  in multivariate analysis (table 2). The results of the  univariate analysis are in the appendix. In younger patients (≤65 years) median progression- free survival was signifi cantly longer with the triple  combination (53·6 months [95% CI not evaluable]) than  with the double combination (38·5 months [33·1–44·8],  p=0·0004; fi gures 2, 3). There was no signifi cant  diff erence in progression-free survival in elderly  (>65 years) patients in the fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab treated group compared with the  bendamustine and rituximab group (median not reached  [95% CI not evaluable] vs 48·5 months [34·6–52·0];  p=0·172; fi gure 2). ',\n"," 'There was no signifi cant interaction  between study treatment and age (p=0·413). Post-hoc  assessment of progression-free survival according to  IGHV status showed a median time to progression of  42·7 months (95% CI 36·2–55·2) in the fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab therapy group versus  33·6 months (30·3–38·4) in the bendamustine and  rituximab group for patients with unmutated IGHV  status (p=0·017; fi gures 2, 3).

Post-hoc  subgroup analysis according to sex showed no diff erence  in progression-free survival between treatment groups  for women (fi gure 3). In female patients median  progression-free survival was 51·5 months (95% CI not  evaluable) with the triple combination therapy and  52·0 months (not evaluable) with the bendamustine and  rituximab therapy (p=0·916), by contrast with male  patients, in whom progression-free survival was not  reached (95% CI not evaluable) versus 35·3 months  (33·5–42·6, p<0·0001; fi gure 3, appendix). Moreover,  there was a signifi cant interaction between study  treatment and sex (p=0·034). Post-hoc anlaysis showed  that fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  treatment resulted in a signifi cantly longer progression- free survival in the genetic subgroup of patients with  del(11q) (37·8 months [95% CI 31·5–45·5] vs 25·3 months  [23·5–30·3], p=0·0002; fi gure 3). In all other genetic  subgroups the diff erence in progression-free survival  was not signifi cant and did not have any interactions  with study treatment (fi gure 3, appendix).

Signifi cantly more patients treated with  the triple combination had negative minimal residual  disease (137 [49%, 74% referring to available samples  only]) in comparison with patients treated with  bendamustine and rituximab (107 [38%, 63% referring  to available samples only]; p=0·041, and p=0·029 for  available samples, respectively). ',\n"," 'Bone marrow samples  were evaluated in 129 (46%) patients after fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab treatment and  98 (35%) patients after bendamustine and rituximab  treatment. Negative minimal residual disease in bone  marrow was achieved in 75 patients (27%, 58% referring  to available samples only) after fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab and 31 patients (11%, 32%  referring to available samples only; both comparisons  p<0·0001) after bendamustine and rituximab. During  follow-up at month 12, 80 patients (67 patients at month  18) after fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  therapy and 78 patients (59 patients at month 18) after  bendamustine and rituximab therapy were assessed for  minimal residual disease in peripheral blood. Minimal  residual disease was not detected in a signifi cantly  higher proportion of patients treated with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab compared with those  treated with bendamustine and rituximab after  12 months (referring to available samples 47 [59%] vs  20 [26%], p<0·0001; referring to all patients 17% vs 7%,  p=0·0001) and after 18 months (37 [55%] vs 16 [27%],  p=0·002; 13% vs 6%, p=0·005, respectively). No diff erence in overall survival was observed between  treatment groups. After 3 years, 91% (95% CI 87·0–94·2)  of the patients treated with fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab and 92% [88·7–95·6] of  those treated with bendamustine and rituximab were  still alive (HR 1·034 [95% CI 0·620–1·724], p=0·897;  fi gure 4). 30 patients assigned to triple combination  therapy and 29 patients assigned to bendamustine and  rituximab therapy had died as of January, 2014. In most  patients, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was the  cause of death (ten [33%] of 30 with fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab and 12 [41%] of  29 with bendamustine and rituximab). Secondary  cancers (seven [23%] with fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab and fi ve [17%] with  bendamustine and rituximab) were the second most  frequent cause followed by death due to other  diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (fi ve [17%]  with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  and seven [24%] with bendamustine and rituximab). ',\n"," 'Other causes of death included: in the fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group, one liver  failure due to cirrhosis, one death due to graft-versus- host disease, one death due to intra-abdominal bleeding  with anticoagulants, one death with no autopsy  performed; and in the bendamustine and rituximab  group, one lung embolism. Due to the low number of  deaths, subgroup analyses were not done. Event-free survival analysis and duration of response  data are shown in the appendix. Duration of response was  signifi cantly longer with the triple combination than with  the double combination (52·7 months [95% CI not  evaluable] vs 38·9 months [34·2–43·6]; HR 1·657  [95% CI 1·256–2·185]; p=0·001). Median event- free survival was 55·2 months (95% CI not evaluable) with  the triple combination and 38·5 months (32·4–44·6)  with bendamustine and rituximab (HR 1·626  [95% CI 1·255–2·108]; p=0·001). As of data cutoff , 12 (4%)  patients in the fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab group and 18 (6%) patients in the bendamustine  and rituximab group only have received treatment for  relapse (appendix). Four patients from each group had an  allogeneic stem cell transplant. All 557 patients who received at least one dose of study  treatment were included in the safety analysis. Severe,  CTCAE grade 3 and 4, adverse events occurred more  frequently in the fl udarabine, cyclo phosphamide, and  rituximab group compared with the bendamustine and  rituximab group (table 4). Neutropenia, leukocytopenia,  thrombocytopenia, and the incidence of severe infec- tions were more frequent with the triple combination  therapy.

(Blood.2016;127(2):208-215) Introduction Currently,thereremainsageneralconsensusthatnocurativetreatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exists with the exception of allogeneicstemcelltransplantation. Chemoimmunotherapyachieves disease control and survival prolongation and is therefore the current standardtreatmentinpatientswithpreviouslyuntreatedCLL. 2-5 Inthe last 5 years, 2 new drugs, ibrutinib and idelalisib, targeting B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, have been studied and approved. They are less toxic in the short term than chemotherapeutic agents and yielded promisingresponsesinpatientswithrelapsed/refractoryCLLincluding those with a TP53 aberration. 6-11 Furthermore, the selective BCL-2 inhibitorvenetoclaxiscurrentlybeinginvestigatedinongoingclinical trials. Given these results, it is likely that the place of first-line chemoimmunotherapy may be challenged in the future. ',\n"," 'Importantly, the experience with these new drugs remains limited, and the current treatment model requires continuous indefinite treatment. Moreover,thereisalackofprospective,controlledtrialswiththese agents in the first-line setting. Additionally, although the out- come following chemoimmunotherapy may be highly variable, important subgroups of patients show an excellent outcome, cor- roboratingitsuseasstandardfirst-linetherapy.Ontheotherhand, secondary malignancies are one of the most concerning unwanted effects following chemoimmunotherapy, and the true long-term incidence needs to be better defined.

On the basis of these findings, FCR has becomethestandardtherapyforphysicallyfitpatientswithpreviously untreated CLL. In this report, we present the results of an extended observation time with a median follow-up of 5.9 years of the randomized phase 3 CLL8 trial of the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), with particular emphasis on long-term follow-up for survival and adverse events. Methods Study design Thestudydesign hasbeenreportedpreviously. Inshort, the CLL8trialwasa prospective, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study conducted at 190 centers across11countries.TheInstitutionalReviewBoardand/orethicscommitteeof each institution approved the study protocol. Each patient provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Study treatment consisted of 6 courses (28days/course)ofintravenousF(25mg/m perday)andC(250mg/m perday) for the first 3 days of each treatment course, with or without the addition of rituximab. Rituximab (Mabthera/Rituxan; F.

Methods Treatment-naive, physically fi t patients (aged 30–81 years) with CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fl udarabine (25 mg/m2 per day)  and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2 per day) for the fi rst 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without  rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 0 of fi rst course, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of second to sixth courses) in 190 centres in  11 countries. Investigators and patients were not masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The  primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00281918. Findings 408 patients were assigned to fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy group)  and 409 to fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy group); all patients were analysed. At 3 years after  randomisation, 65% of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were free of progression compared with 45% in  the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·56 [95% CI 0·46–0·69], p<0·0001); 87% were alive versus 83%, respectively  (0·67 [0·48–0·92]; p=0·01). Chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia  (136 [34%] of 404 vs 83 [21%] of 396; p<0·0001) and leucocytopenia (97 [24%] vs 48 [12%]; p<0·0001). Other side- eff ects, including severe infections, were not increased. There were eight (2%) treatment-related deaths in the  chemoimmunotherapy group compared with ten (3%) in the chemotherapy group. Interpretation Chemoimmunotherapy with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab improves progression- free survival and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Moreover, the results suggest that  the choice of a specifi c fi rst-line treatment changes the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Funding F Hoff mann-La Roche. Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common  adult lymphoid malignant disease in western countries,  aff ecting about fi ve in 100 000 of the population per  year.1,2 Its clinical course is highly variable and can be  predicted by use of various criteria,3 including clinical  staging,4,5 chromosomal abnormalities,6 or mutations  of the immunoglobulin heavy variable chain  (IGHV) gene.7,8 For more than 40 years, chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia has been treated with various chemotherapies. ',\n"," 'Chlorambucil, an alkylating drug, was the main drug  for three decades.9,10 Combinations of alkylating drugs  with vinca alkaloids or anthracycline drugs did not  improve outcomes.11 In the 1990s, purine analogues  were a new class of drugs that were active against  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.12,13 In the past decade,  the combination of purine analogues with alkylating  drugs, particularly fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide,  improved the rates of clinical response, complete  remission, and progression-free survival (PFS).14–16 Until  now, however, none of these drug combinations have  shown an improvement in overall survival in  clinical studies. Chemoimmunotherapy—the addition of monoclonal  antibodies to chemotherapy—was created for the  treatment of indolent and aggressive lymphoma. ',\n"," 'Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed  against the CD20 antigen,17 became the standard drug  for use with chemotherapy for various B-cell  lymphomas.18,19 In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,  however, the low expression of the CD20 antigen on  leukaemic cells,20,21 and poor response rates with  standard-dose rituximab led to the initial expectation  that rituximab might not generate suffi cient clinical  benefi t in this disease.22 However, higher doses of  Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 376 October 2, 2010 1165 and University of Melbourne,  Melbourne, VIC, Australia  (Prof J F Seymour MD);  Haematology Institute, Kaplan  Medical Centre, Rehovot, Israel  (Prof A Berrebi MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine I, Division of  Haematology and  Haemostaseology, Medical  University of Vienna, Vienna,  Austria (Prof U Jäger MD);  Service des Maladies du Sang,  Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille,  France (B Cazin MD); First  Department of Medicine,  Charles University General  Hospital, Prague, Czech  Republic (M Trneny MD); Klinik  für Hämatologie und  Onkologie, St Antonius  Hospital, Eschweiler, Germany  (P Staib MD); Department of  Internal Medicine III, University  of Ulm, Ulm, Germany  (A Bühler MD, D Winkler MD,  T Zenz MD, Prof H Döhner MD,  Prof S Stilgenbauer MD);  Department of Internal  Medicine II, University Hospital  of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus  Kiel, Kiel, Germany  (S Böttcher MD, M Ritgen MD,  Prof M Kneba MD); and  rituximab used alone improved response rates.23  Moreover, the results of phase 2 trials suggested that  rituximab in combination with chemotherapy might  have additive or synergistic eff ects in pretreated and  treatment-naive patients.24–28 In these trials, the standard  dose of rituximab (375 mg/m2 per day) was increased to  500 mg/m2 per day.24 In a study of 300 treatment-naive  patients, the combination of fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab resulted in an overall  response rate of 95%, with 72% of patients achieving a  complete response.24,28 These response rates were among  the highest reported so far for fi rst-line treatments in  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. ',\n"," 'On the  basis of these promising results, the German Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukaemia Study Group initiated a phase 3  study to compare the effi cacy and safety of fl udarabine  and cyclophosphamide with fl udarabine, cyclo- phosphamide, and rituximab as fi rst-line treatment in  patients with advanced, symptomatic chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods Study design and patients A prospective, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study  was done in 190 centres in 11 countries. Treatment-naive  patients (aged 30–81 years) diagnosed with  immunophenotypically confi rmed chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia in Binet stage C,4 or with confi rmed active  disease in Binet stages A or B29 were enrolled  (webappendix p 1). Additional inclusion criteria were an  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)  performance status of 0–1 and a low comorbidity, which  was defi ned as a cumulative illness rating scale30 of up  to 6, and a creatinine clearance of at least 1·17 mL/s  (webappendix p 1). The main exclusion criteria were the  absence of active disease in patients with Binet stage A  or B, and the presence of clinically apparent autoimmune  cytopenia or active second disease. The institutional review board or ethics committee of  each institution approved the study protocol. Each  patient provided written informed consent before  enrolment. Randomisation and masking After informed consent was obtained from the patients,  investigators faxed the required registration sheets to  the central study offi ce in Cologne, Germany. Patients  were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio in a block  size of four to receive fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide  (chemotherapy) or fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy) up to July 27, 2004,  stratifi ed by centre, and then by country and Binet stage  since the fi rst amendment (July 27, 2004), using a  randomisation list that was computer generated at the  Institute for Medical Statistics and Epidemiology,  Technical University of Munich, Germany. Confi rmation  of patient randomisation and allocation to treatment  group was sent through the Central Study Offi ce in  Cologne, Germany, to the investigators. Patients were  enrolled by the investigators, and assignment to  treatment was done centrally at the Institute for Medical  Statistics and Epidemiology, Technical University of  Munich. Thus, patient allocation was done independently  of the study investigators. ',\n"," 'Investigators and patients  were not masked to the treatment assignment. Procedures Treatment consisted of six 28-day courses of intravenous  fl udarabine (25 mg/m2 per day) and cyclophosphamide  (250 mg/m2 per day) for the fi rst 3 days of each treatment  course, with or without rituximab (Mabthera or Rituxan,  Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on day 0 of the fi rst course, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of  the second to sixth courses. Prophylaxis with antiviral  drugs or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor were not  recommended in this study (webappendix p 1). Prophylaxis of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis  jirovecii was recommended for severe leucocytopenia  that lasted for more than 7 days. An interim response assessment was done after three  courses of treatment. Patients who achieved at least a  partial response or complete remission continued  treatment as planned in the protocol.

Subsequently, patients  completed follow-up examinations every 3 months for  the following years 1–3, every 6 months for years 4–5,  and every year up to year 8. Assessments of clinical disease were completed at  baseline, including assessments of tumour, cumulative  illness rating scale, ECOG performance status, and  immunophenotyping of circulating lymphocytes. ',\n"," 'Analyses of genomic aberrations by use of fl uorescent  in-situ hybridisation (FISH),6 and IGHV mutation  status7,8 by use of DNA sequencing were done in the  central reference laboratory (Ulm, Germany). Response to treatment and disease progression were  classifi ed according to the National Cancer Institute’s  working group criteria of 1996.29 Responses and disease  progression were assessed by the study investigators  and verifi ed by a central, investigator-independent  medical review. Adverse events and serious adverse  events were documented according to the Common  Toxicity Criteria (version 2). In January, 2008, the preplanned interim analysis  showed a signifi cant diff erence in the primary effi cacy  analysis (PFS) in favour of the group assigned to  chemoimmunotherapy. Since the signifi cance exceeded  the threshold for early closure, the study was formally  ended after a recommendation by the data safety  monitoring board. At this point, all patients had been  enrolled and completed treatment. Statistical analysis The primary endpoint was PFS, defi ned as the time  between randomisation and the date of fi rst documented  disease progression or death from any cause. Secondary  endpoints were event-free survival; overall survival;  disease-free survival; duration of remission; time to new  treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or death;  rates of molecular, complete, and partial remission;  response rates and survival times in biological subgroups;  rates of treatment-related adverse eff ects; pharmaco- economic eff ect; and quality of life. PFS and results of  safety and the major secondary endpoints (overall survival  and response rates) for the entire study cohort and  biological subgroups are reported here (fi gure 1). The planned sample size was calculated on the basis  of the primary endpoint, PFS. Data that were reported  before the initiation of the study indicated that the  median PFS was expected to be 40 months in the  chemotherapy group (corresponding to a 66% PFS rate  at 2 years), and 54 months in the chemoimmunotherapy  group (corresponding to a 74% PFS rate at 2 years).15 the assumption that the hazard ratio (HR) was 0·741,  using a two-sided log-rank test at the 5% level with a  power of 80%, and accounting for one interim analysis,  a minimum of 357 events were required.

To confi rm the primary analysis, a two-sided  log-rank test stratifi ed by Binet stage was done before  treatment. Exploratory analyses for the secondary  endpoints were done with two-sided stratifi ed and non- stratifi ed log-rank tests for time-to-event outcomes,  Fisher’s exact test and χ2 test for categorical variables,  and Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables.

Role of the funding source This trial was planned and initiated in 2003 as an  investigator-initiated trial by the German Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukaemia Study Group. Since 2004,  F Hoff mann-La Roche assumed the sponsorship for this  trial, because it intended to use the trial for the approval  of rituximab at regulatory agencies. The sponsor was  subsequently involved in the fi rst and second  amendments of the study protocol. The sponsor of the  study was responsible for data gathering, and shared  responsibility for medical review of the data with the  corresponding author. The corresponding author was  responsible for data analysis, data interpretation, writing  of the report, had full access to all the data in the study,  and had the fi nal responsibility for the decision to  submit for publication. Results Previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia were enrolled between July, 2003, and March,  2006. Figure 1 shows the trial profi le. Patients were  randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with  fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide, or chemo- immunotherapy with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab. Both groups were well balanced with  respect to age, sex, disease stage, physical fi tness  (cumulative illness rating scale, ECOG), creatinine  clearance, serum concentrations of β2 microglobulin  and thymidine kinase, genomic aberrations, and IGHV  mutational status (table 1). Patients in the chemotherapy  group had B symptoms more often than did those in the  chemoimmunotherapy group. Genomic profi ling data  (FISH and IGHV mutational status) were available for  624 (76%) patients.

These dose reductions were mostly because of treatment- related haematological toxicity, particularly neutropenia  and leucocytopenia (117 [62%] of 189 patients in the  chemoimmunotherapy group vs 69 [64%] of 108 in the  chemotherapy group; webappendix p 2). Signifi cantly more patients were in complete  remission in the chemoimmunotherapy group than in  the chemotherapy group (table 2). More patients  responded to treatment and more achieved a complete  remission in all Binet stages (table 2). The proportion of  patients who did not respond to treatment was lower in  the chemoimmunotherapy group than in the  chemotherapy group (39 [10%] vs 81 [20%]; p<0·0001). PFS was longer in the chemoimmunotherapy group  than in the chemotherapy group (median 51·8 months  [95% CI 46·2–57·6] vs 32·8 months [29·6–36·0];  p<0·0001; fi gure 2A). At 3 years after randomisation,  more patients remained progression free in the  chemoimmunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy  group (fi gure 2A; table 3). The risk of progression was  reduced by 44% in the chemoimmunotherapy group  compared with the chemotherapy group (HR 0·56  [95% CI 0·46–0·69]). An improvement in PFS was  noted in all stages. Patients with disease in Binet stages  B and C showed similar median PFS of 32·5 months  (28·4–36·6) and 33·0 months (25·0–41·2), respectively,  when treated with chemotherapy (fi gure 2B). Treatment  with chemoimmunotherapy improved the median PFS  to 51·8 months (47·8–56·0) in 522 patients with Binet  stage B disease (HR 0·50 [95% CI 0·39–0·65]; p<0·0001)  and to 40·7 months (0·73 [0·51–1·04]; p=0·081) in  252 patients with Binet stage C disease (fi gure 2B).

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab also  resulted in a signifi cant benefi t with respect to overall  survival. More deaths were noted after treatment with  fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide (86 [21%] of 409)  than after treatment with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab (65 [16%] of 408). In most cases, the  underlying cause of death was progressive disease  (chemotherapy 48 [56%] of 86, chemoimmunotherapy  33 [51%] of 65). ',\n"," 'Other fatal events were secondary  cancers (chemotherapy 13 [15%], chemoimmunotherapy  fi ve [8%]) and causes unrelated to chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia, such as myocardial infarction (15 [17%] and  17 [26%], respectively). At 3 years after randomisation,  more patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were  alive than in the chemotherapy group (table 4). The time  to 25% of patients dying was 62·5 months in the  chemoimmunotherapy group and 46·8 months in the  chemotherapy group (p=0·012; fi gure 3A). The risk of  death was reduced by 33% in the chemoimmunotherapy  group (n=355) compared with the chemotherapy group  (HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·48–0·92], p=0·012). The benefi t of chemoimmunotherapy was noted in  patients younger than 65 years and in those 65 years or  older with respect to the response rates and time to  progression, but not survival time (tables 2–4). Moreover,  in Cox regression analyses, age was not an independent  predictor of PFS or overall survival (table 5). Analyses of  secondary endpoints such as event-free survival, duration  of remission, and time to new treatment confi rmed  the clinical benefi t with chemoimmunotherapy  (webappendix p 1). More patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group had  a complete remission in most genetic subgroups as  defi ned by use of the hierarchical model,6 except for  patients with del(17p) or with no abnormalities (table 2). In patients with del(11q), trisomy 12, and unmutated  IGHV, chemoimmunotherapy improved rates of  complete remission by 3·5, 3·7, and 2·2 times,  respectively (table 2). At 3 years after randomisation, 76%  of 268 patients who achieved a complete remission  remained progression free compared with 45% of 549  who achieved only a partial response or a non-response  (p<0·0001); 95% of 268 patients who achieved complete  remission were alive compared with 82% of 549 who  achieved a partial response or non-response (p<0·0001). Chemoimmunotherapy resulted in signifi cantly higher  PFS in most genetic subgroups, including del(17p),  del(11q), del(13q), and trisomy 12 (table 3). The del(17p)  subgroup had the shortest median PFS (chemo- immunotherapy 11·3 months [range 10·3–12·2] vs  chemotherapy 6·5 months [0·8–12·2]; HR 0·47 [95% CI  0·24–0·90]; p=0·019). An unmutated IGHV was  predictive of a shorter PFS (table 5). ',\n"," 'Chemo- immunotherapy also improved overall survival in most  subgroups of patients, including Binet stages A and B  (but not stage C), del(13q), del(11q), and unmutated  IGHV (table 4). Del(17p), chemotherapy, unmutated IGHV status,  β2 microglobulin serum concentrations of at least  3·5 mg/L, and white blood cell count of 50×109 per L  were predictive of a reduced PFS (table 5). Variables that  were predictive of a reduced overall survival were  treatment with chemotherapy, del(17p), β2 microglobulin  serum concentrations of at least 3·5 mg/L, serum  thymidine kinase concentration of at least 10 U/L, and an  ECOG performance status of at least 1. The presence of del(17p) was the strongest negative  prognostic indicator of PFS and overall survival (table 5). Patients with this genetic abnormality showed a  signifi cantly shorter overall survival than did those in all  the other cytogenetic subgroups (p<0·0001), irrespective  of the treatment given (fi gure 3B and C). Preliminary  data about secondline treatment in patients with del(17p)  are described in the webappendix p 3. All patients who were given at least one dose of at least  one of the study drugs were included in the safety analysis. The total number of patients who had at least one grade 3  or 4 event during treatment was higher in the  chemoimmunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy  group (table 6). The frequency of side-eff ects  (eg, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, infections, tumour lysis  syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome) was not  signifi cantly diff erent in the two groups, with the exception  of neutropenia and leucocytopenia, which occurred more  often in the chemoimmunotherapy group (table 6).

More patients who were 65 years  or older than those who were younger than 65 years had  adverse events (table 6). Haematological toxicity was more  frequent in patients 65 years or older who were treated  with chemoimmunotherapy, without any increase of the  total rate of infections. Bacterial infections occurred more  frequently in patients 65 years or older than in younger  patients (table 6). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was administered  in 86 treatment cycles, for a median of 7 days in the  chemotherapy group and 6 days in the  chemoimmunotherapy group. It was given more  frequently in the chemoimmunotherapy group (n=75 vs  n=11). In 40 treatment cycles, granulocyte-colony  stimulating factor was given as prophylaxis without any  sign of neutropenia; in 46 cycles, it was administered to  treat an adverse event (neutropenia or leucocytopenia). Ten (3%) deaths were related to treatment in the  chemotherapy group, and eight (2%) in the chemo- immunotherapy group. Of these, six chemotherapy- treated patients and fi ve chemo immunotherapy-treated  patients died from infections (septicaemia [n=6],  pneumonia [n=3], hepatitis B [n=1], and cryptosporidium  gastroenteritis [n=1]). ',\n"," 'In seven patients (three in the  chemotherapy group and four in the chemo- immunotherapy group), death occurred before the third  treatment course (fatal septicaemia [n=6], sudden cardiac  death [n=1]). Discussion The combination of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab substantially increased the proportions of  patients achieving a complete remission and remaining  free of progression for 3 years. Most importantly, this  treatment also increased the likelihood of patients  surviving 3 years or more after randomisation (table 4)  and was an independent prognostic factor for overall  survival in the multivariate analysis. This result is  unexpected, because treatment of an indolent disease of  recurrent nature such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  was not thought to require an effi cient fi rst-line treatment. Why was a survival benefi t not reported in previous trials  of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia? First,  our trial is one of the largest done so far for fi rst-line  treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Therefore,  the statistical power needed to show eff ects on survival  might not have been achieved in some of the previous  studies. Second, the addition of the monoclonal antibody  rituximab to chemotherapy was shown to be more  eff ective for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  than was initially expected. Improvements in PFS and overall survival were much  greater in Binet stages A or B than in stage C, although  chemoimmunotherapy also resulted in signifi cantly  higher rates of complete remission in patients with  Binet stage C disease (table 2). This smaller benefi t in  Binet stage C might be attributable to a combined  imbalance of unfavourable prognostic factors. Since  dose reductions for prevention of haematological  toxicity needed to be maintained for the rest of the  treatment according to the protocol recommendations,  we believe that dose reductions required during early  courses of chemoimmunotherapy led to persistently  lower doses of all three drugs in patients with Binet  stage C disease. B symptoms and trisomy 12 were present slightly  more often in the chemotherapy group. To test for  potentially relevant imbalances in the study, both these  variables were included as potential covariates in the  Cox proportional hazard model.

With the exception of neutropenia and leucocytopenia,  the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, including  severe or opportunistic infections, was not increased  with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Initial reports about the use of rituximab in patients  with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had stressed the  possibility of early infusion reactions, cytokine release  syndromes, or tumour cell agglutination.32,33 However,  these side-eff ects did not arise often (<1%) in this trial. ',\n"," 'Moreover, patients older than 65 years with good  physical fi tness (defi ned by use of the cumulative illness  rating scale30 and creatinine clearance) tolerated both  treatment regimens quite well, and showed improved  outcome and survival time that were similar to those in  patients younger than 65 years (tables 2 and 4). However,  the patients’ median age of 61 years was much younger  than that of the average population of patients with  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (with a median age at  disease onset of about 70 years). Therefore, the  population in this trial represents a selection of fairly  young and physically fi t patients.

What remains to be established  is how patients given fi rst-line fl udarabine and  cyclophosphamide, or fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab will fare with second-line treatments. Data are being gathered to create a database to address  this important question. The analysis of various clinical and genetic variables  showed that the presence of del(17p) was the strongest  negative prognostic factor. Del(17p) is associated with a  dysfunction of the p53 tumour suppressor34 and a very  poor outcome after fl udarabine-based chemo- therapies.34,35 In our trial, the negative prognostic eff ect  of del(17p) was not abrogated with chemoimmuno- therapy. By contrast, the rate of complete remission in  patients with del(11q), an aberration previously  associated with a poor prognosis,36 was increased by  more than three times with chemoimmunotherapy  (table 2). ',\n"," 'Our results corroborate the results of a report  showing that this treatment might overcome the adverse  prognostic signifi cance of del(11q).37 Additional  subgroups that benefi ted greatly from treatment with  fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were  patients with trisomy 12 and del(13q) (table 2). These results suggest that a molecularly guided  treatment approach could be useful for patients with  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; those with del(17p) might  not benefi t substantially from chemo immunotherapy  with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Therefore, allogeneic stem cell trans plantation should be  off ered to patients with del(17p) who are physically fi t, if  they achieve a remission with treatments such as the  chemoimmunotherapy we used, alemtuzumab, or similar  treatments.38–40 By contrast, the combination of fl udarabine,  cyclopho sphamide, and rituximab seems an excellent  treatment choice for patients with del(11q), trisomy 12, or  del(13q). The results of this trial lend support to the  recommendation that molecular genetics (FISH) should  be used to guide treatment of patients with chronic  lymphocytic leukaemia.41 Our fi ndings show that the combination of fl udarabine,  cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as fi rst-line  chemoimmunotherapy improves the outcome of physically  fi t patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The  fi ndings of this randomised trial show an improvement of  overall survival after a specifi c fi rst-line treatment for  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These  results might help establish a new treatment model in  which the choice of a specifi c fi rst-line treatment improves  the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

In contrast, TP53 defects are not associated with resistance to the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab or methyl- prednisolone. In an attempt to improve the treatment of TP53-defective CLL, a multicenter phase II study was developed to evaluate alemtuzumab and methylprednisolone in combination. ',\n"," 'Patients and Methods Thirty-nine patients with TP53-deleted CLL (17 untreated and 22 previously treated) received up to 16 weeks of treatment with alemtuzumab 30 mg three times a week and methylprednisolone 1.0 g/m for five consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of cotrimoxa- zole, itraconazole, and aciclovir (or valganciclovir for asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia). The primary end point was response as assigned by an end-point review committee. Secondary end points were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results The overall response rate, complete response rate (including with incomplete marrow recovery), median PFS, and median OS were 85%, 36%, 11.8 months, and 23.5 months, respectively, in the entire cohort and 88%, 65%, 18.3 months, and 38.9 months, respectively, in previously untreated patients. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic and glucocorticoid-associated toxicity occurred in 67% and 23% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 infection occurred in 51% of the overall cohort and in 29% of patients less than 60 years of age. Treatment-related mortality was 5%. Conclusion Alemtuzumab plus methypredisolone is the most effective induction regimen hitherto reported in TP53-deleted CLL. The risk of infection is age related and, in younger patients, seems only marginally higher than that associated with rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide.

The disease runs a chronic relapsing course that requires multiple treatment episodes and is notable for its clinical diversity. Among the many biologic variables that correlate with clinical outcome, dele- tion of TP53 on chromosome 17p (17p ) is associ- ated with the worst prognosis. TP53 encodes the p53 protein, which is a tran- scription factor that is activated by DNA damage and coordinates the response to such damage by inducing the expression of genes that induce apo- ptosis or cell-cycle arrest or facilitate DNA repair. TP53 is the most frequently inactivated gene in hu- man cancer. In CLL, TP53 defects are found in approximately 10% to 15% of patients requiring frontline therapy 6-8 and almost 50% of patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease.

All rights reserved. one TP53 allele and mutation of the other, although in a minority of patients, the TP53 defect is monoallelic. 6-13 TP53 defects in CLL are strongly associated with low complete response (CR) rates after various chemotherapy regimens including chlorambucil, fludara- bine, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC), and FC plus mitoxantrone. 6-8,14-16 TP53 defects are also associated with a poor response to chemotherapy-based combinations that contain the anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R). Such regimens include R plus fludarabine, R plus FC (R-FC), R-FC plus mitoxantrone, R plus bendamustine, and R in combination with pentostatin and cyclophos- phamide. 17-21 These observations are entirely in keeping with the established importance of the wild-type p53 protein in mediating the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents including purine analogs. 22-24 Alemtuzumab is a humanized rat monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52, which is an antigen expressed on malignant and nonmalignant lymphocytes including CLL cells. 25,26 Alemtuzumab has useful therapeu- ticactivityinCLL 27-31 and,incontrasttochemotherapy,isnolesseffective in patients with TP53 defects. 14,32-34 However, in previously treated pa- tients with TP53 defects, alemtuzumab produced overall response (OR) rates of only 33% to 55%, with few CRs and a median PFS of only 4.7 to 7.7 months. 32-34 Similarly, the median PFS after frontline alem- tuzumab in patients with TP53 defects was only 11 months. We speculated that the effectiveness of alemtuzumab might be enhanced by combining it with a glucocorticoid (GC). Our hy- pothesis was based on 3 considerations. First, in keeping with the p53-independent action of GCs, 23,24 high-dose methylpred- nisolone (HDMP) has established activity in TP53-defective CLL. Second, alemtuzumab preferentially targets the blood and bone marrow, whereas GCs are particularly effective at reducing lymphadenopathy. Third, GC treatment may redistribute CLL cells from tissues into the bloodstream where they should be more susceptible to killing by alemtuzumab. The feasibility of combining alemtuzumab with methylprednisolone was illustrated by a small ret- rospective study in which three of five patients with TP53-defective CLL achieved a CR. In this article, we present the results of a pro- spective multicenter phase II clinical trial to formally evaluate the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab plus methylprednisolone in pa- tients with CLL and deletion of TP53. ',\n"," 'PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Design The study was designed as a single-arm, open-label trial with the primary purpose of detecting an OR rate of at least 20%. This was the expected response rate in patients with previously untreated 17p CLL after chlorambucil or fludarabine monotherapy (the standard of care in the United Kingdom when the trial was designed). Patients The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by a multicenter research ethics committee before recruitment. Patients were eligible for the study if they met all of the following criteria: were at least 18 years old, had a diagnosis of CLL that required treatment according to National Cancer Institute guidelines; had a TP53 deletion (17p ) detected by FISH in at least 20% of CLL cells, and had a WHO performance status of 0 to 2. Both untreated and previously treated patients were eligible for the study. Patients were excluded if they had severe cytopenias that were not due to CLL, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or hypertension, active peptic ulcer disease, severe renal or hepatic impairment, or any other severe medical disorder. Treatment Schedule Treatment consisted of administration of alemtuzumab three times a week for 16 weeks in combination with methylprednisolone 1.0 g/m /d for 5 consecutive days, which was repeated every 28 days for 4 cycles. Alemtuzumab was given via the intravenous route for the first 4 weeks and via the subcuta- neous route thereafter. 31,34 At the start of treatment, alemtuzumab was in- creased on successive doses from 3 to 10 mg to a final dose of 30 mg if the previous dose was well tolerated. Premedication consisted of paracetamol, chlorphenamine, and, if required, hydrocortisone. Patients received allopuri- nol, lansoprazole, and antimicrobial prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole 960 mg twiceperdaythreetimesaweek,aciclovir400mgfourtimesperday,anditracona- zole suspension 200 mg twice per day. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and ciprofloxacin were administered whenever the neutrophil count fell below 1.0  /L. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed every week. Patients with CMV viremia received oral valganciclovir instead of aciclovir. In the event of CMV reactivation associated with symptoms or end-organ damage, patients received intravenous ganciclovir, and the study treatment was interrupted until recovery. The study treatment was also inter- rupted in the event of grade 3 or 4 infection or grade 4 hematologic toxicity and discontinued in the event of disease progression. Assessments The primary end point was response. ',\n"," 'Secondary end points were safety, PFS, and overall survival (OS). Assessment of response and disease progression was based on the updated National Cancer Institute Working Group Guide- lines and included computed tomography scanning and analysis of bone marrow for minimal residual disease (MRD) by using multicolor flow cytom- etry (sensitivity 10 Full assessments were performed after 8 weeks, at completion of therapy, and at 6-month intervals thereafter until disease pro- gression. The final response of each patient after completion of therapy was assigned by an end-point review committee that consisted of 3 expert clini- cians. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Adverse events were reported until disease pro- gression or the initiation of additional treatment. Statistical Analysis PFS was defined as the time from the first drug administration until the earliest evidence of disease progression or death that resulted from any cause. Data were censored if a patient had no disease progression at the end of the trial follow-up or was given subsequent treatment before disease progression. was calculated as the time from first drug administration to death as a result of any cause. Median PFS and OS were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare OS and PFS across biologic groups. Hazard ratios were calculated along with 95% CIs. Analysis was carried out by using the statistical software environment R (version 12, http://www.R-project.org). The OR rate was defined as the number of patients who attained CR, CR with incomplete marrow recovery, or partial remission (PR) status for at least 2 months. The CR rate was defined as the number of patients who attained a full CR or CR with incomplete marrow recovery. The CR rate was compared in biologically defined subgroups by using exact logistic regression methods. Odds ratios were calculated along with 95% CI. These analyses were carried out by using STATA 11 software (STATA, College Station, TX; Computing Resource Center, Santa Monica, CA). Continuous variables were converted into two categories by taking the median or some other standard quantity as a cutoff value. Lymphadenopathy was quantified as the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of the six largest lymph nodes. For clinical staging, Binet stages A and B were combined because only four patients were at Binet stage A. ',\n"," 'A comparison of the infection rate in different patient subgroups was carried out by using Fisher’s exact test.

We conducted an international, open-label, randomized phase  3 trial to compare two oral agents, ibrutinib and chlorambucil, in previously un- treated older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS We randomly assigned 269 previously untreated patients who were 65 years of age or older and had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive ibrutinib or chlo- rambucil. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review committee. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 73 years. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than  did chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months), with a risk of progression or death that was 84% lower with ibrutinib than that with chlorambucil (hazard  ratio, 0.16; P<0.001). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival; the estimated survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death that was 84% lower in the ibrutinib group than in the  chlorambucil group (hazard ratio, 0.16; P = 0.001). The overall response rate was higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%, P<0.001). The rates of sustained increases from baseline values in the hemoglobin and platelet levels were higher with ibrutinib. Adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 20% the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea; ad- verse events occurring in at least 20% of those receiving chlorambucil included nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting. ',\n"," 'In the ibrutinib group, four patients had a grade 3 hemorrhage and one had a grade 4 hemorrhage. A total of  87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group are continuing to take ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS Ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as assessed by progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables.

Abstract BACKGROUND—Data regarding the efficacy of treatment with ibrutinib–rituximab, as compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been  limited. METHODS—In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients 70 years of age or  younger with previously untreated CLL to receive either ibrutinib and rituximab for six cycles  (after a single cycle of ibrutinib alone), followed by ibrutinib until disease progression, or six  cycles of chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. The primary  end point was progression-free survival, and overall survival was a secondary end point. We report  the results of a planned interim analysis. RESULTS—A total of 529 patients underwent randomization (354 patients to the ibrutinib– rituximab group, and 175 to the chemoimmunotherapy group).

CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid  cancers, accounting for approximately 11% of hematologic neoplasms. A marked  improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with CLL has  been realized with the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies to purine nucleoside analogue or alkylator-based chemotherapy.1,2 Phase 3 trials have established the chemoimmunotherapy regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as the standard first-line treatment for patients with CLL who are 70 years of age or younger and  who are suitable candidates for such therapy after consideration of organ function and side- effect risks.1,3 The fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab combination appears to be  particularly effective in patients with immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV)–  mutated CLL, with roughly half the patients in that subgroup remaining free from progression up to 8 years after initial treatment.4–7 Although fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab therapy is efficacious, it is associated with substantial toxic  effects, including severe myelosup-pression, a small risk of treatment-related  myelodysplasia, and infectious complications, including opportunistic infections due to T- cell immunosuppression.8 In parallel with advances in chemoimmunotherapy, elucidation of CLL B-cell biology has  identified new therapeutic targets.9 The interruption of leukemia proliferative signals  mediated through the B-cell receptor appears to be one of the most promising approaches. ',\n"," '10–12 Major effects have been seen with ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a B-cell signaling protein involved in B-cell development, differentiation, proliferation, and survival.10,13 Shanafelt et al. Page 2 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. Ibrutinib was initially found to have durable efficacy in patients who had relapsed refractory CLL.13,14 Subsequent phase 3 trials involving previously untreated patients with  progressive CLL who were too frail to receive aggressive therapy showed superior progression-free survival and overall survival with ibrutinib as compared with chlorambucil, which led to approval of the drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a first-line  treatment option.15 However, data regarding the efficacy of ibrutinib as a first-line treatment  for patients 70 years of age or younger with CLL, as compared with the efficacious chemoimmunotherapy regimen of fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab, have been limited. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial (E1912) through  the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment  with ibrutinib in combination with six cycles of rituximab, as compared with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab, in previously untreated patients with CLL who were 70 years  of age or younger. Methods Trial Participants Eligible participants were previously untreated patients with CLL or the small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) subtype of CLL who were 70 years of age or younger and who would appropriate candidates for treatment according to the International Workshop on Chronic  Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Working Group criteria (see the Supplementary  Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).16 Comprehensive eligibility criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients with chromosome 17p13 deletion were excluded from the trial because of the poor response of CLL in these  patients to fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab therapy.1,3,17 Trial Oversight This trial was designed and coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group– American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG– ACRIN) Cancer Research  Group in collaboration with the other NCTN Cooperative Groups. The trial protocol (available at NEJM.org) was approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) central institutional review board and local institutional review boards as required by participating  institutions. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration Helsinki. ',\n"," 'Data that were gathered and analyzed by trial investigators were entered into an  electronic database maintained by the ECOG– ACRIN Biostatistical and Operations Office. The trial was monitored twice annually by a standing data and safety monitoring board that  included persons from both within and outside ECOG– ACRIN. The authors reviewed and  approved the manuscript for submission for publication and vouch for the accuracy and  completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. Ibrutinib was  provided by Pharmacyclics (a subsidiary of AbbVie) under a cooperative research and  development agreement with the NCI. Randomization and Treatment After providing written informed consent, eligible participants underwent randomization, which was stratified according to the age of the patients (<60 years vs. 60 to 70 years),  Shanafelt et al. Page 3 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. ≥2; scores are on a 5-point scale, with higher  numbers indicating greater disability), Rai stage (0 to II [low or intermediate risk] vs. III or  IV [high risk]), and the presence or absence of chromosome 11q22.3 deletion on  fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to  receive either ibrutinib–rituximab or chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab. Patients who were randomly assigned to the ibrutinib–rituximab group received ibrutinib (at  a dose of 420 mg per day until disease progression or an unacceptable level of side effects  occurred) and rituximab (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 1 of cycle 2;  325 mg per square meter on day 2 of cycle 2; and 500 mg per square meter on day 1 of  cycles 3 through 7); each cycle was 28 days. Patients who were randomly assigned to the  chemoimmunotherapy group received six cycles of intravenous fludarabine (at a dose of 25  mg per square meter) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg per square meter) on days 1 through with rituximab (50 mg per square meter on day 1 of cycle 1; 325 mg per square meter day 2 of cycle 1; and 500 mg per square meter on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6) every days. Full treatment information, including instructions regarding dose delays and modifications, is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. ',\n"," 'Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii (tri-methoprim–sulfamethoxazole or alternative) and herpes zoster (valacyclovir or alternative) was given to patients in each group for 1 year  after treatment initiation. All patients received allopurinol (300 mg orally once daily) on  days 1 through 14 of cycle 1. Patients treated with ibrutinib–rituximab also received allopurinol with treatment cycle 2 (the first cycle that included rituximab). Growth factor  support was permitted per guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (see the  Supplementary Appendix).18 Assessments of Safety and Response All adverse events were graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version For the purposes of dose modification, adverse events involving platelet count and hemoglobin level were graded according to the IWCLL CLL Working Group grading scale (see the Supplementary Appendix).16 Responses were graded according to the 2008 IWCLL Working Group criteria that were effect at the start of the trial16 along with the 2018 modification that included the category of  complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery19 (see the Supplementary Appendix). Isolated treatment-related lymphocytosis in the absence of disease progression according to other criteria was not considered to indicate progression until a nadir lymphocyte count was achieved.19,20 Bone marrow biopsies were performed at enrollment and at 12 months to assess response, with central review by an expert hematopathologist (see  the Supplementary Appendix). Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in all patients at enrollment and at the evaluation for response at  12 months. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by means of peripheral-blood flow cytometry with a sensitivity greater than 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (see the  Supplementary Appendix). MRD assays were performed at the time of the 12-month  response evaluation and at 24 and 36 months after randomization. Shanafelt et al. Page 4 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. Statistical Analysis The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was defined as the time from  randomization to documented CLL progression or death without documented progression. Patients alive without documented progression had their data censored at the last disease  assessment. ',\n"," 'The trial was designed to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio for progression or death (in the analysis of progression-free survival) of 0.67 (ibrutinib– rituximab vs. chemoimmunotherapy) or less with the use of a stratified log-rank test at the  one-sided alpha level of 2.5%. The planned enrollment was 519 patients, to be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ibrutinib–rituximab or chemoimmunotherapy. With input from the FDA, interim analyses for progression-free survival were planned start at 24 to 27 months after full enrollment and annually until either the efficacy boundary  was crossed or full information (203 events of progression or death) was reached. The  prespecified boundary for the first interim analysis of progression-free survival was 2.807 on  the z-statistic scale, which corresponded to a one-sided P value of 0.0025. A truncated version of the O’Brien–Fleming boundary was to be used subsequently.21 Futility rules for  harm and inefficacy were included (see the Supplementary Appendix). Overall survival, which was defined as time from randomization to death from any cause,  was a secondary end point and was to be tested only if the result in the progression-free survival analysis crossed the efficacy boundary. Patients who were alive had their data  censored at the last date of contact. Interim analyses for overall survival were to start when  the efficacy boundary for progression-free survival was crossed and to continue annually  until early stopping criteria were met or full information (125 deaths) was reached. Critical  values at each interim analysis were to be determined with the use of the truncated O’Brien– Fleming boundary. Stratified log-rank tests22 were used to compare time-to-event distributions. Hazard ratios  were estimated with the use of stratified Cox proportional-hazards models.23 The frequency  of response and the incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups with  the use of Fisher’s exact test. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the characteristics of the patients. Time-to-event distributions were estimated with the use of the  Kaplan–Meier method. The primary analysis was conducted in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had undergone randomization, regardless eligibility or treatment status. P values are two-sided, and 95% confidence intervals are  presented. Results Patients From March 2014 through June 2016, the trial enrolled 529 patients (Table 1). ',\n"," 'total of 354  patients were assigned to the ibrutinib–rituximab group, and 175 to the  chemoimmunotherapy group. A total of 19 patients did not start the protocol-specified therapy (Fig. 1). Shanafelt et al. Page 5 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. At a median follow-up of 33.6 months, 279 of the 354 patients (78.8%) who had been randomly assigned to receive ibrutinib–rituximab continued ibrutinib therapy, and 132 of the  175 patients (75.4%) who had been randomly assigned to receive chemoimmunotherapy continued to be monitored. The mean number of treatment cycles among all the patients the chemoimmunotherapy group who started therapy was five; 67.1% of these patients (106  of 158 patients) received six cycles. At the interim analysis, the median duration treatment in the ibrutinib– rituximab group was 33.0 months (range, 1.0 to 54.0); 16.8% of  the patients discontinued therapy for reasons other than disease progression or death (Table  S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). Efficacy The first interim analysis was performed in September 2018. There were 77 events progression or death and 14 deaths (8 without progression). The Kaplan–Meier estimates progression-free survival and overall survival are shown in Figures 2A and 3, respectively. At 3 years, the percentage of patients with progression-free survival was 89.4% (95%  confidence interval [CI], 86.0 to 93.0) in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, as compared with  72.9% (95% CI, 65.3 to 81.3) in the chemoimmunotherapy group. The difference in progression-free survival crossed the prespecified boundary (hazard ratio for progression death, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.56; P<0.001). Overall survival was higher in the ibrutinib–rituximab group than in the  chemoimmunotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.54; P<0.001). Overall survival at 3 years was 98.8% (95% CI, 97.6 to 100) in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, as compared with 91.5% (95% CI, 86.2 to 97.0) in the chemoimmunotherapy group. Data regarding progression-free survival and overall survival among eligible patients who  started the assigned treatment are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. In prespecified subgroup analyses of progression-free survival, ibrutinib–rituximab was  superior to chemoimmunotherapy independent of age, sex, or Rai stage and was also superior to chemoimmunotherapy in the subgroup of patients with chromosome 11q22.3 deletion (Fig. 2C). ',\n"," 'Ibrutinib–rituximab resulted in superior progression-free survival, compared with chemoimmunotherapy, at 3 years among patients with IGHV-unmutated CLL (90.7% vs. 62.5%; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.50)  (Fig. 2B). At the interim analysis, the difference in progression-free survival at 3 years  among patients with IGHV-mutated CLL was not significant (87.7% in the ibrutinib– rituximab group and 88.0% in the chemoimmunotherapy group; hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI,  0.14 to 1.36) (Fig. S3A in the Supplementary Appendix). The percentage of patients with an overall response as determined by physical examination was higher in the ibrutinib–rituximab group (95.8%; 95% CI, 93.1 to 97.6) than in the  chemoimmunotherapy group (81.1%; 95% CI, 74.5 to 86.6). With the inclusion of CT scan  results and central bone marrow review (when possible), the incidence of complete response  with or without blood count normalization was lower in the ibrutinib–rituximab group (17.2%; 95% CI, 13.4 to 21.6) than in the chemoimmunotherapy group (30.3%; 95% CI, 23.6 to 37.7). Shanafelt et al. Page 6 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. MRD in the peripheral blood at the 12-month response assessment was evaluated in 276 of  354 patients (78.0%) who were treated with ibrutinib–rituximab and in 103 of 175 patients  (58.9%) who received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide– rituximab. A lower percentage of patients who were treated with ibrutinib–rituximab (8.3%;  95% CI, 5.4 to 12.2) than with chemoimmunotherapy (59.2%; 95% CI, 49.1 to 68.8) were  MRD-negative at cycle 12 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Safety All adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were reported in more than 2% of the patients in  either group are summarized in Table 2. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or  higher, independent of attribution, was similar in the two groups (in 282 of 352 patients  [80.1%] treated with ibrutinib–rituximab and in 126 of 158 patients [79.7%] who received  chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide– rituximab, P = 0.91). There was a lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in the ibrutinib– rituximab group than in  the chemoimmunotherapy group (90 patients [25.6%] vs. 71 [44.9%], P<0.001), as well as a  lower incidence of infectious complications, including neutropenic fever (37 patients [10.5%] vs. 32 [20.3%], P = 0.005). ',\n"," 'There was a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 hypertension in the ibrutinib–rituximab group than in the chemoimmunotherapy group (66  patients [18.8%] vs. 13 [8.2%], P = 0.002). Hemorrhagic events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 4 patients (1.1%) in the ibrutinib–rituximab group (all grade 3 events) but in no  patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group (P = 0.32). Cardiac toxic effects of grade 3 or higher occurred in 23 patients (6.5%) treated with  ibrutinib–rituximab, including 13 cases of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, 3 cases of  cardiac chest pain, 2 cases of supraventricular tachycardia, 2 cases of heart failure (nonfatal),  2 cases of pericardial effusion, 1 case of sinus bradycardia, 1 case of ventricular tachycardia,  1 case of cardiac arrest (nonfatal), and 1 case of myocardial infarction. Cardiac toxic effects  of grade 3 or higher occurred in 3 patients who received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab, including 2 cases of atrial fibrillation and 1 case  of acute coronary syndrome. Atrial fibrillation of any grade occurred in 26 patients (7.4%)  receiving ibrutinib–rituximab and in 5 patients (3.2%) receiving chemoimmunotherapy. One  patient in the ibrutinib– rituximab group had atrial fibrillation at enrollment, which was  exacerbated by ibrutinib during cycle 1; the patient had sudden death 21 days after the start  of cycle 2 of ibrutinib–rituximab therapy. A detailed summary of all adverse events of grade  3 or higher that were attributed by the treating physician to trial treatment is provided in  Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix. Causes of death are listed in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. Among the 10 deaths  in the chemoimmunotherapy group, the cause was CLL or therapy-related in the majority patients (4 deaths due to CLL, 2 due to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, 1 due to  lung cancer, 1 due to metastatic colon cancer, 1 due to drug overdose, and 1 due infection). Among the 4 deaths in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, the cause was CLL in the  minority of patients (1 death due to CLL, 1 due to lung adenocarcinoma with respiratory failure, 1 due to acute respiratory failure, and 1 sudden death in a patient with history of  atrial fibrillation).

',\n"," 'Discussion In this randomized trial involving patients 70 years of age or younger who had previously untreated CLL or SLL and did not have chromosome 17p13 deletion, ibrutinib–rituximab treatment was superior to chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine–cyclophosphamide– rituximab with respect to progression-free survival and overall survival. Chemoimmunotherapy led to a higher frequency of complete response and rendered more patients MRD-negative than did ibrutinib– rituximab therapy. Nonetheless, the risk progression or death was 65% lower and the risk of death was 83% lower with ibrutinib– rituximab than with chemoimmunotherapy. The proportion of patients who had an adverse event of grade 3 or higher was similar in the two groups. Since fludarabine–cyclophosphamide–rituximab is widely accepted as an effective  chemoimmunotherapy regimen for patients with CLL, the improvements in both  progression-free survival and overall survival that were observed with six cycles ibrutinib–rituximab followed by continuous ibrutinib therapy, as compared with the 6-month  course of chemoimmunotherapy, are notable.1,3–7 Three previous trials have shown survival advantage with one therapy over another among patients with previously untreated  CLL.1,2,15 The advantage of six cycles of ibrutinib–rituximab followed by continuous ibrutinib therapy with regard to these end points exceeded the prespecified thresholds for  superiority at the time of the first interim analysis, despite the fact that the progression-free  survival and overall survival observed among patients treated with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab was similar to or better than that anticipated on the basis of  historical studies (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).1,3 Since the current advantage  with regard to overall survival was based on a limited number of events, the long-term follow-up for survival among the patients in this trial, as well as for the incidence myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia, second cancers, and infectious complications, will be important. Ibrutinib–rituximab resulted in superior progression-free survival in high-risk subgroups, including patients with Rai stage III or IV disease, chromosome 11q22.3 deletion, and  unmutated IGHV. Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab has proved to be particularly effective in patients with IGHV-mutated CLL,5,6 with roughly  half the patients in this lower-risk subgroup remaining in remission 8 to 10 years after the  initiation of treatment.7 Longer follow-up in this subgroup of patients will provide additional  clinical insights. ',\n"," 'The safety results regarding ibrutinib–rituximab therapy in the E1912 trial were consistent  with the results of previous trials of ibrutinib-based therapy.13–15 The risk of atrial  fibrillation of any grade was 7.4% in the ibrutinib–rituximab group. The recently reported  Alliance 041202 trial, which tested first-line ibrutinib–rituximab therapy and ibrutinib monotherapy, showed that the incidence of atrial fibrillation in these two groups was 14%  and 17%, respectively, among patients with CLL who were 65 years of age or older (median  age, 71 years).24 An age of 65 years or older, history of hypertension, and history of atrial  fibrillation are risk factors for the development of atrial fibrillation during ibrutinib  treatment,25 which suggests that the lower incidence of cardiac complications in the E1912  Shanafelt et al. Page 8 N Engl J Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 February 01. trial may be due to the younger patient population (median age, 58 years) relative to a  pooled analysis of patients participating in other trials (median age, 67 years).25 Unexplained or unwitnessed death, which can be due to cardiac arrhythmias, was observed in only 1 patient in the E1912 trial, as compared with 11 of 361 patients (3%) treated with  ibrutinib in the Alliance 041202 trial.24 Grade 3 or 4 hypertension in patients who were  treated with ibrutinib–rituximab in the E1912 trial also occurred at a lower frequency than  that seen among patients in the Alliance 041202 trial (18.8% vs. 34%).24 Major hemorrhagic events (all grade 3) occurred in 1.1% of the patients in the ibrutinib–rituximab group, with  no fatal events. As of the interim analysis, one case of nonfatal cardiac arrest has been  observed in the E1912 trial. Given the long-term, indefinite use of ibrutinib, we continue to  monitor this end point closely. The superior overall survival with ibrutinib-based therapy that was observed in the E1912  trial but not in the Alliance 041202 trial is notable because the chemoimmunotherapy that  was used in the E1912 trial is more efficacious than the chemoimmunotherapy used in the  Alliance trial.3 Several possible factors may contribute to these findings. First, more  efficacious therapy may contribute more to survival prospects in younger patients with CLL  with fewer coexisting conditions, who are less likely than older patients to die from  unrelated causes. ',\n"," 'Second, more severe treatment-related toxic effects, including an increased  risk of sudden death among older patients, may offset decreases in disease-related mortality  among older patients. The higher mortality among patients receiving active treatment in the  Alliance trial (7% of patients treated with ibrutinib–rituximab) relative to the participants in  the E1912 trial (1%) and reported outcomes in a study in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtypes support this notion.26 Although all the ibrutinib-treated patients in the E1912 trial also received rituximab, the  benefits of combining rituximab with ibrutinib are unclear. No differences in progression- free survival or overall survival between the ibrutinib-alone group and the ibrutinib– rituximab group in the Alliance 041202 trial have been observed to date,24 a finding that is  consistent with the results of a randomized comparison of ibrutinib alone and ibrutinib– rituximab in a trial predominantly involving patients with relapsed CLL.27 It is unclear  whether these findings can be extrapolated to patients 70 years of age or younger with  previously untreated CLL. In conclusion, among patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL,  the combination of six cycles of ibrutinib–rituximab therapy followed by ibrutinib given  continuously until relapse resulted in progression-free survival and overall survival that were  superior to those with 6 months of chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine– cyclophosphamide–rituximab. However, indefinite use of ibrutinib therapy has been associated with substantial expense28 and the potential for long-term toxic effects and may  increase the risk of clonal selection leading to drug resistance.29,30 Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.

Patients who are refractory or relapse after  ibrutinib experience poor outcomes. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of  BCL-2 that has activity in heavily-pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. This phase  two, multicentre, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax  for patients with CLL refractory to or who relapsed during or after ibrutinib. Methods—Patients at least 18 years of age were eligible for study enrollment if they required  therapy according to criteria from the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL), had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of ≤2,  adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μL irrespective of growth factor  support, platelet count ≥30,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL), and creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min. At study entry, all patients were screened for Richter’s transformation by positron emission  tomography and were excluded if Richter’s transformation was confirmed on biopsy. Patients  received venetoclax starting at 20mg daily with stepwise dose ramp-up over five weeks to the  target 400mg daily dose. For patients with rapidly-progressing disease, an accelerated schedule of  administration was utilized. Treatment continued until disease progression or discontinuation due  to other reasons. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  venetoclax monotherapy. Efficacy was measured by overall response rate, defined as the  proportion of patients with an overall response based on the investigator’s assessment per iwCLL  criteria. Safety was evaluated via adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments. ',\n"," 'adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments. This study  is ongoing and data for this interim analysis per regulatory agency request were collected as of  June 30, 2017 and included all patients who received at least one dose of venetoclax. This trial was  registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02141282. Findings—Patients were recruited from 15 sites across the United States between September 2014 and November 2016. The study enrolled 91 patients who previously received ibrutinib, 43 in  the main cohort and 48 in the expansion cohort. At the time of analysis, the median time on study  (ie, follow up) was 14 months (range: 0·1–31; IQR: 8–18) for all 91 patients, 19 months (range:  0·1–26; IQR: 9–27) for 43 patients in the main cohort, and 12 months (0·1–18; IQR: 8–15) for 48  patients in the expansion cohort. An objective response was achieved in 59 (65%) of 91 patients  (95% CI: 53%, 74%. Main cohort: 30 [70%] of43, 95% CI: 54%; 83%; expansion cohort: [60%] of 48, 95% CI: 43%, 72%). Eight (9%) of 91 patients achieved complete remission.

Interpretation—Venetoclax showed durable clinical activity and favourable tolerability patients with CLL whose disease progressed during or after prior treatment with ibrutinib. INTRODUCTION Small molecule inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCRi) signaling target an essential biology in  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and have rapidly supplanted cytotoxic chemotherapy for both untreated and relapsed disease.1,2 The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has demonstrated high rates of durable response and prolonged survival and is  approved for the treatment of previously-untreated or relapsed CLL.3–6 Although many patients achieve sustained disease control with continuous ibrutinib, few  effective options are currently available for CLL progressing during or after therapy. ',\n"," 'Relapse  in high-risk patients (ie, 17p deletion [del(17)(p13·1)] and/or complex abnormal karyotype)  is more frequently observed, with a 30-month estimated progression-free survival (PFS) for  patients with del(17)(p13·1) of 48% vs 87% for patients without del(17)(p13·1) or del(11) (q22·3).4,7,8 Adverse events (AEs) can further lead to discontinuation.9 Optimal therapy for patients with CLL progressing after ibrutinib has yet to be determined in prospective studies. Outcomes after discontinuing ibrutinib are poor and progression can  occur rapidly, in part due to the limited efficacy of available therapies in this setting.7–9  Recent investigations have identified acquired resistance mutations in the ibrutinib binding  site C481 of BTK and/or phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCG2) in the majority of patients who progressed while receiving ibrutinib.7,10 New therapies in the setting of disease progression  following ibrutinib are critical. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor that approved in the United States for patients with del(17)(p13·1) CLL who have received least one prior therapy and in the EU and other countries for patients who are unsuitable for  Jones et al.

Additionally, the ability of venetoclax to eliminate ibrutinib- resistant clones bearing BTK C481S or PLCG2 mutations has not been evaluated. Given the promising activity of venetoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL13,14 and poor outcomes in patients who relapsed after or are refractory to ibrutinib, we conducted the  present study to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax in this population. METHODS Study Design and Participants This phase two, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter trial enrolled patients with CLL  relapsed after or refractory to ibrutinib (includes discontinuation of prior ibrutinib due to  AEs followed by progression off therapy). Patients were enrolled initially in the main cohort  of the study and a subsequent study amendment permitted enrollment expansion to further  establish the activity of venetoclax in patients with CLL relapsed/refractory to BCRi therapy  (expansion cohort). ',\n"," 'Patients were enrolled in study arms based on the last BCRi received  (Figure 1). Accrual of approximately 40 patients was planned initially (main cohort) and a  subsequent study amendment permitted accrual of up to 60 additional patients to collect  additional data and further establish the activity of venetoclax in patients with CLL relapsed/ refractory to BCRi therapy (expansion cohort) (Figure 1). A separate cohort of patients with  CLL relapsed/refractory to idelalisib (n=36) was also included in this study and will be  reported in a separate publication. Ten patients who were previously treated with idelalisib  were included in the analysis reported here because ibrutinib was the last BCRi they  received prior to enrollment in this study. Patients were recruited from academic, public, and  private hospitals and clinics in the United States. The washout period for prior BCRi was  seven days in the main cohort and reduced to three days for the expansion cohort. The  primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax monotherapy. Efficacy was measured by objective response rate (ORR) and safety was evaluated via adverse event monitoring and laboratory assessments. Patients at least 18 years of age with relapsed/refractory CLL who required therapy according to the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria were enrolled if their disease was refractory to treatment or progressed after  discontinuation of ibrutinib.15 Per protocol, the definitions of relapse and refractory were  based on iwCLL 2008 criteria.15 Relapse was defined as a patient who had previously achieved a response to treatment, but after a period of 6 or more months, demonstrated evidence of disease progression and refractory was defined as treatment failure or disease  progression within 6 months to the last anti-leukemic therapy.15 Patients were evaluated for  Richter’s transformation at study entry by positron emission tomography, mandatory biopsy  for lesions with high standardized uptake value, and excluded if confirmed on biopsy. Patients with active and uncontrolled autoimmune cytopenias, unresolved toxicity from prior  Jones et al. Page 4 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. therapy, or a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation within one year of study entry  were also excluded. There was no minimum estimated life expectancy mandated for study  entry, provided all protocol inclusion criteria were met. ',\n"," 'Karyotype was not assessed at the  time of screening for the study and therefore data for complex karyotype are not available. Other mutational data (ie, TP53 mutation status, chromosomal abnormalities) were reported  by investigators. All molecular subtypes of CLL were included in the study. All patients  provided written informed consent. Complete enrollment criteria provided in the appendix  (p.4). The institutional review board at each participating site approved the study protocol. The  study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Procedures Venetoclax was administered orally, once daily. Patients received venetoclax 20mg daily for  one week, followed by weekly ramp up to 50mg, 100mg, 200mg, and then to the final daily  dose of 400mg by week five (appendix p.7); in the expansion cohort, an accelerated dose  ramp up over three weeks was permitted for patients who had high tumor burden with clinical signs of progression during screening (appendix p.8). Additionally, dose escalation  of venetoclax to 600mg was allowed in the expansion cohort for patients who had not  achieved an adequate response after assessment at week 12. The on-target effects venetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumour size (debulking) and may pose a risk tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) during initial dosing. To mitigate this risk, prophylaxis and  monitoring procedures were implemented, which are described in the appendix (p.8). Safety was monitored through 30 days post treatment. Laboratory assessments and AE monitoring were done throughout the study and into the 30-day post-treatment period. AEs  were graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, version 4·0.16 Laboratory monitoring for TLS was conducted during the 5-week dose ramp-up and TLS was assessed based on criteria established by Howard and colleagues.17 Dose adjustments were recommended for patients with grade 3 or 4 AEs. At the time of the  first event, venetoclax could be interrupted and dosing resumed at the target dose following  resolution of the AE. If subsequent AEs required dose interruptions, dosing could resume at  a lower dose following resolution of the AE. For neutropenia, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) could be administered concurrently with venetoclax as needed  and was strongly recommended for patients with grade 4 events (absolute neutrophil count  <500/μL). ',\n"," 'If the patient developed febrile neutropenia or grade 4 neutropenia persisted for  more than one week despite growth factor support, then venetoclax dosing was interrupted until recovery of neutrophil count >500/μL. Following dose interruption, venetoclax could  then be re-initiated at a lower dose. For blood chemistry changes or symptoms suggestive TLS, dosing on the next day was withheld unless there was resolution of changes/symptoms within 24–48 hours of the last dose; subsequently dosing resumed at the same dose. changes or symptoms resolved more than 48 hours after the last dose, dosing was resumed at  a lower dose (see also appendix p.9).

Treatment continued until disease progression or discontinuation due to other reasons and  patients were removed from the study at the time of disease progression and/or  discontinuation of venetoclax for other reasons. Outcomes The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with overall response based on the investigator’s assessment.15 Response was assessed by the  investigator based on physical exam, laboratory results, computed tomography or magnetic  resonance imaging, and bone marrow evaluation according to iwCLL criteria.15  Assessments were performed at screening and subsequent responses for patients in the main  cohort were assessed by investigators at weeks eight, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter, to one year. For patients in the main cohort, response data upon completion of 24 weeks on  venetoclax were also reviewed by an independent review committee (IRC). Patients in the  expansion cohort underwent response assessments at weeks 12 and 36. Responses were confirmed by a second assessment at least two months after first assessed. Bone marrow  aspiration and biopsy were performed at screening and within two months after other criteria  for complete remission (CR) were observed. All patients, including those identified having stable disease, received venetoclax until disease progression or discontinuation due to  other reasons. This open-label phase 2 trial was a proof-of-concept study that was designed  to assess the efficacy of venetoclax in ibrutinib-treated patients at earlier time points (weeks  8 and 24) in the main cohort. Responses improved over time in patients from the main  cohort as they have been evaluated every 12 weeks after week 24 for up to one year. ',\n"," 'Once  established that there was efficacy in this population, the expansion cohort had an increased  duration of efficacy assessment to keep consistent with the pivotal trial of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with del(17)(p13·1) CLL and to allow for pooled analyses across  venetoclax monotherapy trials in the future.13 Secondary endpoints included time-to-event analyses. Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the number of days from the date of first response to the earliest recurrence disease progression. If a patient was still responding, then the patient’s data were censored at  the date of the patient’s last available disease assessment. Patients who never had a response  had censored data on the date of enrollment. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the  number of days from the date of first dose or enrollment if not dosed to the date of earliest  disease progression. All events of disease progression were included regardless of whether  progression occurred while the patient was taking venetoclax or had previously  discontinued. If the patient did not experience disease progression, then the data were  censored at the date of the last available disease assessment. PFS was defined as the number  of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression or death. Data  were censored at the time of last tumor assessment for patients without an event or at the  time of data cutoff if the assessment was done after the cutoff date. Overall survival (OS)  was defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death for all  dosed patients. For patients who did not die, data were censored at the date of last study visit  or the last known date to be alive, whichever was later. Jones et al. Page 6 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was an exploratory endpoint. Six-color flow cytometry (sensitivity: 10–4) performed according to ERIC protocol18,19 was used to evaluate MRD in  peripheral blood for all patients beginning at week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter for  those achieving partial remission (PR) or better. ',\n"," 'Exploratory identification of BTK and  PLCG2 mutations was performed for all patients enrolled to the main cohort according published methods.20 Health economic and patient-reported outcome measures (eg, EORTC  QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 [measure of health related quality of life specific CLL] and EQ-5D-5L [measure of general health status with visual analogue scale]) were  also exploratory assessments that will be reported in a separate publication. Methods for  exploratory analyses of MRD evaluation and resistance mutation testing, as well pharmacokinetic assessments are in the appendix (p.12). Statistical Analysis This study is ongoing and data for this interim analysis per regulatory agency request were  collected as of June 30, 2017. Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who  received at least one dose of venetoclax. Exploratory MRD and resistance mutation analyses  are included for patients with available data. Analyses were performed by using SAS  software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Initial target enrollment for the main cohort of the study was approximately 60 patients, with  40 patients with ibrutinib-resistant/refractory CLL in one arm and 20 patients with idelalisib-resistant/refractory CLL in the second arm (reported in a separate publication). With the initial activity of venetoclax observed in patients in the main cohort, a subsequent  study amendment permitted additional enrollment of approximately 60 patients with either  ibrutinib- or idelalisib-resistant relapsed/refractory CLL in the expansion cohort, which was  similar to the number of patients targeted for the main cohort. Patients who had received  both agents and any additional interim therapy were enrolled into the corresponding arm on  the basis of their most recent BCRi treatment. There were no planned hypotheses testing on  the primary efficacy endpoint, ORR. ORR is presented by a point estimate and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. A sample size of 20 patients ensured that the  distance of true rate was within 23% of the observed rate, with 95% confidence interval (CI). A sample size of 40 patients would ensure that the distance of true rate was within 17% of  the observed rate, with 95% confidence. A sample size of 60 patients would ensure that the  distance of true rate was within 14% of the observed rate, with 95% confidence. ',\n"," 'ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with an overall response based on the investigator’s assessment and calculated for all patients based on iwCLL criteria.15 The 95%  confidence interval based on binomial distribution was constructed for calculated ORR. DOR, TTP, PFS, and OS were key secondary endpoints based on investigator assessment and were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology, with median time-to-event calculated along with the corresponding 95% CI.

RESULTS Patients Patients were recruited from 15 sites across the United States between September 2014 and  November 2016. A total of 91 patients were enrolled (main cohort, n=43; expansion cohort,  n=48), with all 91 patients included in demographics, efficacy and safety analyses described  below. Primary reasons for discontinuation of prior ibrutinib included disease progression (50 [55%] of 91 patients; based on iwCLL criteria15 with or without evidence of BTK or  PLCG2 mutation during treatment), and AEs (30 [33%] of 91 patients; these patients subsequently progressed after discontinuing ibrutinib). The remaining patients had achieved  maximal clinical benefit with ibrutinib (6 [7%] of 91 patients), completed a defined course  of treatment (3 [3%] of 91 patients), and/or discontinued for other unspecified reasons (2  [2%] of 91 patients) with subsequent CLL progression. ',\n"," 'Per iwCLL criteria definitions,15 (31%) of 91 patients relapsed during or after discontinuation of prior ibrutinib and 62 (68%)  of 91 patients were refractory to prior ibrutinib (Table 1). Screen failures occurred in 27  patients, six of whom were excluded based on biopsy-confirmed Richter’s transformation (see appendix p.14 for all reasons for screen failures). Disposition on Treatment As of June 30, 2017, median time on study (ie, follow up) was 14 months (range: 0·1–31;  IQR: 8–18); 19 months (range: 0·1–26; IQR: 9–27) for the main cohort and 12 months (range: 0·1–18; IQR: 8–15) for the expansion cohort. Forty-six (51%) of 91 patients continue venetoclax treatment (appendix p.14). The primary reason for discontinuation venetoclax was CLL progression in 22 (24%) of 91 patients and Richter’s transformation five (5%) of 91 patients (see appendix p.15). The remaining patients discontinued for AEs (6  [7%] of 91 patients), proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in remission (5 [6%]  of 91 patients), consent withdrawn (1 [1%] of 91 patients), investigator’s request (1 [1%] of  91 patients), and other reasons (5 [6%] of 91 patients). Seventeen (19%) of 91 patients died,  with seven due to CLL progression; seven deaths occurred within 30 days after the last dose  of venetoclax due to disease progression, Corynebacterium sepsis, multi-organ failure, septic  shock, possible cytokine release syndrome on subsequent therapy, mechanical asphyxia, and  one cause of death was unknown. None of these deaths were attributed to treatment with  venetoclax. Jones et al. Page 8 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. Efficacy The investigator-assessed ORR was 59 (65%) of 91 patients (95% CI: 53%, 74%) (Table and median time to first response was 2·5 months (range: 1·6–15) and median time to best  response was 7·9 months (range: 3·5–19). Fifty-one (56%) of 91 patients achieved PR or  nodular PR (nPR), and 8 (9%) of 91 patients achieved CR or CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi). Median time to first PR/nPR was 2·6 months (range: 1·6–16.4) and  to confirmatory second assessment per protocol (at least two months after first assessed) was  7·6 months (range: 5–17·7). Median time to CR/CRi was 8·2 months (range: 3·5–19). Twenty-two (24%) of 91 patients had stable disease as best response and five (6%) had CLL  progression. ',\n"," 'Nineteen (59%) of 32 patients with B symptoms at baseline reported resolution  of symptoms by week eight. For patients in the main cohort who had been treated for a median of 19 months, responses were observed for 30 (70%) of 43 patients (95% CI: 54%, 83%). Following a median time  on venetoclax of 12 months, the response rate for patients in the expansion cohort was 29  (60%) of 48 patients (95% CI: 43%, 72%), with 13 patients having stable disease and four  with progression. Two patients in the expansion cohort escalated to a daily dose of 600mg  venetoclax due to clinical progression, and neither had improvement at higher dose. seven patients in the expansion cohort who were scheduled to receive accelerated ramp up  due to rapidly progressive CLL, five were able to reach the target 400mg dose with four  achieving PR and one patient discontinued due to CLL progression. The two remaining patients discontinued due to CLL progression before reaching the 400mg dose. Response rates at 24 weeks reported by an IRC in the 43 patients in the main cohort were  similar to those assessed by the investigators (IRC, 30 [70%] of 43; investigator-assessed, [67%] of 43).21 Evaluations were discordant between investigators and IRC for ten patients;  two with CR by investigator assessment were deemed as PR by IRC, one with investigator- assessed CR was evaluated as CRi by IRC, two with investigator-assessed nPR were PR by  IRC, two with investigator-assessed PR were non-responders per IRC, and three patients with stable disease by investigator assessment were considered PR by IRC. Discrepancies were primarily due to differences in interpretation of splenomegaly by CT scan, the sum  product of the lymph nodes by radiographic assessment given different nodes chosen, and  timing of the CT scan. The investigator-assessed median TTP for all patients was 24·7 months (95% CI: 19·6, -),  with an estimated rate at 12 month of 80% (95% CI: 69%, 87%) (Figure 2A). Median PFS  was 24·7 months (95% CI: 19·2, -), with an estimated 12-month PFS rate of 75% (95% CI:  64%, 83%) (Figure 2B); the estimated 12-month OS was 91% (95% CI: 83%, 95%; Figure 2C). Among responding patients, median DOR has not yet been reached (95% CI: 17·6, Figure 2D), and estimated 12-month DOR was 88% (95% CI: 76%, 95%).

Among responding patients who discontinued prior ibrutinib due to AEs, median DOR had not yet been reached  (95% CI: 14·3, -), with an estimated 12-month of 89% (95% CI: 63%, 97%). For patients who discontinued prior ibrutinib due to disease progression, median DOR on venetoclax was  21·7 months (95% CI: 16·6, -), with an estimated 12-month rate of 88% (95% CI: 67%, 96%). Response rates were similar for patients with high-risk chromosomal abnormalities compared with patients without these factors. Of patients with known del(17)(p13·1) and/or  TP53 mutation, 28 (61%) of 46 patients (95% CI: 45%, 75%) achieved an objective response, including 4 CR or CRi and 23 nPR or PR. Of patients who did not have either del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation, 30 (67%) of 45 patients (95% CI: 51%, 80%) achieved an objective response, including 4 CR and 26 nPR or PR. Median PFS was 19·6  months (95% CI: 15·4, 24·7) for patients with known del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation, with a 12-month PFS estimate of 72% (95% CI: 56%, 83%). For patients without these chromosomal abnormalities, median PFS had not yet been reached (95% CI: 19·2, -) and 12- month estimate was 79% (95% CI: 64%, 89%). OS estimate at 12 months for both patients with or without known del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation was 91% (95% CI: 78%, 97%). For responders, median DOR was 21·9 months (95% CI: 17·6, -), with 12-month estimate 92% (95% CI: 73%, 98%) for patients with known del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation.

Efficacy analyses for patients with lymph nodes <5 cm as measured at baseline compared with ≥5 cm are described in the appendix (p.18). Fifty-seven patients were assessed for MRD in peripheral blood beginning at week 24, with  MRD being an exploratory endpoint of the study. Twenty-four (42%) of 57 patients assessed  achieved a MRD-negative result in peripheral blood (Figure 3A; 24 [26%] of all 91 patients  per intent-to-treat principles), with five of 13 patients assessed demonstrating subsequent  MRD-negativity in bone marrow. For the majority of patients who had an MRD-positive assessment in peripheral blood, the actual percentage of CLL cells present were low (Figure  3A). At the inception of the study, there was no plan to discontinue venetoclax so all five  patients who achieved MRD-negativity in both peripheral blood and bone marrow are currently active on study and continue venetoclax treatment. One patient who achieved MRD-negativity in peripheral blood at 5 months subsequently discontinued venetoclax due  to CLL progression at 13 months on therapy. Median PFS had not been reached for patients  with MRD negativity in blood and was 24·7 months (95% CI: 15·4, -) for patients who were  MRD positive (Figure 3B), and there was a significant difference in PFS between MRD- negative and MRD-positive patients (p=0·01 by log-rank test).

There was no difference in PFS for patients  with versus without mutations (median PFS for patients with mutations was 21·9 months and  was 15·4 months for patients without mutations; p=0·96 by log-rank test). In ten patients with BTK C481S mutations, samples were available at baseline and the end  of the first week of therapy, with allelic frequency shown in the appendix (p.19). Additionally, in eight patients from one institution with C481S mutations, samples were  available at baseline and the end of 24, 48, and 72 weeks of therapy (appendix, p.19). these eight patients, allelic frequency of C481S BTK decreased in all, and tended to re- emerge prior to progression (appendix, p.19). Safety Across all 91 patients, the most common AEs of any grade were neutropenia in 56 (62%)  patients, nausea in 51 (56%) patients, anaemia in 48 (53%) patients, diarrhoea in 47 (52%)  patients, and thrombocytopenia in 43(47%) patients (Table 3); the frequency of these AEs  was similar for the main and expansion cohorts. Treatment-emergent grade 3/4 events were  primarily hematologic and included neutropenia in 46 (51%) of 91 patients, anemia in 26  (29%) of 91 patients, thrombocytopenia in 26 (29%) of 91 patients, and lymphocytopenia 14 (15%) of 91 patients. Median time to the first grade 3/4 event was 21 days (range: 1–723)  for neutropenia and 21 days (range: 1–582) for thrombocytopenia. Twenty-four (26%) of 91  patients had pre-existing neutropenia and 54 (59%) of 91 patients had thrombocytopenia. Twenty-seven (30%) of 91 patients received G-CSF during the study for management neutropenia and/or infections. Forty-five (50%) of 91 patients experienced a serious AE,  with the most frequent serious AEs (in more than 2 patients) being febrile neutropenia in 10  (11%) and pneumonia in 5 (6%) of 91 patients. Serious AEs considered possibly related venetoclax treatment were febrile neutropenia (n=2), pneumonia (n=1), increased potassium  levels (n=1), hyperphosphatemia (n=1), and hyperkalemia (n=1). ',\n"," 'Thirty-two (35%) of 91  patients interrupted venetoclax because of AEs, with neutropenia being the most common  reason for dosing interruption in 9 patients. Fifteen (16%) of 91 patients required a dosage  reduction, most commonly due to nausea in 12 patients, neutropenia in 11 patients, and  diarrhoea in 9 patients. All dose adjustments for laboratory abnormalities occurred during  dose ramp up. Six patients discontinued venetoclax due to AEs of multi-organ failure, dysphagia and stomach ulcers, Corynebacterium sepsis, salivary gland cancer, and mechanical asphyxia. Four patients discontinued within 30 days of starting venetoclax and  two patients discontinued after one year of therapy with salivary gland cancer and asphyxia. Six deaths occurred within 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax due to AEs Corynebacterium sepsis (n=1), multi-organ failure (n=1), septic shock (n=1), possible Jones et al. Page 11 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. cytokine release syndrome on subsequent therapy (n=1), mechanical asphyxia (n=1), and  one cause of death was unknown (n=1) (Table 3). Electrolyte abnormalities  (hyperphosphatemia and hyperuricemia or hyperkalemia, respectively) meeting Howard criteria17 for laboratory TLS were only observed in two patients with high tumour burden;  both cases occurred during the 200mg dose of the standard ramp-up period. DISCUSSION Ibrutinib therapy has transformed the management of both untreated and relapsed CLL. However, acquired resistance to ibrutinib, most commonly observed in the setting previously treated and high-risk genomic disease, has been associated with poor outcomes. 8,10,26 Effective management and treatment for these patients represents an unmet need. Here, we report results of the first prospective study of any therapy for patients who were  previously treated with ibrutinib, of whom 50 (55%) of 91 patients discontinued ibrutinib  due to disease progression and 30 (33%) of 91 patients due to AEs. The rate of response venetoclax was high, with an investigator-assessed ORR of 59 (65%) of 91 patients (95%  CI: 53%, 74%). Responses were also observed for patients with historically poor outcomes,  including those who discontinued prior ibrutinib due to disease progression and those with  high-risk chromosomal abnormalities del(17)(p13·1) and/or TP53 mutation. ',\n"," 'Safety data are  consistent with previous reports of single-agent venetoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL, with  the frequency of adverse events reported for this heavily pre-treated population of patients  with CLL refractory to or relapsed after ibrutinib being similar to that reported for  venetoclax in a broader relapsed/refractory CLL population.13,14 Despite observations highly proliferative disease in relapsed CLL upon discontinuation of ibrutinib, venetoclax  was not associated with an elevated risk for TLS when recommended dose ramp up, prophylaxis, and monitoring were applied. As expected in this heavily-pretreated population,  cytopenias and febrile neutropenia were commonly observed. All cases were effectively managed with dosage adjustment and/or supportive care and did not lead to discontinuation of venetoclax. Per secondary Kaplan-Meier analyses, responses have been durable. Additionally, four five patients who initiated venetoclax via accelerated dose ramp up due to high tumour  burden and signs of rapid progression at screening achieved PR on venetoclax. Across efficacy and safety results, the outcomes on venetoclax reported for these patients who were  previously treated with ibrutinib are similar to results with venetoclax monotherapy broader relapsed/refractory CLL patients.14 Venetoclax acts as a BH3-mimetic, targeting BCL-2 in mitochondria independent of BCR  signaling, and as such we hypothesized that BTK mutant clones would not confer resistance to venetoclax.26 In the subset of patients for whom available mutation data were available,  we observed responses with venetoclax in 12 (71%) of 17 of cases where known ibrutinib resistance mutations were present at study entry, which supports the hypothesis based on  mechanism of action. Furthermore, the allelic frequency of C481S BTK decreased for eight  patients with serial data available up to 72 weeks on venetoclax, suggesting the potential for  venetoclax to eradicate ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones. Jones et al. Page 12 Lancet Oncol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 01. A number of studies evaluating a broad range of therapeutic approaches have assessed the  relationship between MRD and outcomes, and available evidence suggests that patients with  MRD-negative status at the end of treatment have improved survival, independent of clinical  response.27 In the current study, patients achieving MRD-negative responses experienced superior PFS, despite the fact that most achieved an objective response no better than PR. The majority of these patients with MRD-negative PR had low-volume residual nodal disease by imaging criteria. ',\n"," 'This study has the following limitations including that this was a proof-of-concept study to  first evaluate the activity of venetoclax in this population so was designed to be an open- label study. Furthermore, the wide confidence intervals for the ORR reported due to the  number of patients in each cohort. Efficacy analyses were limited by mutational status (eg,  IGHV) and karyotype status as data collection was not uniform; data for complex karyotype  was not available and IGHV testing was incomplete as accessible historic data were reported  by investigators at study start. Additionally, longer follow up will be needed to better  establish the durability of response to venetoclax in this patient population. This publication only reports on the patients who received ibrutinib as their last BCRi prior  the enrollment on the study. As ibrutinib and idelalisib are approved for different indications  and in different regions, the patients who received idelalisib as their last BCRi prior the  enrollment will be reported in a separate publication to provide adequate attention to each  patient population. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes have not yet been fully analyzed  and will be reported at a later time. In conclusion, venetoclax achieved a high rate of response among patients progressing after  ibrutinib, including a subset with ibrutinib-resistance mutations, many of whom have heavily  pre-treated disease harboring high-risk genetic aberrations. Venetoclax has demonstrated durable clinical activity and favourable tolerability across high-risk patient groups, including  results from this prospective study of treatment for patients with CLL progression following  ibrutinib.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this study Evidence accumulated prior to the study suggested that signaling via B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway could play an important role in the development of CLL. The  advent of BCR inhibitors (BCRi) transformed treatment for chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia (CLL), though patients who are refractory or relapse after these therapies experience poor outcomes. We searched PubMed for clinical trial reports up to end 2014 (year of study start), to identify novel agents for treatment of CLL, using the terms:  “chronic lymphocytic leukemia” and “CLL” in addition to “targeted therapy” “novel” “agent.” For the timeframe searched, 42 articles were identified. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, demonstrated high rates of durable response and was approved for previously-treated patients with CLL. Though many patients can have sustained disease control on ibrutinib, patients with high-risk prognostic factors (eg, chromosome 17p deletion) often relapse and some developed resistance mutations even after achieving an initial response to therapy. Effective treatment options for patients who relapsed or were refractory to ibrutinib had not been  well characterized at the time of this study initiation. At the time of study initiation in 2014, optimal therapy for patients with CLL relapsed/ refractory to ibrutinib had yet to be determined in prospective studies and represented critical unmet need in CLL treatment. Venetoclax is an orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor, with a mechanism of action that is  independent of the BCR pathway. Added value of this study To the best of our knowledge, this phase 2 study was the first prospective trial to evaluate  treatment for patients progressing on or following ibrutinib. Based on prior data venetoclax monotherapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, we hypothesized that  venetoclax would be tolerable and achieve responses in patients with CLL relapsed/ refractory to ibrutinib. ',\n"," 'Venetoclax had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with other  clinical studies of venetoclax monotherapy, and is highly active in patients with CLL  relapsed/refractory to ibrutinib. Moreover, responses to venetoclax were reported among  patients with baseline ibrutinib-resistance mutations, with allelic frequency of mutations  decreasing with time on therapy for patients with serial assessments, suggesting the  potential for venetoclax to eradicate ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones. Implications of all the available evidence Few effective options are currently available for CLL progressing during or after ibrutinib, and our data support the use of venetoclax monotherapy in this patient population. Importantly, data on ibrutinib resistance mutations indicate that venetoclax may potentially eradicate ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones, which has not yet been reported  in the context of a prospective clinical trial and represents an important advance in the  management of ibrutinib-resistant CLL.

Patients received rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil every four weeks for six cycles. Rituximab plus chlorambucil-treated patients without a complete response after Cycle 6 received chlorambu- cil monotherapy for at least six additional cycles or until complete response. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (confirmed by bone marrow biopsy) after Cycle 6 in first-line patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease, and safety. Overall, 357 patients were randomized (rit- uximab plus bendamustine, n=178; rituximab plus chlorambucil, n=179; intent-to-treat population), including 241 first-line patients (n=121 and n=120, respectively); 355 patients received treatment (n=177 and n=178, respectively; safety population). In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; P=0.002) and median progression-free survival (ritux- imab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil,  30 months; P=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall sur- vival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus ben- damustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% vs. 36%). Overall adverse event incidence was similar (rituximab plus bendamustine, 98%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 97%). \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/GitHub/exBERT/data/preprocessed_data/text_data_step2.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n","  for item in train_chunks_1:\n","    f.write(item+\"\\n\")\n"," "],"metadata":{"id":"vuNZLzahVjW3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648905768414,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":229,"user":{"displayName":"Lya Solis","userId":"00474828135331575492"}}},"execution_count":251,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"fE2mn7NOqn1C"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls /content/drive/MyDrive/GitHub/exBERT/data/preprocessed_data/"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"km-yKwejYWVk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648905772068,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":229,"user":{"displayName":"Lya Solis","userId":"00474828135331575492"}},"outputId":"4293bc41-cd99-4778-e3fe-e097ea256f14"},"execution_count":252,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["batch1_ner.csv\t batch2_text.csv  ner_data_step1.csv\n","batch1_text.csv  batch3_ner.csv   text_data_step1.csv\n","batch2_ner.csv\t batch3_text.csv  text_data_step2.txt\n"]}]}]}
